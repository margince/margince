# desktop: the self-contained macOS and Windows builds

One folder that runs the whole Margince stack locally (Postgres, the event
bus, the api, the worker and the web UI) with no Docker and no
prerequisites. The user starts it and Margince opens in their browser.

**Status: proof of concept.** It boots, migrates, serves the UI and survives a
restart. It is not signed for distribution and several surfaces are off by
default.

```sh
make desktop        # macOS   -> build/desktop/margince/          (first run ~5 min)
make desktop-win    # Windows -> build/desktop/margince-windows/  (must run ON Windows)
```

Each platform builds on itself: the macOS lane compiles Postgres and Valkey
with the Xcode tools, and the Windows lane needs MSVC for pgvector and MSYS2
for Redis. Neither cross-builds from the other.

The macOS folder usually cannot run from `build/desktop/`: the socket path is
capped at 103 bytes and a repo checkout is normally deep enough to exceed it,
depending on where you cloned. The launcher measures the
path and says so. Copy it somewhere shorter, then start it:

```sh
cp -R build/desktop/margince ~/Margince
cd ~/Margince && ./margince
```

Windows has no such limit. Postgres listens on loopback TCP, so the folder runs
from anywhere.

## The documentation

This directory holds only the sources. Everything else lives in `docs/`, so
there is one copy to keep true:

- **[How to build, run, configure and update it](../docs/how-to/build-the-desktop-app.md)**:
  every `make desktop-*` target on both platforms, the settings file, the
  update gesture, and the failure table.
- **[Why it is shaped this way](../docs/explanation/desktop-distribution.md)**:
  why it must carry its own Postgres (pgvector is not in `contrib`), how
  relocatability is enforced, the update contract the layout encodes, why the
  two platforms differ where they do, and the known limits.
- **[Every flag and environment variable](../docs/reference/configuration.md)**

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `build/macos-target.sh` | macOS: the one place the supported OS floor lives; pins `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` and fails the build if any binary needs newer |
| `build/build-postgres.sh` | macOS: relocatable Postgres 16 + pgvector + contrib, compiled from source |
| `build/build-valkey.sh` | macOS: the event bus |
| `build/build-app.sh` | macOS: api, worker, migrate, frontend, launcher |
| `build/build-dist.sh` | macOS: assemble and verify the distributable folder |
| `build/common.ps1` | Windows: shared helpers: pinned downloads, the MSVC shell, fail-on-native-error |
| `build/build-postgres.ps1` | Windows: stage PostgreSQL 16, compile pgvector against it with MSVC |
| `build/build-bus.ps1` | Windows: the event bus, Redis 7.2 built under MSYS2 |
| `build/build-app.ps1` | Windows: api, worker, migrate, frontend, launcher |
| `build/build-dist.ps1` | Windows: assemble and verify the distributable folder |
| `build/build-windows.ps1` | Windows: all four in order; the entry point, since a Windows host need not have `make` |
| `../.github/workflows/desktop-macos.yml` | The macOS lane on a runner: the only thing that proves these scripts still work, since they cannot run elsewhere |
| `../.github/workflows/desktop-windows.yml` | The same for Windows |
| `launcher/` | The Go supervisor: stdlib only and outside `go.work`, so it imports no product code. It starts the shipped binaries as child processes |

### The launcher is one program, split where the platforms differ

`main.go`, `layout.go`, `envfile.go`, `web.go` and `services.go` are shared:
the folder layout, the settings file, the SPA server and the proxy list are the
same product on both. Only the files Go selects by name diverge, and each says
in its header why:

| File | What is different, and why it has to be |
|---|---|
| `postgres_unix.go` / `postgres_windows.go` | macOS: unix socket, trust auth, supervised child, SIGINT. Windows: no socket exists, so loopback + scram-sha-256, and `pg_ctl` because `postgres.exe` refuses to run under an administrator |
| `process_unix.go` / `process_windows.go` | POSIX signals vs. a `CTRL_BREAK` console event to the child's own process group |
| `platform_unix.go` / `platform_windows.go` | Executable suffix, which bus binary ships, how the local timezone is read, how a browser is opened, and whether the console has to be held open to read a failure |
