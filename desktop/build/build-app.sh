  # Install at the REPO ROOT, build in frontend/. The lockfile is a root pnpm

  # from a subdirectory or rewrite it. The Dockerfile's web stage splits the two
  # steps for the same reason and is the reference for this lane.
  #
  # --ignore-scripts matches every other frontend install in this repo (the
  # Dockerfile, scripts/verify-boot.sh, the CI lane): a lockfile pins WHAT is
  # installed, and this stops a dependency's lifecycle script from running
  # arbitrary code on the build machine on the way in.

  #
  # A unit's frontend layer is NOT a member of the root workspace
  # (pnpm-workspace.yaml says why: membership would make an installation that
  # enables its own frontend-bearing unit unable to run --frozen-lockfile
  # against an upstream-owned lockfile). Its react, @tanstack/react-query and
  # @types/react are linked out of frontend/node_modules by the GENERATED
  # workspace instead, so the root install alone leaves a unit screen resolving
  # neither its peers nor its dev deps — and the composed build below
  # typechecks those screens.
  #
  # This lane got away without it while the root lockfile still carried stale
  # `extensions/*/frontend` entries from the era when they WERE members: they
  # supplied the peers by accident. A lockfile regeneration correctly dropped
  # them, and this build broke on the next change to touch desktop/ — the
  # failure being TS2307 "cannot find module 'react'" in a unit's screen, which
  # names neither this script nor the missing step.
  #
  # --no-frozen-lockfile because that lockfile is generated build output, which
  # is what the Makefile's own invocation says at greater length.
