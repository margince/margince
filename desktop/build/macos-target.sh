#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. clang defaults its deployment target to the OS of the
# machine doing the build. Left alone, every C binary here is stamped
# LC_BUILD_VERSION minos = whatever the builder happened to be running, and
# macOS refuses to launch a binary whose minos is newer than the host. The
# bundle would then work for everyone on the build machine's macOS or newer and
# fail for everyone else — with a floor nobody chose, nobody wrote down, and
# that moves every time the builder takes an OS update.
#
# 12.0 is not arbitrary: it is Go's own floor for this toolchain, so the C
# halves (Postgres, the bus) and the Go halves (api, worker, migrate, the
# launcher) agree on one number instead of disagreeing silently. Raising it
# means raising Go's too; check what a Go binary reports before changing it:
#
#     vtool -show-build <a built Go binary> | grep minos
MACOS_MIN="12.0"
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="$MACOS_MIN"

# assert_min_os <file>... — no shipped binary may require a NEWER macOS than
# the floor above.
#
# A check rather than a comment, because the failure it guards is invisible on
# the machine that causes it: the builder's own Mac always satisfies whatever
# floor the builder's own Mac produced.
