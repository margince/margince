# Build a relocatable PostgreSQL + pgvector for darwin-arm64.
#
# "Relocatable" is the whole point: the result must run from wherever the
# user drags Margince.app, so nothing inside it may reference an absolute
# path outside itself. Postgres finds its own share/ and lib/ relative to
# the running executable, so the binaries are already position-independent
# once the Mach-O load commands are rewritten to @rpath — which is what
# the relocate step below does.
#
# Only the three contrib modules the schema actually requires are built
# (unaccent, pg_trgm, btree_gist); building all of contrib drags in
# optional system dependencies we deliberately configure away.
