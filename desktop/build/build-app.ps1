# Build the Margince-authored half of the Windows bundle: the three process-role
# binaries, the frontend, and the launcher that supervises them.
#
# The server binaries are built through build/composition/, not with a bare
# `go build`, because that wiring is what links the enabled extensions/ units
# in. A bundle built against the vanilla stub would silently ship without the
# first-party packs and look identical from the outside.
#
# There is no signing step. macOS refuses to execute a binary whose signature
# is invalid, so that lane must sign; Windows has no equivalent requirement and
# Authenticode needs a purchased certificate rather than an ad-hoc one. What
# the user sees instead is a SmartScreen warning on first launch -- documented,
# not worked around.
