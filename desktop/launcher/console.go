// The repo's lint baseline forbids fmt.Print* in favour of slog, and it is right
// to everywhere else: structured output is what a log collector reads. This is
// the one place that rule does not fit. A contact double-clicks a starter and
// watches a console window; what they need to read is

//	Margince is running at  http://127.0.0.1:8800

// and not that line wrapped in key=value framing. The structured logs still
// exist and still go through slog — they are the SERVICES' logs, written to
// data/logs/ by startChild, which is a different channel with a different
// reader.
//
// So the output is funnelled through one function and the waiver is stated once,
// here, with its reason. Seventeen //nolint comments across two files would say
// the same thing seventeen times and drift the moment one of them was copied
// somewhere it did not belong.
//
// Failures are not reported: a console write that fails has nowhere left to
// report to, and the caller's next line would fail identically.
