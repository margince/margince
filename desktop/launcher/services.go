// childEnv is the environment a role inherits, in three layers: what this

//
// EVERY DSN is in the third layer rather than on the command line. A Windows DSN
// carries the database password, and any local process can read another
// process's arguments — the same reason initdb is handed its password in a file
// (postgres_windows.go). An environment is not secret either, but reading
// another process's takes more than `ps`. Nothing in margince.env can displace
// them, because they come last and the last value of a duplicated key wins.
//
// MARGINCE_ENV is in the FIRST layer, and that is a deliberate reversal.
//
// A serving role boots on a license or it does not boot, and MARGINCE_ENV is
// fail-closed: an installation that names nothing is production and is held to a
// license it was never issued. So a desktop bundle pinned to production could
// not start at all — which is what happened, with the reason buried in api.log.
//
// `dev` is what a single person running their own copy actually is. What it
// costs is narrow and worth naming precisely, because the obvious fear is
// wrong: it does NOT arm the admin data-reset endpoint. That needs
// operations.allow_data_reset in margince.yaml, which layout.go never writes,
// and the posture alone leaves it a 404. What the posture does change is that
// /me reports non_production, and that a license minted by a test authority
// would be honoured — this installation has neither.
//
// It is a default rather than a decision, so an operator who HAS a license can
// put MARGINCE_ENV=production in margince.env and be held to it.
// MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_PATH is in the first layer for the same reason as
// MARGINCE_ENV: it is a default, not a decision. A desktop installation has
// local disk and no object storage service, and with no store wired the api
// answers 501 on every attachment and serves no company logo — so the folder
// points the filesystem provider at data/blobs and the feature simply works.
// An operator who names a real S3 endpoint (or another path) in margince.env
// overrides it, because the user layer comes after this one.

// aiFlags drives the AI surfaces with the offline fake, always — and that is

// The api prefers a STORED binding over this flag: a bound installation uses
// its models and the flag is inert. So passing it unconditionally says only
// "answer from the fake if nothing is bound", which is what a fresh install
// wants — the surfaces respond with canned text instead of reading as broken.
//
// The launcher therefore no longer looks for a routing file, and no longer
// needs to: the user binds real models in Settings -> AI, with the provider key
