# Capture connectors — the inbound integration seam & the mail pipeline

`internal/modules/capture` (interfaces.md §1, capture.md CAP-*) is Margince's **inbound**
integration surface: a *connector* talks to an external provider (Gmail, an IMAP mailbox, Microsoft
365 / Outlook via Graph, Google Calendar), normalizes each provider record onto the clean relational
core, and hands it to the **one** `connector.Sink` the capture module owns. It is the mirror image of
[outbound-webhooks.md](outbound-webhooks.md): that is the governed *egress* surface, this is the
governed *ingress* one.

For the one-paragraph version see [reference/modules.md](../reference/modules.md); to actually *connect
and test* a mailbox, jump to [how-to/connect-a-mailbox.md](../how-to/connect-a-mailbox.md); for the
write shape every captured row commits through and the bus the pipeline rides, see
[write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md).

## The core principle

**A connector normalizes; the Sink writes.** A connector is a small, pure-ish thing — it knows how to
authenticate to one provider, pull records incrementally from a cursor, and map one raw record to domain
structs. It knows *nothing* about how the CRM stores data, who may see it, or how an event ships.
Everything security-relevant — RBAC, the workspace transaction, provenance, audit, the outbox event,
idempotency — lives behind the **one** Sink, so it happens in exactly one place, once per record:

```text
provider record ──▶ connector.Normalize ──▶ Sink.Upsert  (ONE transaction)
                    (pure mapping, no I/O)     ├─ raw_capture    the re-parseable original
                                               ├─ domain row     person / organization / activity
                                               ├─ audit_log      stamped: connector principal
                                               └─ event_outbox   the domain event

              idempotent on (source_system, source_id) — a replay is a free no-op
```

Two invariants ride on top of that write:

- **connector ≤ human.** A connector's declared scopes must be a subset of the granting human's *live*
  scopes, enforced at connect time (`ErrScopeExceeded`) — exactly the discipline agents follow. Every
  connector declares `ScopeRead` / `TierAutoExecute` for **capture**: what it pulls in is never more
  than its granting human may see.
- **Capture is read-only; transmission is a separate seam.** Two connectors additionally implement an
  *optional* send seam — Gmail (`connector.EmailSender`, requesting `gmail.send` alongside
  `gmail.readonly` on one consent, because Google will not add a scope to an existing refresh token)
  and Telegram (`connector.MessageSender`). Neither is reachable from the capture path: the outbound
  side is owned by the `comms` module, staged as a durable row, re-checked against the staging human's
  live seat at transmit time, and gated by consent. See
  [outbound-messaging.md](outbound-messaging.md).
- **Connecting is human-only.** Every connector op is `x-agent-access: human-only` (bar the session-less
  OAuth callback). An agent self-granting read of a human's personal mail is precisely what we never
  allow.

## The connector interface

Every integration implements `connector.Connector`
(`internal/shared/ports/connector/connector.go`), registered by `Descriptor().Name`:

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Descriptor()` | Static metadata read at registration — the stable name, declared `Scopes`, the 🟢/🟡 `RiskTier`, the `Produces` entity types. Drives the scope gate and contract gen. |
| `Authenticate(req)` | Establishes/refreshes credentials for one per-user, per-workspace connection; returns the opaque `Auth` bundle the other methods reuse. |
| `Sync(auth, cursor, sink)` | Pulls **incrementally** from `cursor` (history API / delta token / UID watermark), emits records via the Sink, returns the advanced cursor. |
| `Normalize(raw)` | Maps ONE raw provider record to domain structs. **Pure — no I/O** — so the mapping is the agent-edited, test-guarded surface. Returns `ErrSkip` for deliberately excluded input. |
| `HealthCheck(auth)` | Feeds the ops surface; an outage degrades capture, never blocks the CRM. |

Two **optional** seams a connector implements only when its provider supports them — the registry
type-asserts and skips a connector that doesn't:

- **`Watcher`** — a renewable push subscription (Gmail's 7-day Pub/Sub watch). A provider with no
  renewable push simply is not a `Watcher`.
- **`Backfiller`** — bounded date-backward enumeration of a mailbox (`EstimateBackfill` +
  `BackfillPage`). A provider that can't page backward is not a `Backfiller`, and the backfill engine
  refuses honestly rather than pretending.

## The one Sink — where the security lives

`Sink.Upsert` is the single write path (the core-principle diagram above): one transaction commits the
raw original + the domain row + the `audit_log` entry (stamped from the *connector* principal, never
forgeable) + the outbox event, idempotent on the `(source_system, source_id)` natural key so any replay
— a re-delivered push, a re-anchored cursor, an overlapping backfill page — collapses to a no-op.

One pipeline concern runs *inside* the Sink, before anything is written:

- **Counterparty auto-create (PO-F-1/PO-F-2).** Every captured message names the human on the other side
  (direction-classified against the mailbox owner). The Sink routes it through the people module's **one
  dedupe chokepoint**: an exact match reuses, a fuzzy match creates-and-records for the review queue. An
  erased address stays dead (A13).

  The **company** is not created here. Capture used to derive an organization from every non-consumer
  mail domain, which manufactured companies named after people (`sebastian@kestner.example` became
  "Kestner"). It now records an open question in `organization_domain_disposition` and a `domain_triage`
  site read answers it: a `company` verdict creates the organization from what the site states, and a
  `personal` / `provider` verdict refuses one for good. Consumer mail is answered by its own domain and
  asks nothing — the shipped baseline plus the workspace's own `capture_freemail_domain` list.
  The `ThreadKey` (Gmail `threadId` / Graph `conversationId` / the RFC822 `References` root) is the
  reply-detection join key behind `engagement.reply`.

## Credentials & the vault

A connector credential — an OAuth refresh token, or a standing IMAP password — is **never** stored in
the clear and never on the `capture_connection` row. It is sealed with AES-256-GCM under
`MARGINCE_KEYVAULT_ROOT_KEY` (base64 of 32 bytes) into the operational `vault_secret` table; the
connection row carries only an opaque, workspace-scoped `credential_ref`. `Registry.Connect` seals
before it commits and **refuses loudly** if the vault is absent, rather than persist a credential in the
clear. A key that is set but not exactly 32 bytes is a boot error, never a silent fallback.

**Every** connect path requires the vault, IMAP included: without `MARGINCE_KEYVAULT_ROOT_KEY` the
connector surface answers `501` rather than fall back to storing a credential anywhere else. Disconnect
is the mirror — it destroys the sealed secret, so withdrawing a connection removes the credential, not
just the row. The worker migrates any legacy `auth`-bytea rows onto the vault at boot (idempotent).

## How records arrive — four ingestion modes

A connector's records reach the CRM through one of four paths, all converging on the same Sink:

1. **Bounded backfill — preview before spend.** On connect, a `Backfiller` fills the
   CRM *backward* over a chosen window. The connector's `EstimateBackfill` returns only the provider-side
   message count; the `/backfill/preview` endpoint pairs that count with an estimated AI cost it derives
   separately — together the consent surface, shown *before* anything runs. `StartBackfill` enqueues a job the
   worker walks one page per tick, committing the cursor per page so a crash resumes honestly. Windows
   are **widen-only** (3m → 6m → 12m); cancel keeps every row already captured.
2. **Continuous incremental sync — the sweep.** The worker's dispatcher (every `30s`) selects **due**
   connections (`status IN ('connected','error')` AND `next_sync_at ≤ now`) and runs one `SyncOnce`
   each. Pacing lives in the `capture_sync_state` sidecar (`next_sync_at = success + 2m`). A failure
   never kills a connection — the sidecar backs off (`2m·2^n`, capped `4h`, ±20% jitter), degrades to a
   daily probe after 20 consecutive failures, and heals on one success. The error taxonomy
   (`rate_limited | unreachable | auth | history_gone | internal`) surfaces as `last_sync_error_class`.
3. **Push — Gmail only.** With a Pub/Sub topic configured, Gmail delivers change notifications to `POST
   /webhooks/gmail` (a shared-secret token + Google OIDC when set); the handler zeroes the mailbox's
   `next_sync_at` and enqueues an immediate sync. Push is a *latency* optimization over the poll, not a
   separate write path.

4. **Channel long poll — Telegram only.** A messaging channel is not one human's mailbox: an admin
   binds one bot for the whole workspace, and the installation *pulls*. Telegram's two ingress modes
   are mutually exclusive per bot — it answers `409` to `getUpdates` while a webhook is registered,
   and only one `getUpdates` consumer may hold a bot at a time — so unlike Gmail there is no poll for
   a push to layer over. A dispatcher (`telegram_poll_sweep`, every `30s`) due-scans live bindings and
   enqueues one `telegram_poll` per connection, declared unique on its args so a second poll for the
   same bot cannot be in flight; each holds a long poll and hands its batch to `telegram_ingest`. The
   honest latency bound is one dispatcher tick. Because it pulls, **the installation needs no public
   address and no inbound endpoint**. There is no backfill: the Bot API has no history endpoint.
   Connecting one: [how-to/connect-telegram.md](../how-to/connect-telegram.md).

Incremental sync moves *forward* from the connect-time watermark; backfill pages *backward* on its own
token; they never fight, and the capture key makes any overlap a no-op.

## Connecting — the OAuth flow

The standing connectors (`gmail`/`gcal`/`graph`) share one handshake (`capture/oauthflow`). Only the
connect step is worth a picture — everything after is the sync above:

```text
1. POST /connectors/{gmail|gcal|graph}/connect      (human session)
      → sign state (HMAC key, TTL 10m) + set CSRF cookie
      → return authorize_url  ──▶  user consents at the provider

2. GET /connectors/{provider}/callback              (session-less redirect target)
      → verify signed state + CSRF cookie + code
      → exchange code → REFRESH TOKEN
      → Registry.Connect:  scope ⊆ human?  →  seal token in vault  →  capture_connection (connected)
      → redirect to /#/…/connect/ok    (the SPA re-reads GET /connectors to prove it)
```

The access token is minted fresh per sync from the refresh token and **never persisted**. IMAP does **not**
use this flow — there is no consent redirect and no code exchange; its app-password is posted straight to
`POST /connectors/imap/connect`, which probes it and seals it exactly as `Registry.Connect` seals a
refresh token (see below).

## The connectors

All five register in `internal/compose/capture.go`; every one produces `activity` on the way in, and
two of them can also transmit. The differences that matter:

| | **Gmail** | **IMAP** | **Graph** (Outlook) | **Calendar** (gcal) | **Telegram** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | OAuth `gmail.readonly` + `gmail.send` | IMAPS app-password | OAuth `Mail.Read` + `Mail.Send` | OAuth `calendar.readonly` | BotFather bot token |
| Connection | standing, per human | standing, per human | standing, per human | standing, per human | standing, **per workspace** (an admin binds one bot) |
| Cursor | `historyId` | UID watermark | `deltaLink` | `syncToken` | `getUpdates` offset |
| Push | Pub/Sub 7-day | — (poll) | — (poll) | — (poll) | — (long poll, exclusive per bot) |
| Backfill | ✔ | — | ✔ | — | — (the Bot API has no history endpoint) |
| Send | ✔ (`EmailSender`) | — | ✔ (`EmailSender`) | — | ✔ (`MessageSender`) |
| Connect UI | onboarding + Settings | onboarding + Settings | onboarding + Settings | Settings only | Settings only (its own card) |

### Gmail — standing OAuth, push-capable, send-capable

OAuth2 to Google with **two scopes on one consent**: `gmail.readonly` for capture and `gmail.send` for
the governed outbound path (no `gmail.modify`, no settings, no delete). They ride one consent because
Google will not add a scope to an existing refresh token — asking later would mean a second connection
for the same mailbox. A mailbox connected before the send scope landed captures normally and refuses
every send by name until it is reconnected. Incremental sync
walks the **history API** from a `historyId` watermark; a stale watermark (`ErrHistoryGone`, Gmail
expires it ~weekly) degrades to a bounded re-list, not a full re-scan. It implements **both** optional
seams: a `Watcher` (the Pub/Sub 7-day push watch, renewed by the worker every `6h`, `48h` ahead of
expiry) and a `Backfiller` (3/6/12-month widen-only windows). **To run:** a Google OAuth app + the vault
key; a Pub/Sub topic is optional (without it, capture runs on the 2-minute poll). **UI:** a first-connect
affordance from both the onboarding **Google** chip and the Settings **Add a connection** footer, plus the
backfill panel; the Settings roster reconnects/disconnects.

### IMAP — standing, vault-backed, poll-only

IMAPS (TLS-only, port 993) with a username + an **app-password**. The connection is **standing**, exactly
like the OAuth trio: connect probes the credentials (dial, login, close), `Registry.Connect` seals the
whole credential bundle — the app-password included — into the vault, and the row carries only the
opaque `credential_ref`. From then on the background sweep dials fresh each cycle with the sealed
credential and advances a **UID watermark** (`uidvalidity` + `last_uid`, bound to the mailbox it was
taken in), so each pull resumes where the last stopped. **Disconnect destroys the sealed credential** —
that is what makes handing over an app-password revocable from inside the product, and it is the one
custody guarantee worth relying on.

The app-password is a durable secret in the vault for as long as the connection stands. Nothing logs it,
no read surface returns it, and it never touches the connection row — but "used once and thrown away" it
is not. Revoke it at the provider, or disconnect here, and it is gone.

There is no push and no backfill (IMAP implements neither `Watcher` nor `Backfiller`), so latency is the
poll interval and the mailbox's history before connect is not imported. The dialer is **SSRF-guarded**
(`netguard.RefusePrivate`, checked post-DNS on the concrete IP), so it refuses private/loopback hosts —
you cannot point it at a localhost mailserver. **To run:** the vault key, plus the host + port + username
+ app-password (both Gmail and Outlook block basic-auth IMAP with a normal password). **UI:** the same
inline form is reachable from both the onboarding **IMAP** chip and the Settings **Add a connection**
footer; it answers with the connected row, not a capture tally — the connect returns before any mail is
read.

### Microsoft Graph — standing OAuth, poll-only

OAuth2 to the Microsoft identity platform with delegated permissions `offline_access User.Read
Mail.Read Mail.Send` (tenant defaults to `common`) — mail read for capture and send for the governed
outbound path, on **one consent**, because Microsoft will not add a permission to an existing refresh
token. A mailbox connected before the send permission landed captures normally and refuses every send
by name until it is reconnected. Incremental sync walks a **delta query** from a `deltaLink`; a stale
link (`ErrDeltaGone`, HTTP 410) re-anchors to a bounded 7-day window. It is a `Backfiller` and an
`EmailSender` but **not** a `Watcher` — there is no change-notification subscription built, so Outlook
latency is the poll interval, not a push p95.

Sending submits the whole RFC822 message to `/me/sendMail`, rendered by the **shared** wire builder
(`capture/mailwire`) that Gmail's send uses — one answer to what a multipart/alternative puts first and
where base64 folds. Microsoft acknowledges without naming a message id, so the sent copy is resolved
afterwards by filtering Sent Items on `internetMessageId`; that same filter is the at-least-once retry
guard, and unlike Gmail's (which searches for an identity Gmail has already discarded) it reads the
message's own property. It still does not close the window — Exchange may rewrite the identity on
submission depending on tenant configuration. **Microsoft carries less than Gmail**: the MIME submit
ceiling is 4 MB of base64, so `Carriage` declares ~3 MiB per file where Gmail declares 25 MiB, and an
over-large message parks with an honest reason instead of drawing an opaque refusal. **To run:** a Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) app + tenant + the vault key. **UI:** a
first-connect affordance from both the onboarding **Microsoft** chip and the Settings **Add a connection**
footer; the roster manages an existing connection. Microsoft **rotates the refresh token on every redemption**, and the replacement is now persisted: the
connector reports it through `CredentialRotator` and the registry re-seals it into the vault on each
sync (see *Honest limitations*). The stored original would otherwise have aged out on Microsoft's
**90-day inactive lifetime** for a confidential client. A grant can still be ended from Microsoft's side
— a password change, an admin revoke, a conditional-access policy — and then the sync/connect path
surfaces `reauth_required` and the user must **reconnect**.

### Google Calendar (gcal) — standing OAuth, poll-only

OAuth2 to Google with `calendar.readonly`. It **reuses the same Google OAuth app as Gmail**, but as its
*own* authorization requesting the calendar scope alone (deliberately no `include_granted_scopes`, so the
mail-read grant never bleeds into this credential). Incremental sync uses a `syncToken`; a stale token
(`ErrSyncTokenGone`) re-anchors. No push, no backfill. **To run:** the *same* Google app as Gmail, with
the calendar scope enabled and a `/connectors/gcal/callback` redirect URI added, + the vault key. **UI:**
Settings **Add a connection** starts it (no onboarding chip for Calendar — Gmail, Microsoft, and IMAP are
the three onboarding chips); the roster manages an existing connection.

## Where each piece runs

Capture spans both process roles ([the four `cmd/<role>` binaries](architecture.md)):

- **`api`** serves the *interactive* surface: `connect` (OAuth and IMAP alike), `callback`,
  `disconnect`, `list`, backfill `preview`/`start`(enqueue)/`status`/`cancel`, the Gmail push webhook,
  the morning `digest` read, the capture-settings toggle, and the consumer-mail domain list.
- **`worker`** runs *every background pull* as leader-elected River periodic jobs: the sync dispatcher
  (`30s`) → per-connection `SyncOnce`, the backfill engine (one page/tick), the Gmail watch-renewal scan
  (`6h`), and the nightly capture suite (classify hourly, enrich + digest daily). The Surface-B agent
  runner shares the worker process but is a *separate* scheduler — it does not run capture.

Gmail/Graph OAuth needs its config on **both** roles (the api connects, the worker syncs). The full
flag/env table is [reference/configuration.md → Capture connector OAuth](../reference/configuration.md).

## The connect UI

Two entry points, both hitting the same API, and between them able to *start* every backend-live
connector — the connect-initiate gap the roster used to have (a connection with no way to add it) is
closed: onboarding starts Gmail, Microsoft, and IMAP; Settings adds those three plus Google Calendar,
which has no onboarding chip and so is Settings-only.

- **Onboarding → connect step** (`onboarding-connect-panels.tsx`) — where a fresh install *adds* a
  connection. `OAuthConnectPanel` is parametrized by provider (`gmail` or `graph`): a full-page OAuth
  redirect, then it proves the connection and renders the `BackfillPanel` (window → estimate → start →
  live progress) for the ones that support it. `ImapConnectPanel` is a form that posts the
  app-password and shows the connected row — never a capture tally, because the connect answers before
  any mail is read. The connect step (`connect-act.tsx`) offers three live chips — **Google**,
  **Microsoft**, and **IMAP** — Microsoft included; there is still no onboarding chip for Calendar.
- **Settings → Integrations** (`connectors.tsx`, `ConnectorsCard`) — the standing-connection roster: a
  status badge (`connected` / `reauth_required` / `error`) + last-synced per connection, a **reconnect**
  action for a `reauth_required` OAuth connection, and a confirm-gated **disconnect**. Below the roster
  (or in the empty state, when nothing is connected) sits an always-present **"Add a connection"**
  affordance offering whichever of **Gmail**, **Google Calendar**, **Microsoft**, and **IMAP** aren't
  already connected — an OAuth pick redirects to that provider's consent screen directly from Settings; an
  IMAP pick opens the same inline form. A provider whose backend app isn't configured answers its declared
  `501`, and the panel renders "{provider} isn't configured in this deployment" rather than a raw error.
  It sits next to the `WebhooksCard` (the egress side).

## Honest limitations

The pipeline is live; these were scoped out, not missed:

- **No onboarding chip for Calendar.** `gcal` is a fully wired OAuth connector (same
  `connect`/`callback`/`disconnect` + sync as Gmail/Graph); Settings' **Add a connection** footer starts
  one, but the onboarding connect step's three chips (Google, Microsoft, IMAP) don't include it — adding
  Calendar during first-run onboarding still means a trip to Settings afterward.
- **Graph is poll-only.** The change-notification subscription (validationToken handshake, `clientState`,
  ≤3-day renewal) is unbuilt, so Outlook latency is the poll interval. (Gmail has both halves — the
  push-watch renewal sweep and the `/webhooks/gmail` consumer above — so a Gmail deployment with a
  Pub/Sub topic configured is push-driven, with the poll behind it as the safety net.)
- **Graph refresh-token rotation is persisted** (it was not, and the gap is closed). Microsoft issues a
  NEW refresh token on every redemption; the old one stays valid for its own lifetime, but that lifetime
  is a ceiling — 90 days idle for a confidential client, shorter after a password change, an admin revoke
  or a conditional-access policy — so a connection that never stored the replacement aged out on a
  schedule nobody set. `connector.CredentialRotator` is the optional seam (type-asserted like `Watcher`
  and `EmailSender`, so the frozen `Connector` interface is unchanged); the registry binds a per-sync
  sink that re-seals into the vault under the same generation fence the cursor commits under, and
  retires the superseded blob only after the row naming its replacement commits. A re-seal that fails
  costs one cycle's freshness, never the mail — the old credential is still valid, which is what makes
  that the right way round. A connection can still reach `reauth_required` from a real revoke.
- **IMAP has no backfill and no push.** It syncs forward from connect time on the poll; mail older than
  the connection is not imported, and there is no `Backfiller` to import it.
- **No dedicated connector-health screen.** The digest's `connectors[]` health rows surface as a single
  summary link on the home digest card (the worst-offending connection's error class, linking to Settings)
  rather than a per-connector health screen.

## Rules of thumb

- **The connector normalizes; the Sink writes.** A connector never touches the CRM, the workspace
  transaction, audit, or the outbox — audit + provenance + event + idempotency all live in the one
  Sink, once per record.
- **connector ≤ human.** A demoted human instantly narrows every grant the sync runs under.
- **Capture is idempotent on `(source_system, source_id)`.** Replays, re-anchored cursors, overlapping
  backfill pages — all no-ops.
- **A failure degrades a connection, never kills it.** `error` is syncable (daily probe); only
  `disconnected`/`reauth_required` park a row.
- **Connecting is human-only.** An agent never self-connects a mailbox.
- **The credential leaves the connection row entirely** — vault-sealed under `credential_ref`, IMAP's
  app-password included, and destroyed on disconnect. A provider that REPLACES it on use (Microsoft does,
  on every redemption) reports the replacement through `CredentialRotator`, and the re-seal obeys the
  same fence and the same destroy-the-old rule.
- **All four connections are standing** and sync in the background; only Gmail/Graph backfill and
  send; only Gmail pushes.
