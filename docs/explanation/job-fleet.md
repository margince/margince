# The job fleet — the declaration, the dispatcher, and one row per tenant

Background work in this backend runs on [River](https://riverqueue.com), a Postgres-backed job queue:
a job is a row in the `river_job` table, workers claim rows, and retries, timeouts and scheduling are
River's to run. What this page describes is the contract we put **on top** of River.

That contract has two halves. Every job kind is **declared** in `backend/api/jobs.yaml` before it
exists in code — and the declaration is what the running system obeys, so a worker cannot choose its
own timeout, its own queue or its own attempt cap. And every fleet-wide pass is **two** kinds: a
dispatcher that enumerates the fleet (the "fleet" is every workspace on the installation) and
enqueues, plus a worker that carries exactly one unit's work.

This is the deep reference. To *add* a job, jump to [how-to/add-a-job.md](../how-to/add-a-job.md);

for the write shape every workspace pass commits through, see
[write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md).

```

**Why two kinds and not one loop.** Before this split every sweep carried its own copy of the
workspace scan and its own inline per-workspace loop. A tenant whose pass failed became a log line
*inside* a job row River then recorded as `completed` — success on the outside, silent failure
within, and no durable place for the failure to land. Giving each workspace its own row makes the
failure a row: it is retried on its own, counted on its own, and reported on
`GET /v1/admin/job-health` on its own.

---

## 1. `backend/api/jobs.yaml` — the declaration

**Authority is this repo.** Unlike `crm.yaml` and `ai-tasks.yaml`, this file has no upstream
counterpart in the spec and claims none: it declares River *mechanics*, which the spec does not pin.
Where a cadence would restate a spec'd obligation the entry carries `derives-from:` and the chapter
owns the number — no entry carries one today.

Every kind River persists in `river_job.kind` is declared here. Kind strings are **persisted state**:
renaming one strands every live row that carries it, so they are append-only in practice — correct a
Go type name that reads wrong, never the kind.

Five fields are declared for **every** kind:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `role` | `dispatcher` or `worker` — §4. Held to the Go marker interface by a generated assertion |
| `go_type` | the compose args struct that returns this kind (`^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*Args$`). Carried as data, not as an import, so a gate can assert the kind↔type pairing still holds |
| `queue` | must name an entry in the file's own `queues:` block; every non-`default` queue owes a `reason` for having been split out of the default pool |
| `timeout` | the whole-job wall clock — §3. There is **no default** |
| `opts_owner` | who supplies River's insert options — one of three modes, below |

`opts_owner` names *who* decides the queue and attempt cap River inserts a row with:

| Mode | Who owns the options | What the contract does |
|---|---|---|
| `fan_out` | the fan-out helper | **supplied** — the helper reads the declared queue and cap and hands them to River |
| `args` | the args type's own `InsertOpts()` | **checked** — the census compares the declaration against what that method returns |
| `caller` | scattered enqueue sites | **declared only** — the queue in the file is documentation, not a governed value |

Three more are **conditional on what the kind is**, and generation refuses the mismatch in both
directions — a field owed and absent fails, and a field declared where it means nothing fails too:

- **`cadence`** — required on a dispatcher, refused on an enqueued worker (*"an enqueued worker is
  enqueued by its dispatcher, never ticked"*). Exactly one of a duration, `{operator: Field}` naming
  the `JobRunnerConfig` dial the number comes from, or `on_demand`. `on_demand` is a *declaration*,
  not an absence: `embed_reindex` is enqueued by a human's confirm and by no clock, and an absent
  cadence would read as a schedule somebody forgot. An optional `schedule_when_positive: Field` is a
  third posture — the workers stay registered and only the tick goes away.
- **`fans_out_to` + `fan_out_unit`** — one declaration, never one without the other. Required on a
  dispatcher (*"a dispatcher that fans out to nothing … does no work at all"*), refused elsewhere,
  and the named child must itself be `role: worker`. The unit is `workspace`, `connection` or
  `build`, and it is what makes a child row readable: a `gmail_watch_renew_connection` row is one
  *connection's* renewal, not one tenant's. The unit is declared on the **dispatcher**, beside the
  edge it names, because that is where the fan-out decision is made.
- **`max_attempts`** — required for `opts_owner: fan_out` and refused for every other owner, because
  that is the only case the file actually governs: compose's `workspaceSweepOpts` reads this number
  and nothing else does. Publishing a cap the runtime does not honour is exactly the
  declared-versus-actual drift the file exists to remove. Three is the house number and it is small
  on purpose — a fanned-out pass's real retry cadence is the dispatcher's next tick.

And three are declared **by exception**, read that way on purpose — an omission is the strict
posture, never a licence:

- **`registration: {when: [Field, …], absent: registers_nothing | registers_anyway}`** — declared
  only where the kind's wiring depends on something the deployment may not have. `when` is a
  **conjunction** of `JobRunnerConfig` field paths, and an omitted block registers unconditionally.
  The two absence postures are opposites and neither is a default: *registers nothing* means a row
  nothing here could work is never queued at all; *registers anyway* keeps the worker, so a
  picked-up row fails with an actionable message instead of rotting queued. The **same** dependency
  takes different postures on different kinds — `Embedder` registers nothing for the embed drift
  sweep and anyway for a reindex — which is why the posture is per kind and never per field. A
  posture declared with no condition to be absent from fails generation.
- **`fault: {nil_after_logging: …}`** — this worker logs a failure and returns `nil`, and the text is
  the durable retry policy that makes a green River row honest (the connector sidecar's
  `next_sync_at`, a build row's own `deferred` state). Omitted, the worker must return what went
  wrong. A `fault` block with an empty rationale fails generation: *"an unstated waiver is a
  swallowed error with a heading"*.
- **`args: {Field: id | {scalar: true, reason: …} | {reason: …}}`** — §5. An omitted field is not
  waived; the **census** — the fitness test that lays the compiled wiring beside the contract and
  fails on any disagreement (§8) — compares the declaration against the compiled struct.

A kind may also carry a free-form `reason:` stating why its numbers are what they are. Nothing
enforces it, and most non-obvious entries have one.

---

## 2. Generation, and the two halves it writes

`make gen` runs `backend/tools/gen-jobs` over the contract and writes two files that must never be
hand-edited:

- **`internal/platform/jobs/specs_gen.go`** — the `Spec` table. Every reader in the tree walks it:
  the fan-out helpers, the metrics catalogue, the health endpoint, the census.
- **`internal/compose/jobkinds_gen.go`** — the closed union `declaredJobArgs`, the two registration
  functions constrained to it, and one compile-time assertion per kind pairing its args type with its
  declared role.

Both carry the same `sha256` of `api/jobs.yaml`, so a half-regenerated pair is visible without
diffing the two tables (the census checks it: `bothGeneratedHalvesCameFromOneContract`).

The union is a union rather than a marker interface for one reason: **a marker is something a new
type can declare for itself, and the set has to be the file's to state.** An undeclared kind cannot
be named at `addDeclaredWorker`'s call site at all — the failure is `does not satisfy
declaredJobArgs`, on the registration line the author is writing.

---

## 3. Why a worker cannot answer for itself — `jobs.Govern`

River asks a worker four questions: `Work`, `Timeout`, `NextRetry`, `Middleware`. Three of them are
the contract's to answer. A hand-written worker in this tree therefore satisfies only
`jobs.WorkOnly[T]`:

```go
type WorkOnly[T river.JobArgs] interface {
    Work(context.Context, *river.Job[T]) error
}

func Govern[T river.JobArgs](w WorkOnly[T], s Spec, supplied time.Duration) river.Worker[T]
```

`Govern` wraps the worker in a type River reaches **only** through `Work`, so any option method the
worker happens to carry is unreachable. Narrowing the interface is what makes that impossible rather
than merely discouraged — an embedded `WorkerDefaults` override is shadowed by the outer type, which
both a marker interface and a linter rule would have missed.

**The incident this removes.** Before the timeout contract existed, **most kinds ran on River's silent
one-minute default** (at the time, 43 of the 53 that existed — a count from that change's own
analysis, not something today's tree can prove): a worker
that declares no `Timeout` embeds `river.WorkerDefaults`, whose `Timeout` returns zero, and River
reads zero as one minute. The GDPR retention pass shipped that way through five reviews — under a
one-minute cap it would have been cancelled mid-pass nightly and left a permanently failing row for
the one obligation whose whole point is auditability. Nothing was broken enough to notice: a
cancelled job and a job that never had enough time look identical from the outside.

So `timeout` has no default and **absence is not one of its forms**. It takes exactly one of four:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `2m` | a literal wall clock |
| `{derived: c, value: 4h, reason: …}` | computed from a Go constant elsewhere in the tree. `value` is what `Govern` hands River, and the census proves the two still agree — so the declaration tracks the constant instead of freezing a copy. Used only where the constant is read by something other than the census's own lookup table, or the check compares the file against a private copy of itself |
| `{operator: Field}` | computed at registration from a `JobRunnerConfig` dial; not knowable in the file at all (`site_deep_read` is the only one today) |
| `{none: true, reason: …}` | a deliberate absence. `TimeoutPolicy.Duration` yields `-1`, which takes the row out of River's rescuer (its stuck-job reaper) on purpose — the pass is bounded by a backlog rather than a wall clock |

`declaredTimeoutSeconds` never publishes zero on `/metrics`: zero is River's silent minute wearing
the digits of a deliberate absence, and telling those two apart is what the declaration is for. A
deliberate absence is `-1`; an operator-supplied wall clock is reported as *unstated* and its label
is omitted rather than guessed.

Two more gates hold the same line at boot, because neither the union nor `Govern` can see a
hand-edited generated file or a fixture registering into a throwaway `*river.Workers`:

- **`jobs.MustBeTotal`** names every kind this role intends to work that the contract does not
  declare, and `NewJobRunner` refuses to boot. An undeclared kind is *indistinguishable* from the
  default this contract exists to remove, and a process that started anyway would hide it.
- **`everyKindIsRegisteredWithItsDeclaredType`** catches the other half: totality says every kind is
  declared, not that each is worked by the args type its declaration names. An args struct written by
  copying the one beside it and whose `Kind()` still returns the neighbour's string passes totality
  cleanly, runs under the neighbour's timeout, queue and attempt cap, and leaves the kind it was meant
  to serve with no worker. `Spec.GoType` is carried in the compiled table precisely so this can be
  asked.

---

## 4. The two roles

```go
type WorkspaceScoped interface {
    river.JobArgs
    WorkspaceID() ids.UUID
}

type FleetWide interface {
    river.JobArgs
    FleetWide()          // a declaration, not behaviour
}
```

The contract declares **sixty-two** kinds today — twenty-seven dispatchers and thirty-five
workers — and there is no third role. A third would be a change to what a job *is*, not
data: both operational surfaces read `Role` to decide whether a null `args->>'workspace_id'` is
correct or a defect.

**The biconditional.** `role: worker` ⟺ the args type implements `jobs.WorkspaceScoped`, and
`role: dispatcher` ⟺ it implements `jobs.FleetWide`. Generation emits one `var _ jobs.FleetWide =
XArgs{}` / `var _ jobs.WorkspaceScoped = XArgs{}` line per kind, so a *declared* kind's role is the
compiler's to check. Two halves the generated assertions provably cannot reach are gates instead: a
type the contract has never heard of (`TestEveryJobArgsTypeIsDeclaredInTheContract`) and a type that
answers to **both** at once (`TestNoJobArgsDeclaresBothRoles` — *"a job does one workspace's work or
dispatches, never both"*).

**Binding comes from the args' own declaration.** A workspace pass runs under
`compose.workspaceJobCtx`, and nothing else in the tree binds a workspace inside a `Work` body:

```go
func workspaceJobCtx(ctx context.Context, args jobs.WorkspaceScoped) (context.Context, error) {
    ws := args.WorkspaceID()
    if ws == (ids.UUID{}) {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("%s: declares WorkspaceScoped but carries no workspace", args.Kind())
    }
    return principal.WithWorkspaceID(ctx, ws), nil
}
```

It could not live in River middleware: `river.WorkerMiddleware` sees a `rivertype.JobRow` — raw JSON,
never the typed args — so a middleware could only bind by re-reading the wire key, which would leave
the role declaration a label *beside* the binding rather than the thing that governs it. Binding from
`WorkspaceID()` is what keeps the declaration load-bearing: a worker cannot claim one workspace and
work in another.

The **zero id is refused rather than bound**. A zero bound onto the context does not fail here; it
fails at the first statement that narrows by it, somewhere far less legible, and only after the job
has already begun. A zero is
also what an args type decodes to when a queued row predates a change to its wire key, so the refusal
is the difference between a loud failure and a pass that quietly touches nothing.

**No role carries a deferred exception today.** `embed_reindex` is a full pair — a dispatcher whose
fan-out seeds the run's pending set and enqueues its children in one transaction, and an
`embed_reindex_workspace` child that re-embeds one tenant's corpus. Its only unusual properties are
declared ones: `cadence: on_demand` (a human's confirm enqueues it, no clock does) and
`max_attempts: 5` rather than the house three, because with no tick behind it nothing would
re-enqueue a lost workspace until a human confirms again.

**A dispatcher may read; it may not write.** `TestEveryFleetWideJobOnlyDispatches` holds the
`FleetWide` marker to the code: a dispatcher's `Work` must reach one of exactly three fan-out helpers
— `dispatchPerWorkspace`, `dispatchWith` or `dispatchOne` — and must issue no tenant write. That
allowlist is closed, and a direct `river.Insert` is deliberately not in it: those three are where a
child's insert options are built, which is where the `sweep` tag is stamped and the declared queue
and attempt cap are read. A dispatcher inserting around them enqueues a child invisible to both sweep
gauges, carrying whatever numbers its author typed — which is not hypothetical, it is what shipped in
the one dispatcher a hand-maintained comment forgot to list.

**Atomicity is the correctness argument, not a nicety.** `dispatchWith` inserts the whole fan-out as
one `InsertMany`. A per-workspace loop of single inserts that fails partway leaves some children
queued and then fails the dispatcher; by the time it retries, those children may already have
`completed` — and `activeSweepStates` deliberately excludes `completed`, so `ByArgs` uniqueness does
**not** suppress them. The retry would silently re-run those workspaces: a second overlay reconcile
spending incumbent API quota, a second AI-backed capture pass spending model budget. What this does
not buy is exactly-once — River is at-least-once, and the bound on that is the workspace passes
themselves, each re-reading its own backlog.

---

## 5. Args name rows, never carry content

`river_job` has **no workspace column and no RLS**, and River persists `args` verbatim into it. An
args field holding a message body or an address would therefore be a second store of subject data
that Art. 17 erasure never reaches — sitting in a fleet-visible table for as long as River's
retention keeps the row.

The rule is: **a job names a row and the worker reads it.** That is also what makes erasure reach an
in-flight job at all — the engine neutralizes it by scrubbing the row the job names (`comms_outbound`
goes to `parked`, and the waking job finds nothing to send). It only works while the job holds an id
and not a copy.

Three declared shapes, and the difference between them is the whole content of the field:

| Declaration | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Field: id` | a reference to a row — the ordinary case, and the only one that owes nothing |
| `Field: {scalar: true, reason: …}` | the ratified exception: a value that is not an id and could not be one (`Provider: "gmail"`, the embed `Identity` string, a crawl's `MaxPages`). Generation refuses a scalar with no reason |
| `Field: {reason: …}` | an **id** that still owes an argument, because its NAME reads like content (`Body`, `Subject`, `RecipientEmail`) |

That third shape exists because coverage alone is not enough, and the two arms answer different
questions. `TestEveryJobArgsFieldIsAnIdOrAnArguedForScalar` runs both: **coverage** is total over the
fields that actually exist on the compiled struct, inferring nothing from a name — so `Snippet`,
`Note` and `Domain` are under the same rule as `Body`. **Suspicion** matches field names against a
word list and refuses a flagged name with no rationale, because coverage alone would let `Body: id`
through in silence. A word list is a poor detector and a fine prompt: it cannot decide whether a
field is safe, only insist that somebody said so. A reason on a name the list does *not* flag is
stale prose and fails the same gate.

The declared reasons are read as **waivers**, held to the same bar as every other ratified exception
in the tree: a reason that states a cost, and an entry that still describes live code.

---

## 6. The failure vocabulary — `jobs.Fault`

River persists `err.Error()` into `river_job.errors` **verbatim**. That column has no workspace, no
RLS, and a retention River chooses, so whatever a worker returns is stored fleet-visible for as long
as the ladder runs. A provider refusing a message routinely names the address it refused — the raw
cause is the one thing that may not travel this way.

So every worker returns through `jobs.Fault` / `jobs.FaultContext`, which renders a **fixed operator
sentence** chosen by what the cause IS, and keeps the real cause reachable through `errors.Is`:

```go
type fault struct { sentence string; cause error }
func (f *fault) Error() string { return f.sentence }   // fixed
func (f *fault) Unwrap() error { return f.cause }      // still classifies
```

The vocabulary maps the shared sentinel registry (`internal/shared/apperrors`) to fifteen sentences,
each saying what went wrong **and** what it means for the job — an operator reading a failure list
needs to know whether to retry, wait, or fix something (`"the record this job names no longer
exists"`, `"the incumbent CRM's API budget is spent; the poller will catch up"`). An unclassified
cause logs at ERROR with the caller's context and becomes one fixed fallback sentence that says where
the diagnosis went.

Two things pass through **untouched**: `river.JobSnoozeError` and `river.JobCancelError`. A snooze
reschedules and a cancel deliberately stops; neither is a failure and neither carries a cause to
publish. They are checked *before* the vocabulary, so a cancel carrying a known sentinel stays a
cancel — stopping deliberately is not failing. The check cannot live at the call sites: control
returns reach a worker through helpers as often as directly, and every routine provider throttle
would otherwise log as an unclassified failure.

### A transient failure postpones the tick rather than dying

A classified failure still has to answer a second question the class alone does not: does the tick
**fail**, or does it **run again later**? The two are the same Go type and completely different to an
operator — a failure spends the child's attempts and becomes dead work on the Maintenance screen,
while a postponement reschedules the same row and shows nobody anything.

A composed unit cannot return `river.JobSnooze` itself: it is a separate module that may import only
the allowlisted `pkg/extension` surface. So it asks, with the same declared class it would have failed
under:

```go
// An unreachable provider needs nobody, so the tick runs again instead of dying.
return extension.Reschedule(classProviderUnavailable, pollRetryDelay, cause)
```

`jobs.FaultForKind` honours the request only when the class is one this installation **registered for
the failing kind** — the same rule the sentence is held to, so declaring a class is what buys both
halves — and clamps the delay to `[1s, 15m]` before it reaches the queue. The floor is not cosmetic:
River *panics* on a negative duration, so a unit that computed one from a clock would take the worker
process down rather than fail a tick. The ceiling is about the AGE reading rather than about visibility: a
`scheduled` row is counted as waiting by both readers, but every "how long has this waited"
measurement filters `scheduled_at <= now()` — correctly, since nothing scheduled for the future is
late — so a far-future delay produces a count nobody can age, forever, next to counts a healthy idle
tick produces too. The ceiling keeps a stuck postponement inside the window where it eventually
becomes measurable. A clamped request logs what it asked for alongside what it got, or the bound
would catch the mistake and say nothing about it. A postponement logs at
WARN with the cause and the delay, because River records no attempt error for a snooze and that line
plus the unit's own row are the entire trail.

Both shipped connectors ask for their **dispatcher's own cadence** (120s), and the match is the
design. A postponed child sits in `scheduled`, one of the states the fan-out's uniqueness window
covers, so while it waits the dispatcher's next insert for that workspace collapses into it — the
postponement *replaces* the tick it would have raced. Said exactly: the delay runs from the *failure*
rather than from the schedule, so during an outage the effective interval is the cadence plus however
long a tick spends discovering it cannot reach anybody — strictly slower than health, never faster,
which is the safe direction against a retention window measured in days.

It is deliberately **not a backoff**, and that is a decision about loss rather than about politeness.
For these connectors poll liveness is a *data-integrity* concern rather than a freshness one — Zalo
drops messages from its API after roughly nine days with no webhook and no depth to page back to — so
polling less during an outage widens the window a connector can permanently fall behind by, in
exchange for saving one request every two minutes against a host that is already refusing. A ladder
is buildable if a later unit wants one: River keeps a snooze count in the job's own metadata, and the
job's attempt counter is not it (a snooze *decrements* attempt, by design, so snoozes never exhaust
retries). What stops a backoff here is the direction, not the absence of a counter.

The **throttle** arm is the one case where "the provider is refusing anyway" is not the argument:
`errTransient` covers a 429, and a 429 is a reachable provider asking for less traffic. What makes the
same delay right there is that it is the *healthy* cadence — a throttled tick postponing to 120s puts
no more load on the provider than a successful one does, and it is strictly gentler than the behaviour
it replaces, where River's ladder retried within seconds and then discarded the row. Neither connector
reads `Retry-After`, so a provider naming a longer wait is answered on our clock
([#1809](https://github.com/margince/margince/issues/1809)); `capture/telegram` already
honours the interval Telegram names, and is the pattern to follow.

**Only a failure that needs nobody may postpone itself.** A refused credential, a lapsed service
package, an unregistered API group and an answer the connector cannot read all still become dead work,
because each of them needs a human. A postponed outage is named on the connector's own settings screen
instead, which is where `last_error_class` has always been rendered — the row write is unchanged, and
a postponement that skipped it would turn a noisy outage into a silent one.

**`river_job.errors` is never shown to a human raw.** `jobs.Failure.StoredReason` carries the column
verbatim and the caller must vet it with `jobs.VettedSentence(s)` before putting it on a wire: a
worker that bypassed `Fault` stored its raw cause there, and River writes into the column too (its
rescuer's `"Stuck job rescued by JobRescuer"` is not a `Fault` sentence and is correctly refused). The
comparison is **exact**, never a prefix or a contains — a raw cause that merely embeds a vetted
sentence would otherwise carry the rest of its text through on the strength of the part that matched.
The vocabulary itself stays unexported: a caller asks whether one string is vetted, it does not get
the list to render or match against by hand.

## 7. Reading the fleet

Two readers over one table, answering two different questions — `/metrics` (is a queue growing?) and
`GET /v1/admin/job-health` (whose work died, and why?). Both live in `internal/platform/jobs`
(`stats.go`, `health.go`) rather than in compose, because `river_job` has no RLS: **every statement
over it is a hand-imposed scope**, and two readers spelling that scope in two packages is how the
operational and the admin surface drift into different answers about one table.

The gauge families, their labels, the sweep-coverage pairs, the declaration-derived catalogue, and
the eight caveats that apply when you read a kind's rows are documented once, for operators, in
[reference/configuration.md → Reading the job surfaces](../reference/configuration.md#reading-the-job-surfaces).
They are not repeated here.

The one structural point worth restating: the scope `health.go` imposes admits the caller's own
workspace rows plus the untenanted rows of the **caller's declared dispatcher kinds** — closed
against that list rather than admitting every null. "The workspace key is null" is a property held by
source-shape tests, not by a database constraint, and the app role holds direct CRUD on an
RLS-less table; a malformed or externally inserted row would otherwise land in a global arm and carry
its kind, counts and failure class to every workspace's admin.

## 8. What holds it — the fitness tests

Eleven gates under `backend/gates/`, all in package `gates`, all part of `make check`. Every
gate that walks the tree carries a **floor** — a minimum number of things it must have inspected —
because most of them are prohibitions, and a walker that silently matched nothing would otherwise
read green. (The census carries its own, `declaredJobKindFloor`, beside the assembly it reads.)

| File | What it catches |
|---|---|
| `jobrole_test.go` | a River job args type (it declares `Kind()`) that `api/jobs.yaml` has never heard of; and a type declaring `WorkspaceID()` **and** `FleetWide()` at once |
| `jobwirekey_test.go` | a workspace key spelled anything but `json:"workspace_id"`, of any type but `ids.UUID`, absent, embedded, or duplicated at one depth — and, the other direction, a **dispatcher** shipping a workspace key at all. Both failures look exactly like the reassuring answer to `args->>'workspace_id'` |
| `jobbinding_test.go` | a `Work` body that binds its own workspace inline instead of through `workspaceJobCtx` — which could declare one field and bind another, with the role gate still green |
| `jobfleetwide_test.go` | a `FleetWide` dispatcher that never fans out, that fans out around the three chokepoints, that issues a tenant write, or that no worker runs at all |
| `jobfleetwideshapes_test.go` | the gate above, falsified: every dispatch shape the tree actually uses proven **accepted**, and the two shapes it exists to reject proven rejected. A gate that blocks a legitimate author gets weakened by the person it stopped |
| `jobfleetscan_test.go` | a `FROM workspace` collection read outside the ratified sites, each of which must name which of four things it is (a dispatcher's enumeration, a pure read, a boot path, or tenant resolution for an untenanted inbound request) |
| `jobfault_test.go` | a `Work` return, or an assignment to a named error result, that is not `nil`, `jobs.Fault(…)` or a River control return — plus a worker that logs an error and returns `nil` without a ratified `fault:` waiver |
| `jobargscontent_test.go` | an args field the contract does not declare, a scalar with no rationale, and a content-sounding field name declared `id` with nothing said about it |
| `jobkindgate_test.go` | the registration gate falsified — the three legitimate authoring shapes compile, an undeclared kind does not, and a worker registered under the wrong kind is named. The second half puts the undeclared registration in front of the **real** generated union, not a miniature of it |
| `jobregistrationban_test.go` | the forbidigo rules that ban a direct River registration and a runtime schedule mutation — held to River's own API rather than to a remembered list of spellings. Every exported function in package `river` whose first parameter is `*Workers` is derived as an entry point, so a fourth spelling in a future upgrade enrols itself |
| `jobcensus_test.go` | everything the others cannot see, by building a real (client-less) runner assembly and laying it beside the contract: a kind declared and never wired, a `{derived: …}` timeout whose Go constant moved, an args field nobody declared, a fan-out child not writing its unit key, an args-owned kind inserting on the wrong queue, one args type answering to a second kind, and a declared queue whose bound compose does not build |

The census is the only gate that holds **both** ends of the contract at once. Every other one holds a
single end: the union stops an undeclared kind compiling, `MustBeTotal` refuses a boot that got one in
anyway, `Govern` makes the declared timeout the one River applies — none of them can see a kind that
was declared and never wired.

## Rules of thumb

- **A kind is declared before it is written.** Not in the file ⇒ does not compile ⇒ cannot boot.
- **A worker exposes `Work` and nothing else.** Timeout, retry policy and middleware belong to the
  declaration.
- **A dispatcher enumerates and enqueues; a workspace job does the work and owns its failure.** If a
  `Work` body loops the fleet, it is the shape this whole layer removed.
- **A fan-out goes through `dispatchPerWorkspace` / `dispatchWith` / `dispatchOne`** — never a direct
  River insert, or the child loses the sweep tag and its declared cap.
- **Args carry ids.** A scalar is a ratified exception with a written reason.
- **Return the failure through `jobs.FaultContext`**, and vet anything read back out of
  `river_job.errors` before showing it to a human.
- **A null `args->>'workspace_id'` means a dispatcher and nothing else** — every read of the job table
  is built on that, in both directions.
