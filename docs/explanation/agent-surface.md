# The agent surface & the model runtime

How AI agents *act* inside Margince, and what *runs the model* behind them. This is the read/react
counterpart to the write path: how a proposal becomes a governed action. The **governance** — the
autonomy tiers, passports, and the one admission gate — is explained in
[authorization.md](authorization.md); this page is what the agent *does* and how the model runtime is
wired.

## Two surfaces, one gate

There are two ways an agent reaches the tool surface, and **both go through the same governed
registry and the same admission gate** — there is no privileged back door:

- **Surface A** — an *external* agent over MCP (`/mcp`, Streamable HTTP on the api), acting under a passport.
- **Surface B** — *our own* runner: the proactive reason-act-observe loop (e.g. the overnight passes).

Both call every action through `agents.Registry.Invoke`, which admits each call through `platform/auth`
(**scope ∧ seat ∧ tier**) before any handler runs. A 🟢 call executes and is audited; a 🟡 call stages a
confirm-first approval. "Two surfaces, one gate" is a property of the construction, not a convention.

Most consequential verbs are 🟢 (ADR-0055). A passport carries the granting human's own seat, grants and
row scope, so a send or an archive it can spend is one that person could spend unaided in the app, and
asking them to confirm it again made the agent surface weaker than the person behind it rather than
safer. What still bounds a call is what bounds the human: RBAC, row scope, the seat ceiling, expiry, and
the scope its holder chose to lend. 🟡 is kept for calls whose destination the credential-holder did not
choose — `enrich` is the standing case, because the model names the URL the server fetches. An
installation that wants a particular verb confirmed **floors** it back per record type, and every verb
still carries the staging machinery that makes the floor land in a human's inbox.

## The reason-act-observe loop (Surface B)

The runner (`internal/modules/agents/runner/`) is where **the model proposes and the governed tool
surface decides**. Each iteration:

1. **Guarantee checks first** — three hard per-run ceilings: wall-clock, a **step budget**
   (`MaxSteps`, default 40), and an **output-token budget** (`MaxOutputTokens`, default 50 000).
   Hitting one degrades the run honestly, so one unattended run can never claim the whole workspace's
   model budget.
2. **Reason** — one model call (`brain.Complete`).
3. **Parse** the proposed step — the protocol requires *exactly one* of `tool` or `final`; malformed
   output retries with feedback, and after 3 consecutive invalid steps the run **degrades honestly**
   rather than fabricate a partial result.
4. **Terminal** — a `final` step completes the run.
5. **Act** — `registry.Invoke(tool, args)` (the runner's *only* path to an action).
6. **Observe** — on the tool's result:
   - a **🟡 refusal** *suspends* the run on the staged approval (`awaiting_approval`) — it never blocks;
   - a **scope/budget refusal** is fed back as an *observation*, so the model re-plans within its
     authority;
   - **success** is observed and the loop continues.

**Resume:** when a human approves, the run re-submits the *identical* staged call carrying the approval
id; when rejected, it observes "re-plan without it." **Grounding** content seeded into the run is
spotlighted as *data, not instructions* (a prompt-injection guard). The runner reaches records **only
through the registry** — read-vs-write is governed by the gate, never by the loop itself.

## The model runtime

Behind the `ports/model` seam (`Client { Complete / Stream / Embed / Caps }`), **model choice is config,
not architecture**. `internal/modules/ai/` owns it:

- **`SelectBrain(cfg)`** turns one binding (the `ai.routing` setting) into a `Client` — "offline fake ↔
  API key ↔ local, one line." Providers:
  - **`anthropic`**, **`openai`**, **`gemini`** (the shipped cloud default), and **`openai_compatible`**
    (any vendor speaking the OpenAI wire shape, `base_url`-bound) — cloud **BYOK**: you supply the
    key, the product runs no inference of its own.
  - **`ollama`** and **`vllm`** — local / self-host adapters (`LocalOnly`, eligible for the zero-egress
    sovereign profile).
  - **`fake`** — a fully deterministic offline client that every test drives (records each outbound
    payload *after* stripping, so tests assert what would have left the process).
- **The Router** — tasks name *tiers*; tiers resolve to bound clients; the budget guardrail bends the
  route *before* the call; every call is metered. **Callers never pick a model.**
- **The `SecretStripper`** runs over *every* outbound payload and irreversibly removes secrets — API
  keys, tokens, private keys, password assignments (→ `[SECRET-REMOVED:<kind>]`). It is **hygiene, not
  a PII filter**: names, emails, and phone numbers pass through (privacy is handled by the location
  ladder and the erasure engines, not by stripping). The sovereign profile blocks egress entirely.
  It is also a **text-lane** guarantee: an attachment rides the payload base64-encoded, and the rules
  match a secret's literal text, so a credential *inside an attached file* is not there for them to
  find — while the same file arriving as text is scrubbed. Attaching a document is a decision to send
  its bytes as they are.
- **Metering & budget** — `ai_usage` accumulates per-(workspace, day, task, tier) counters against a
  **workspace monthly token budget** (distinct from the per-run step/output-token ceilings above,
  which stop a single runaway run). At ≥80% utilization the router soft-degrades a tier; at ≥100%
  **background** tasks are deferred with a typed `BudgetDeferralError` (unwraps to
  `ErrBudgetDeferred`, carries `NextAttemptAt` — the next budget window) before any provider attempt
  or trace row, while **interactive** tasks degrade to `local_small` rather than block a user
  mid-flow. **Core CRM is never behind this error — only model calls are.**

## Automations & MCP transports (in brief)

- **Automations** (`/v1/automations`) parameterize the workflow engine's closed catalog per workspace;
  mutations are human-only, re-gated at the store on the `automation` RBAC object. (The workflow engine
  itself is covered in [write-backbone.md → who consumes the events](write-backbone.md#5-the-consumer-side--groups--dedupe).)
- **MCP** serves the tool surface at `/mcp` on the api — one registry, one admission gate, one audit
  stream, one transport (the A1 stdio server and its `cmd/mcp` binary are retired, SCR-9).
  `tools/list` is filtered on the **scope axis** per caller, so the list reflects the passport's
  scopes — not a promise that every listed tool will run. The seat ceiling and object RBAC are
  re-derived at each invoke, so a listed tool can still be refused by those.
  The catalog itself: [reference/agent-tools.md](../reference/agent-tools.md).
  Connecting: [how-to/connect-an-mcp-client.md](../how-to/connect-an-mcp-client.md);
  minting the passport: [how-to/mint-a-passport.md](../how-to/mint-a-passport.md).

## Honest gaps

- **The per-agent volume budget is specified but not yet enforced.** The admission gate binds scope ∧ seat ∧ tier
  today; a per-agent budget ceiling is designed but not wired.

## Where to go next

- The gate, autonomy tiers, and what a passport is: [authorization.md](authorization.md).
- Where the runner's resume trigger comes from (the `approval.decided` event):
  [write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md).
- What each module owns (`agents`, `ai`): [reference/modules.md](../reference/modules.md).

## What a passport is worth

Connecting a client is one command and the how-to owns it:
[connect-an-mcp-client.md](../how-to/connect-an-mcp-client.md). Two consequences
of that arrangement are worth stating here, because both are easy to assume
otherwise:

- **A passport is a REST Bearer credential too, governed exactly as it is over
  MCP** (ADR-0055, superseding the older "read-only on REST" rule). 🟢 mutations
  auto-execute; 🟡 ones stage for confirm-first approval; both stay capped by the
  granting human's live seat and RBAC. There is no quieter path to the same data.
- **Every call re-authenticates**, so revocation binds mid-session rather than at
  the next login. A passport taken away stops working on the next tool call.
