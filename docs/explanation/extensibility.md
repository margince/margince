# Extensibility — the extension tier

How a bounded add-on lands in this product **without editing a single upstream-owned file — with one
recorded exception, below**. This is
the *extension tier*: one named, versioned unit under `extensions/<name>/`, its own Go module,
reaching the core through one narrow published surface and composed in at build time. The vanilla tree
already ships two:

| Unit | What it is |
|---|---|
| `extensions/de` | The German jurisdiction pack — statutory retention floors, and nothing else |
| `extensions/openchannel` | The reference unit, and it exercises every capability the tier has: its own tables, seven governed agent tools, an anonymous signed inbound edge, a drain job, a subscription, ingress with a merge key, a transport it carries replies out on, and its own screen |

This page is for a contributor who wants the whole idea first, then the detail. Start here; to

## The whole idea in one picture

```text
extensions/<name>/                 one Go module per unit — its PRESENCE is the enablement
   │  New() extension.Extension     an inert declaration: plain data, no handle into the core

   ▼
core consumes the capability        e.g. the retention engine reads a jurisdiction pack's floors
```

Read top to bottom, that is the entire lifecycle: a unit *declares* a value, the generator *composes*
the enabled set, the build *binds* one composition module, each role binary *reconciles* it into the
core at boot, and the core *consumes* it. Everything below is detail on one of those five steps.

## Purpose — why a whole tier for this

Some behaviour is real but doesn't belong in everyone's build: a country's statutory retention rules,
a customer-specific add-on. The tier exists so that behaviour can be **added, versioned, and reasoned
about as its own unit** without forking the core or touching upstream files — and without giving up
the guarantee that the composed product is wired exactly like the core.

**The rejected alternative names the design.** The obvious way to ship this is a runtime plugin — a
`.so` loaded at startup, an RPC sidecar, a hook registry a unit mutates in `init()`. All three are
refused for one reason: they introduce an authority the compiler cannot check — a dynamically loaded
or separately deployed unit whose reach into the product nothing in the build proves. An extension
here is a **compile-time unit** instead. Its module path sits *outside* the backend module, so the
compiler itself makes `internal/**` unreachable — the unit *cannot* import into the core even if it
tries — and fitness tests hold the rest of the surface. This is an **import/API boundary, not a
sandbox**: a unit's `New()` and its capability methods still run as ordinary trusted Go in the role
process. Paying for extensibility with a rebuild is the trade: a composed product is provably wired the
same way the core is, or the build fails.

## Principles

Four rules hold the whole tier together:

1. **Presence is enablement.** A unit is enabled because a directory for it exists under
   `extensions/`. No flag, no config list, no registry file to append to. The enabled set is a *fact
   about the tree*, not a value someone can forget to update.
2. **A declaration is inert data.** `New()` returns a plain value holding no handle into the running
   server. It registers nothing itself; only the boot reconciliation, after the whole set validated,
   applies anything. Nothing is wired *through the declaration*, so a unit cannot reach the core or
   another unit that way — an import/API boundary, not a runtime sandbox.
3. **Grow additively, never in place.** Capabilities are *fields* on the declaration. A new kind of
   capability is a new field; a changed contract is a versioned successor, never an edited signature.
   Existing units keep compiling untouched.
4. **One narrow backend surface, and it's enforced.** A unit reaches the backend *only* through the
   marker-allowlisted `backend/pkg/**` packages; the gate also rejects the composition module and
   sibling units. Its other dependencies (stdlib, third-party) are its own business. Fitness tests,
   not good intentions, hold this.

## The parts

Five moving pieces, matching the five steps in the picture.

### 1. The declaration — what a unit exports

A unit exports one function returning one value:

```go
func New() extension.Extension {
	return extension.Extension{
		Name:          "de",
		Version:       "1.0.0",
		Jurisdictions: []jurisdiction.Pack{pack{}},
	}
}
```

That value is the entire contract. `Name` is the canonical unit name (it must equal the directory
name, obeys `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, ≤32 chars) and keys the unit's namespace everywhere it will
touch — `ext_<name>_<table>` tables, `/v1/ext/<name>/` paths, the `ext_<name>` database role. `Version` is
recorded in the boot inventory and carries no authority.

**Capabilities are the remaining fields**, and each is its own field precisely so that adding one
breaks no existing unit:

| Field | What it contributes |
|---|---|
| `Jurisdictions` | Passive policy the core consults. Never an actor, so it appears in no manifest |
| `Tools` | Governed agent tools: a risk-tier request in the manifest, and — when the declaration carries a handler — a tool the agent surface serves (§5) |
| `Channels` | Messaging providers the unit supplies **transport** for. The core calls the unit to send; the unit never sends on its own authority |
| `Ingress` | Providers the unit brings records **in** from, and the identity keys that source vouches for |
| `Subscriptions` | Event types the unit reacts to, each with the function one delivery runs |
| `Jobs` | Scheduled work: a cadenced fan-out with a worker child per tenant |
| `Secrets` | The secret keys the unit will use, by name and scope. A request, not a grant |
| `Migrations` | The unit's own SQL schema layer, embedded rather than read from the tree |

`Channels` and `Ingress` are deliberately separate. Neither implies the other: a unit may capture
from a provider it cannot send on, and the channel declaration is what says which.

### 2. The published surface — and the marker that gates it

A unit may import only `backend/pkg/**`, and only the packages that opt in. Three exist today:

- **`pkg/extension`** — the declaration types (`Extension`, the self-validating `Name`/`Version`) and
  every capability contract that rides on them: `Tool`, `Channel`, `IngressSource` and `Record`,
  `MergeKey`, `Subscription`, `Job`, `SecretsRequest`, and the per-invocation `Runtime`. It also
  carries the file types a unit and a core connector must share — `InboundFile`, `FileDrop`,
  `OutboundFile`, the four `MaxInbound*` bounds, and the `SniffContentType`/`SafeFilename` pair every
  producer of an inbound file calls — so what a file is, what it is called and how large it may be
  are decided once rather than per producer. One package across several files; the marker is
  per-package, not per-file.
- **`pkg/extension/jurisdiction`** — the jurisdiction-pack contract (`Pack`, `Retention`,
  `RetentionClass`, the closed class/anchor vocabularies, the calendar `Period`).
- **`pkg/extension/crm`** — the shapes a unit passes to and receives from `tx.Core()`, the governed
  door onto core records.

Membership in `backend/pkg` **grants nothing on its own**. A package is extension surface only when
its package clause carries the directive `//margince:extension-surface`. The allowlist is *derived
from the tree* — a fitness test walks `pkg/`, collects every marked package, and treats exactly that
set as importable — so the published API can never drift from what the gate enforces. The constrained
**primitive types** on the surface self-validate (`Name.Validate`, `Period.Validate`,
`RetentionClassName.Validate`, …) with the same checks boot reconciliation runs, so an author who
tests against them catches a malformed field at test time. There is no aggregate `Extension.Validate`,
though: whole-declaration and cross-unit checks (a duplicate name, a code a core pack already holds)
still first run at boot.

### 3. The composition build — `gen-composition`

The core never imports an extension module. Instead `tools/gen-composition` (run by
`make composition`, on which every build and test lane depends) scans `extensions/` and materializes
`build/composition/` — the one ignored root for installation-dependent output: the composed `go.work`,
a **composition Go module** whose generated `Extensions()` returns the enabled set, and a manifest
binding input digests to reproducible output hashes. With an *empty* `extensions/` tree the generator
reproduces the committed `composition/` stub **byte-identically**, so a bare `go build` and a composed
build provably wire the same thing. `make check-composition` is the drift gate that proves it.

The generator also derives each unit's **`manifest.generated.json`** next to the unit:
its identity and the **risk tiers** it requests — every operation the extension adds that runs
at a 🟢/🟡 tier or asks for a scope, the things an operator must resolve under §7 — read STATICALLY
from the declaration's AST, so review tooling and the coming approval flow learn what a unit needs
without compiling or executing its code. The first governed kind is the **agent tool**
(`extension.Tool`: a verb, a requested tier, one requested scope); a tool declaration derives into one
risk-tier request carrying the §5 security descriptor (id, operation, scopes, tier) and its
digest. Declaring a tool records the request in the manifest; whether it is also *served* depends on
the declaration carrying a handler (§5). Passive policy
that an extension merely supplies requests no risk tier and does not appear: a jurisdiction pack exposes no
governed operation (the core consults its policy at boot — it is never an agent that acts) and asks
for no tier, so a jurisdiction-only unit (like `de`) carries an empty risk-tiers list — there is
nothing to approve.

Beyond the risk tiers, the manifest records what a unit **reaches**, so an operator can read its
blast radius before enabling it:

| Manifest key | From | Says |
|---|---|---|
| `risk_tiers` | `Tools`, `Jobs`, contract fragments | Every governed operation, its tier and its scopes |
| `secrets` | `Secrets` | Which keys the unit expects, and at which scope |
| `subscriptions` | `Subscriptions` | Which of the installation's facts it consumes |
| `ingress` | `Ingress` | Which providers it lands records from, which kinds, and which identity keys the source **vouches for** (`merges`) |
| `channels` | `Channels` | Which providers it supplies, and whether it supplies a **transport** (`supplies_transport`) or captures only |

The returned `extension.Extension` literal and every field the manifest derives must be literal
values; an unrecognized field fails generation with its position rather than producing a manifest
that silently omits a request. That is why a unit spells `"relay"` twice rather than sharing a
constant between its ingress source and its channel — the reader is static and resolves no
constants, and a test holds the two strings equal. The manifest is committed with the unit and
drift-gated like the contract; its digest rides in `composition.json` per unit.

### 4. The build-time binding — which `composition` module the compiler links

The generator writes the composed wiring, but nothing yet says the *binary* should use it. That is a
separate step, and it is worth understanding on its own: the composition module exists **twice on
disk under one import path**.

| | Module path | `Extensions()` returns |
|---|---|---|
| `composition/` — committed vanilla stub | `github.com/margince/margince/composition` | `nil` |
| `build/composition/backend/` — generated, git-ignored | `github.com/margince/margince/composition` | the enabled set |

Core code carries one unconditional `composition.Extensions()` call — no build tags, no `if enabled`.
**Which function body that call links to is decided by the active Go workspace**, through two
resolution mechanisms whose precedence is the whole trick:

- **`replace` in `backend/go.mod`** points the import path at `../composition`, the stub. It is
  committed, so it is what a bare `go build` — or `gopls` in an editor — resolves. That is deliberate:
  tooling always sees vanilla.
- **`use` in the generated `build/composition/go.work`** lists the generated module's directory. A
  `use` entry does not substitute one path for another; it declares that directory as the local source
  for whatever module path its own `go.mod` names. **A workspace member outranks a member module's
  `replace`**, so inside this workspace the generated module wins and the `replace` is never reached.

Hence the switch in `backend/Makefile`, which every build, test, and run lane carries:

```make
COMPOSITION_DIR := $(abspath ../build/composition)
GOWORK_COMPOSED := GOWORK=$(COMPOSITION_DIR)/go.work
```

Two consequences worth internalizing. First, `gen-composition` itself runs under the **root**
`go.work` instead: it lives in the separate `backend/tools` module and must resolve *before* the
composition exists, so it cannot depend on a workspace that its own output creates. Second, a lane
that forgets to export `GOWORK` does not fail — it silently produces a **vanilla** binary that boots
fine and looks identical. The byte-identity gate is what makes that safe rather than alarming for the
empty set, but for a non-empty `extensions/` tree it is a real failure mode: check `GOWORK` before
concluding an extension "did not load".

The confusing part when reading the tree is that the generated module sits in a directory named
`backend/` while declaring the `composition` module path. Go only ever reads the `module` line; the
directory name is a sibling-of-outputs convention (`build/composition/` also holds `api/` and
`frontend/`), never a Go-meaningful name.

### 5. The boot reconciliation — validate the set, then apply

Each role binary wires the composed set at exactly one place — its `main.go`:

```go
extensions := composition.Extensions()
if err := compose.RegisterExtensions(extensions); err != nil { … }
```

`RegisterExtensions` runs **two separated phases**, and the separation is the invariant. First it
*validates the whole set* — every name, version, and capability, checked against both the declared set
and the live core registries (a duplicate name, a jurisdiction code a core pack already holds, a
retention class outside the closed vocabulary — any of these aborts the boot *before anything
applies*). Only once the set is known good does it *apply* — registering each capability into its core
registry. Why two phases: register-as-you-go could fail halfway and leave a half-composed server.
Validate-then-apply makes "partially registered extension" a state the system cannot reach.

## What an extension can do today — and how that grows

**The kinds, and which of them an operator resolves.** A **jurisdiction pack** supplies
*country-specific policy the core consults; it is never an actor* — it exposes no governed operation,
so it never appears in the unit manifest. A **scheduled job** and a **subscription** are the two that
run with nobody behind them; a subscription's manifest entry records its REACH (which event types it
consumes) rather than a tier, because there is nothing about a listener for an operator to resolve. An
**ingress source** and a **channel** are the two that face outward, and their manifest entries record
reach as well — which provider, which record kinds, which identity keys, and whether the unit can also
send. Neither runs on its own authority: an ingest runs as the member whose credential produced the
record, and a send happens only because a human staged one. An
**agent tool** (`extension.Tool`) is the *governed* kind proper: it derives a risk-tier
request into `manifest.generated.json` for operator resolution (§7), and a tool declaring a `Handle`
**is served** — `buildExtensionTools` adapts it to the core `mcp.Tool` seam and boot registers it into
the same `agents.Registry`, admission gate, and tool listing the core tools ride (`extensions/openchannel`
is the reference unit that exercises that path end to end). Two limits hold there: a handler-less
declaration stays a manifest request and serves nothing, and a *served* 🟡 confirm-first tool is
refused at boot rather than registered, because this data-only adapter cannot implement the registry's
staging seam — its approvals could never be staged, so the capability would be dead on every call. A
served tool spending an outbound `send`/`enrich` cap is refused for the same reason read from the other
end: it could only ever run 🟢, and every core verb that leaves the workspace is confirm-first, so
serving one would be outbound authority with nobody to ask. That binds the DECLARATION — a handler is
ordinary Go and could reach the network whatever cap it asks for; what the refusal buys is that a unit
cannot ASK for outbound authority and be granted it silently. And
until per-capability operator resolution lands, **the composed set is itself the trust boundary**: a
handler-bearing tool is served at its declared tier because someone added the unit to the tree
deliberately.

`Title` is the one field on the declaration that grants nothing: it is what `tools/list` DISPLAYS in
place of the verb. Optional, and kept out of the manifest's governance descriptor and its digest — but
validated at gen time all the same, because the core registry refuses a blank display name and would
otherwise do it by panicking the boot that composed the unit.

The core stays country-neutral — a fitness gate
(`check-no-jurisdiction.sh`) scans hand-written core source for jurisdiction-specific identifiers and
fails the build on a match. Germany does not live in the core; it lives in `extensions/de`, which
declares the GoBD/AO statutory **retention floors** — commercial correspondence 6 years, and
accounting vouchers (*Buchungsbelege* — §147 AO's 8-year class as amended 2025; the 10-year
books-and-records class is deliberately absent, since a CRM holds no such record) — each anchored at
calendar-year end, because §147(4) AO counts every period from the end of the record's calendar year.
The engine treats a floor as a *minimum*: a workspace may keep longer, never destroy earlier. Today
only the correspondence floor actually binds a record; the accounting-vouchers class is declared but
**inert**, because no in-product invoice yet derives into it. The seam re-exports the pack types as
aliases, so the core retention engine consults the *same* constants an extension declares.

**How new capabilities arrive.** A new capability kind is a new *field* on `extension.Extension` and a
new marked `pkg/**` package holding its contract — existing units keep compiling. The unit name is
validated to the full identifier budget, so a name chosen today stays valid for every surface.

**What a unit can own today.** All of the following have landed:

- **Its own tables** — `ext.ext_<name>_*`, from a `migrations/` directory of `NNNN_name.up.sql`/`.down.sql`
  pairs the unit embeds and `cmd/migrate` applies as its own namespace, tracked in
  `schema_migrations_ext_<name>`. A unit table must carry no workspace column, no row-level security
  and no policy — the tenant they would key on is gone; `make check-ext-migrations` applies the
  unit's migrations as a *minted restricted role* against a throwaway database and re-reads the catalog
  to prove it. At runtime there is no such role — `cmd/migrate` runs one owner connection with no
  `SET ROLE`, and every unit shares the one app role in production, so isolation between units' own
  tables rests on the AST-level SQL-scope gate (`extensionsqlscope_test.go`), not on a database
  privilege boundary (#628).
- **Its own HTTP surface** — `/v1/ext/<name>/…`, declared as operations in an `api/` contract fragment
  that is merged into the composed `crm.yaml`. `build/composition/api/crm.yaml` is a real merge now, not
  a byte-copy of the core contract.
- **Its own governed tools** — an `x-mcp-tool` verb on a declared operation, served through the same
  admission gate a core tool passes, at the tier and scope the contract declares.
- **Its own scheduled jobs** — declared in a `jobs.yaml` fragment, dispatched as a fleet fan-out with a
  worker child per live tenant.
- **Its own secret namespace** — reached through `Runtime.Secrets()`, keyed by the unit's own bare names.
- **Its own RBAC objects** — `ext_<name>_*`, registered into the vocabulary `/me` serves.
- **Its own history and its own events** — `tx.Record(ctx, change, event)` writes the ledger row AND
  the outbox event for a write to the unit's own tables, in the caller's transaction. One call, both
  halves, always: it is the product's own write shape (domain row + audit row + outbox event, one
  transaction) offered to a unit in a form that cannot be half-used — an event with no ledger row is
  unauditable, and a ledger row with no event is a change nothing downstream is told about, which the
  core grants itself no exemption from either. It is OFFERED rather than enforced: the three SQL
  verbs still write whatever a unit tells them to, and a write made through `Exec` alone records
  nothing, which is a choice a unit makes. The type on the bus is `ext_<namespace>.<verb>` — the
  core prefixes the namespace from the invocation, so a unit can publish neither under another unit's
  name nor inside a core family — and every extension event rides one stream,
  `gw:events:crm:extension`, which no core consumer group carries.
- **Its own reactions** — a `Subscription` names the event types the unit listens for (a core type or
  another unit's) and the function one delivery runs. Each gets its own consumer group,
  `cg:ext-<unit>-<subscription>`, started in the worker role. A delivery has **nobody** behind it: the
  caller is the zero `Caller` and `tx.Core()` refuses, while the unit's own tables stay writable,
  auditable and publishable. The declared type list derives into `manifest.generated.json`, so which
  of the installation's facts a unit consumes is readable without opening its source.

- **Its own ingress into the product's records** — `Runtime.Ingest(ctx, on, record)` hands ONE record a
  unit pulled from its provider to the installation's own capture pipeline, so a unit's captured message
  gets exactly what a captured mail gets: an idempotent write on `(source_system, source_id)`, the
  counterparty disposition ladder, the provider's original kept as evidence, and the audit row and the
  outbox event committed with the row. The unit assembles no timeline entry and could not: it hands over
  a record and the core decides what becomes of it.

  It hangs off `Runtime` rather than `Tx`, inverting the core port's placement, because the pipeline
  opens its own transaction — calling it from inside a unit's would take a second connection while
  holding one, which on a small pool does not fail but hangs (`ErrNestedIngest` makes it a sentence).
  The provenance is core-stamped from the unit and the source it DECLARED (`Ingress`, which derives into
  `manifest.generated.json`), so a unit can attribute nothing to another unit or to a core connector, and
  a landed row's `captured_by` names the member behind it as well.

  A source also declares the **identity keys it vouches for** (`Merges`, empty by default). A unit
  supplies every field its provider gives it and decides nothing about identity; which of those fields
  the core's resolution ladder may match on is read from the declaration. Concretely: a direct message
  names its human by a channel account, and an address riding alongside it may be matched on only if
  the source declared `MergeKeyEmail` — which is what lets a colleague already captured from mail be
  recognised instead of becoming a second contact. See
  [ingress-gate-and-auto-capture.md](ingress-gate-and-auto-capture.md).

  Authority is the mirror image of `tx.Core()`'s: an ingest is refused from an ATTENDED invocation, and
  it runs on the LIVE authority of the member named in `on` — who must currently hold one of this unit's
  user-scoped secrets, because depositing a credential with a unit is the act that says "act for me
  here". `extensions/openchannel` is the unit that exercises the path end to end.

- **Its own messaging transport** — a `Channel` declares a provider the unit can carry messages on, so
  a rep's reply to a captured conversation leaves through the unit, on the member's own credential,
  through the product's ordinary reply path rather than a surface of the unit's own.

  **A unit never sends. It DECLARES a transport and the core calls it.** The chain is: the timeline
  reply box → `activities.SendMessage` (authorization, consent, recipient resolved from the links) →
  staging → the comms dispatcher → the unit's `Channel.Send`. So the tier's outbound refusals stand
  untouched — a unit still may not spend an outbound cap from a tool or a job tick. What changed is
  that a human staged the message, the seat gate re-read them, and the core hands the unit something
  to carry.

  Three parts of the declaration carry weight. `Provider` is a row in `channel_provider` and takes
  **that column's** grammar, which is snake (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`) and not the ingress system's kebab —
  `deal-room` is a legal ingress system and an illegal provider. `Send` may be **nil**, and that is the
  documented capture-only case: a reply attempt is then answered with the deployment fact rather than a
  fault. `Live` is **required whenever `Send` is present**: it answers, per member and without spending
  the credential, whether the connection is still usable. A confirmed "no" parks the delivery where a
  human can see it; "I could not tell" is an error and is retried. Reading either as the other destroys
  a message or sends it twice.

  A unit names the **transport**, never the activity kind. The kind a channel message lands under is
  the core's and fixed by the contract (ADR-0107/A158); letting a unit name one would undo that axis
  split from outside the core. A unit shadowing a core provider — `telegram`, say — fails the boot,
  because every Telegram reply would otherwise leave on the unit's per-member credential instead of the
  workspace's bot: the same message, sent by a different person, with nothing on screen different.

- **Its own frontend** — a `frontend/` directory whose screen is aliased into the SPA and rendered at
  the unit's route. Removing a unit is a one-place operation again: delete the unit directory. An
  import gate (`frontend/scripts/ext-imports.test.ts`) holds a unit screen to the published surface,
  the same way the Go marker gate holds its handlers.

**The one upstream-owned file a unit may edit: `pnpm-lock.yaml`.** A unit frontend that declares npm
dependencies changes the root lockfile, so the rule stated at the top of this page — *a unit edits no
upstream-owned file* — holds for every unit except a frontend-bearing one with dependencies of its own,
and holds for that one everywhere except the lockfile. `DESIGN.md` §4.6 records why. Nothing else in
the tree is written by adding a unit.

**The shipping rule that exception implies.** A unit's transitive npm packages enter the SPA bundle and
run at the same origin, in the same session, as the product. The import gate proves a dependency was
*declared*; it does not allowlist what may be declared, and it does not require the lockfile diff to be
read. That is acceptable **only** under this tier's standing posture — units are reviewed, first-party
or otherwise trusted code (see the closing section) — so adding a frontend-bearing unit means a human
reviews the `pnpm-lock.yaml` diff on the same terms as the unit's Go. A unit whose dependencies you
would not vendor into the core is a unit you do not compose.

Three generated files carry the composed set into the SPA: `extensions.gen.ts` (the contract-derived
descriptors, which is what `#/ext/<name>` renders for a unit with no screen), `extscreens.gen.ts` (which
unit package renders which unit) and `extlocales.gen.ts` (every unit's own copy, merged into the one
catalogue). All three have a committed empty-tree counterpart under `frontend/src/composition/`, so the
vanilla lane builds and runs with no generator having been invoked.

One ordering constraint remains worth knowing: the SPA gates affordances with `useCan(object, action)`
over an `RbacObject` **generated from `crm.yaml`'s enums**, so a page gated on an extension-owned RBAC
object needs the contract overlay — which is why the API surface landed before any frontend work can.

**What the tier does NOT protect against, stated here because the surface reads like a boundary.** Units
are **reviewed, first-party or otherwise trusted code**, compiled into the same process. Every wall
described in this document is defence in depth against *mistakes* — it makes the accidental
cross-tenant query or the forgotten scope a loud failure — and none of it is a sandbox against a unit
that is trying. In-process Go can read the keyvault root key from the environment; nothing in the database narrows a
unit's SQL to a workspace; and every handler runs as the shared
`margince_app` role, which holds DML on core tables, on every *other* unit's tables, and on
`extension_secret`. Issue #628 (a per-unit database role) is the one change that would move any of this
from convention to enforcement, and even then the in-process reach remains. `backend/pkg/extension/runtime.go`
carries the same statement at the seam itself.

## The guardrails — held from the tree

The tier is defended by fitness tests and scripts, so the guarantees can't rot into stale prose:

| Guarantee | Held by |
|---|---|
| A unit imports only the marker-allowlisted `pkg/**` surface — never `internal/**`, `cmd/**`, an unmarked `pkg` package, the composition module, or a sibling unit | `backend/gates/extensions_arch_test.go` |
| The surface marker exists only under `pkg/` — no silent allowlist widening elsewhere | `backend/gates/extensions_arch_test.go` |
| The composed set is wired only at the role `main.go`s, and each required role actually wires it | `backend/gates/extensions_arch_test.go` |
| Vanilla composition reproduces the committed stub byte-for-byte | `make check-composition` |
| The published surface doesn't break compatibility (advisory before the first release tag, enforcing after) | `scripts/check-pkg-freeze.sh` |
| The core stays jurisdiction-neutral | `scripts/check-no-jurisdiction.sh` |
| No unit table carries a workspace column, row-level security or a policy, and none touches anything in `public` | `make check-ext-migrations` (applies each unit's migrations as a minted restricted role) |
| Every unit table grants the runtime role exactly `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` — a table granting *nothing* satisfied the old one-sided allowlist and then answered `permission denied` at the first call | `make check-ext-migrations` |
| A unit's SQL names only that unit's own `ext.ext_<name>_…` tables — the mistake-defence half of the shared-role reach described above, reading through the string constants a table name is spelled with | `backend/gates/extensionsqlscope_test.go` |
| A unit's write to a CORE record goes through the product's own write path — the caller's live RBAC, the row-scope check on the subject, the audit row, the outbox event — and carries the unit's attribution under a core-stamped evidence member no caller may supply | `extension.Tx.Core()` (`internal/compose/extcore.go`), `storekit.withExtensionAttribution` |
| A scheduled tick and a bus delivery write no core record at all: both run with no caller, and a core write is checked against the caller's own permissions | `internal/compose/extcore.go` (`refuseUnattended`), `extsubscribe_test.go`, `extledger_integration_test.go` |
| A unit's ledger row names a table in that unit's own namespace, and its event a verb in that unit's own namespace — the namespace comes from the invocation, so neither is a string a unit can spell | `internal/compose/extledger.go`, `extledger_test.go` |
| A unit's own write records BOTH its ledger row and its event, or neither — the same write shape the core holds itself to, in one call that cannot be half-made | `extension.Tx.Record`, `backend/gates/writeshape_test.go`, `extledger_integration_test.go` |
| A unit lands a record in the product only where an operator can see that it does: `source_system` is derived from a DECLARED ingress source, so a typo is a refusal rather than a second provenance namespace | `internal/compose/extingress.go` (`declaredIngress`), `internal/compose/extensions.go` (`preflightIngress`) |
| An ingest runs on the named member's LIVE authority, and only for a member who currently holds one of that unit's user-scoped secrets — so a unit cannot act as a colleague who never asked it to | `internal/compose/extingressauthority.go`, `extingress_integration_test.go` |
| An ingest is refused from an invocation that HAS a caller, and from inside a transaction the unit is holding — the second on a pool of one, where the alternative is a hang rather than a failure | `internal/compose/extingress.go`, `extingress_test.go`, `extingress_integration_test.go` |
| An address may be offered as identity evidence only by a source that DECLARED the key — refused attributably at the gate, and held for every other caller of the pipeline by capture's own admission check | `internal/compose/extingress.go` (`refuseUndeclaredMergeKey`), `internal/modules/capture/sinkchannel.go` (`admitCounterpartyKeys`) |
| The published record type cannot silently fall behind the core's capture envelope: every field is mirrored or waived with its reason | `internal/compose/extingressdrift_test.go` |
| A unit may file a message on a transport it DECLARED and on no other, and no other kind may name a transport at all — a record claiming a journey it did not make is one the reply path would answer on | `internal/compose/extingress.go` (`refuseUndeclaredTransport`) |
| A unit may bind a counterparty identity only under a provider it supplies — otherwise it could attach an account it controls to somebody else's person record and take that person's next reply | `internal/compose/extingress.go` (`refuseUnitIdentity`) |
| A unit cannot shadow a core channel provider: the collision is caught in the RECONCILE, where both sets exist, and fails the boot rather than silently re-routing that provider's replies through the unit | `internal/compose/channelprovider.go` |
| A `Send` without a `Live` is refused, and the core asks `Live` BEFORE handing over a message — a disconnected member parks where a human can see it, an unreachable provider is retried | `backend/pkg/extension/channel.go`, `internal/compose/extchannelsend.go` |
| A unit's listener consumes only the streams its declared event types route to, and no core group consumes the extension stream | `internal/compose/extsubscribe.go`, `internal/shared/kernel/events/extensiontypes_test.go` |
| A subscription naming an event type nothing can route is refused at boot, rather than registering a consumer group that never delivers | `internal/compose/extensions.go` (`preflightSubscriptions`) |
| A core write is refused in an overlay workspace rather than landing in a native table nothing reads, resolved FRESH per write | `internal/compose/extcore.go` (`admit` → `overlayModeOf`) |
| A unit's shipped `migrations/` is actually embedded and applied — the directory and the field are two facts, and the gates read different ones | `backend/tools/gen-composition` (the `Migrations` field must name a var whose `//go:embed` covers the layer) |
| The runtime pool is not the migration owner: no superuser, no BYPASSRLS, and no ownership of the `ext` schema *or* anything in it | `compose.AssertRuntimeRole`, at boot and on `/readyz` |
| A declaration the composer cannot honour is refused rather than discarded — an unknown job role, governance declared on the wrong half of a pair, a `$ref` in an advertised schema, a multi-document base contract | `backend/tools/gen-composition` |
| Every declared extension operation is mounted, and every mounted route was declared | `backend/internal/compose/extparity_test.go` |
| A unit's served tool is dispatched only by that unit's own route — one unit cannot inherit another's handler by naming its verb | `backend/internal/compose/extparity_test.go` |
| A unit's SCREEN reaches the core only through the published surface (`frontend/package.json`'s `exports`), and npm only through what its own package declares | `frontend/scripts/ext-imports.test.ts` — a vitest fitness function over the TypeScript AST, carrying its own fixture suite |
| A unit's screen is held to the same design system as core — tokens, fonts, icons, spacing | All five sweep `extensions/*/frontend` as well as `frontend/src`: `check-ds-purity.sh`, `check-font-lock.sh`, `check-icon-glyph.sh`, `check-space-tokens.sh` and `check-ds-spacing.sh` (that last one diff-scoped, through git pathspecs rather than a walk). That they all still reach the tier is itself held: `check-ext-frontend-walk.test.sh` plants a violation in a fixture unit at two depths and requires each gate to name it, and reads its subject list out of the `fe-ds-gates` recipe so a sixth gate cannot join unread |
| …and renders no native dropdown | `frontend/src/design-system/native-controls.test.ts` — a vitest fitness function over the TypeScript AST, reaching every extension frontend layer at any depth |
| A unit cannot ship a second copy of state the host owns (React's hook dispatcher, react-query's QueryClient) | `gen-composition` refuses them as direct dependencies; `resolve.dedupe` catches a transitive one |
| A unit's copy is namespaced to that unit and cannot rewrite a core string | `gen-composition` (`mergeUnitLocales`), and core keys win the lookup |
| A unit screen's own test suite is RUN, not merely typechecked | `frontend/vitest.ext.config.ts` via `make fe-test-ext`, which `make check-fe` calls |

The compiler does the heaviest lifting for free (an extension's module path is outside the backend
module, so `internal/**` is unreachable by construction); the tests hold the rest of the contract that
the compiler alone wouldn't catch, and every extension source dir is enrolled the moment it exists —
including the CI fixtures under `fixtures/extensions/` (`crm-hello`, the smallest unit that exercises
the whole path).
