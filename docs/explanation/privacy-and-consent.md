# Privacy, consent & the GDPR engines

How Margince meets data-subject obligations: the **consent suppression gate** that guards every
outbound send, and the **privacy engines** (erasure, subject-access, retention) that a fulfilled
request executes. The product refuses scraping-based enrichment in the first place; the legal
position behind that, for the EU and Vietnam, is a whitepaper kept with the company's business
material rather than in this tree. Two modules cooperate — `consent` owns the gate and the case queue, `privacy` owns
the machinery — and they are stitched together at the composition root, never by a sibling import.

## The default-deny suppression gate (`consent`)

`consent` owns per-purpose consent: the purpose catalog, each person's current state, and an
**append-only proof log**. The load-bearing piece is the **Gate** — the default-deny check every
outbound surface consults *before anything leaves the workspace*:

- The question is always **per purpose**: a `marketing` grant never authorizes a `profiling` use.
- **Default-deny in every direction** — an unknown purpose, an address that resolves to no subject,
  state `unknown`, and state `withdrawn` all block. A double-opt-in purpose additionally requires the
  confirmed round-trip on the proof log (a granted-but-unconfirmed row does not send). That round
  trip is completed **only by the data subject**, by spending a single-use link mailed to their own
  live primary address — there is no operator-held token, because a token an operator can read and
  hand back proves nothing about the mailbox it was supposed to reach.
- A refusal answers `ErrConsentNotGranted` and names only the address — it discloses nothing new.

The gate is spelled once (`consent.NewGate`) and **injected into the send path** (activities) at the
composition root, so consent never becomes an import edge between siblings. Every consent *state* write
also appends a proof row (Art. 7(1) demonstrability) — a fitness test (`consentproof_test.go`) fails any
state write that skips its proof.

## The privacy engines (`privacy`)

`privacy` owns the GDPR machinery a fulfilled request runs. The DSR **case queue** lives in `consent`
(the `data_subject_request` rows + their HTTP surface); the composition root injects privacy's engines
into consent's handlers.

- **Art. 17 erasure** (`Eraser.ErasePerson`) — anonymize the normalized rows in place, purge raw
  capture, embeddings, and attachment bytes, hash the identifiers onto a **suppression list** so
  re-capture can't resurrect the subject, and prove it with a **PII-free audit tombstone** — all in
  **one transaction per record**. Atomicity *is* the guarantee. It refuses a subject under `legal_hold`.
- **Art. 15 subject access** (`AssembleSAR`) — one *privileged* read (needs the `person.delete` grant
  **and** an unbounded row scope) gathers everything held about a person — channels, deals, leads,
  activities, attachments, consent + its proof log, raw capture, field origins — into one export
  package, itself audited (`action=export`).
- **The nightly retention evaluator** (`EvaluateWorkspace`, run as one River job per workspace off
  the `privacy_retention` dispatcher in `cmd/worker`, default every 24h) — evaluates **one**
  workspace's enabled policies and applies the policy's single action to over-age records, **one
  audited transaction per record**, and a tenant whose pass fails fails its own job row.
  `legal_hold` rows are never auto-acted, and an activity is held transitively when any linked
  person/organization/deal is held. A policy whose scope the engine doesn't understand is
  **skipped loudly**, never half-applied.

## The single-transaction cross-store exception

`privacy` owns exactly one table (`erasure_suppression`) — yet erasure and retention deliberately
**write tables they do not own**: `person`, `person_email`/`_phone`/`_social`,
`person_channel_identity`, `lead`, `activity`, `activity_participant`, `graph_interaction_edge`,
`linkedin_connection`, `comms_outbound`, `deal`, `attachment`, `embedding`, `raw_capture`,
`field_provenance`, `preference_token`, `capture_pending_counterparty`, `voice_learning_signal`,
`ai_call` and `ai_call_payload`. The ratified list is the cross-writer map in
`backend/gates/tableownership_test.go`, which gates it — that file, not this page, is the authority.

Four of those are worth naming for *why* nothing else can reach them. A **channel identity** is the key
an inbound message would re-bind the subject by, so it must die in the same commit that hashes it onto
the suppression list. A **LinkedIn ghost** holds the subject's name, employer and address, imported
from a colleague's export without the subject ever being asked, and is invisible to every person-keyed
clause because a ghost is not a person row. The **interaction edge** would otherwise be left to a bus
consumer, and an Art. 17 obligation discharged by an event is one that fails silently when the bus is
behind. And a participant's **address arm** exists precisely for a party who never became a record, so
it survives the `person_email` purge and would keep the erased address re-matchable.

That is by design: a data-subject
obligation must reach **every** store that holds the subject, in **one transaction per record** —
routing each purge through the owning module would trade away the atomicity that is the guarantee.

This is the one sanctioned exception to "a module writes only its own tables." Every such write is
**ratified per table** in `backend/gates/tableownership_test.go` with a self-contained rationale; a reasonless
or stale waiver fails the test. See
[reference/modules.md](../reference/modules.md) for the ownership map and
[write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md) for the write shape these purges still ride.

## Jurisdiction retention floors

A destructive retention action must not violate a statutory floor. Country packs register through the
`ports/jurisdiction` seam and **compile into the binary by a blank import** — core code never names a
jurisdiction. The **`de`** (German) pack declares GoBD retention classes; the retention evaluator takes
the strictest compiled-in **commercial-correspondence** floor and shields external business
correspondence (a *Handelsbrief*) from destruction below it — while an internal note or task, which is
not correspondence, carries no floor. A fitness test pins that boundary (a 400-day email survives; a
same-age note is erased).

**What qualifies correspondence as a *Handelsbrief*.** Two things, and both are recorded on the record
itself the moment they happen rather than re-derived later:

- **A deal it is filed under concludes** — won, or carrying an offer past draft.
- **It is filed under a project.** A project is a commercial engagement from the moment it exists, so
  its correspondence documents an actual transaction whether or not a deal on it has closed. This is
  what reaches mail from a negotiation that was lost and from delivery work years after the deal that
  started it — both of which the deal rule alone misses.

**The mark is permanent, and moving the record does not remove it.** Relinking an activity away from
the project, archiving the project, or closing it all leave the classification standing. The evidence
behind it is frozen too: the project's name is copied at the moment it qualifies, so a later rename
does not rewrite what the record says. Removing a mark takes a named person giving a written reason,
through the controller's release path. The asymmetry is deliberate — over-retention is an argument to
have with a supervisory authority, and destruction is irreversible.
