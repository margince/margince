# The AI runtime — tasks, tiers, routing, and the one gate

How every AI call in Margince is *named*, *routed*, *metered*, *traced*, and
*certified*. This is the plumbing beneath the features: the cold-start read-back,
deep-read extraction, capture classification, the agent loop, briefs — they all
speak the same task vocabulary and pass through the same Router. For what an
*agent* does with a call, see [agent-surface.md](agent-surface.md); for how the
governance gate admits it, see [authorization.md](authorization.md). This page is
the model runtime itself.

```

**Four principles hold this together:**

1. **Contract-first.** *What* a task is — its fallback ladder, its budget posture
   — lives in `ai-tasks.yaml` and compiles into the binary. Changing policy is a
   rebuild, drift-gated exactly like `crm.yaml`. *Which* model serves a tier is
   runtime config. Policy and deployment never blur.
2. **One gate.** Every AI call — real, fake, or embedding — goes through the
   `ai.Router`. There is no second path: `--ai-fake` rides the same metered,
   traced Router (fake provider only), and two arch fitness tests fail the build
   if a model client is constructed outside it.
3. **BYOK, egress-honest.** Margince runs no inference of its own. The
   key, the endpoint, and the DPA are the customer's; the `profile` names where
   inference is allowed to happen.
4. **Honest tracing.** One `ai_call` row per *attempt* — retries, degrades, and
   escalations are all visible, and a served model's identity is read from the
   wire, never overclaimed.

## The task contract

A **task** is a named AI workload — `cold_start`, `site_extract`,
`capture_classify`, `agent_loop`, and 15 more (19 in all, including the
deep-read `site_fact_extract`, the Voice-DNA `voice_build`, and the
certification `cert_judge`). Code never picks a model; it names a task, and the
Router resolves the rest.

**A task is not one prompt.** The contract also names each task's **invocation
sites** — the places this build actually calls the model — and whether the task
ships at all: 16 shipped tasks carry **23 sites**
(`cold_start` alone has four), and 3 tasks are declared `planned`, with no site,
no scenario and no certification record. The site is the unit everything
downstream counts in, because a task-level number lets one certified prompt stand
for another that was never measured.

Each task declares a **ladder** — an ordered list of capability **tiers** — an
**execution mode**, and a **budget posture**:

```yaml
# backend/api/ai-tasks.yaml
tiers: [local_small, cheap_cloud, premium, frontier, local_large]

tasks:
  cold_start:    {ladder: [cheap_cloud, premium], execution_mode: interactive, on_budget_exhausted: degrade}
  site_extract:  {ladder: [premium],              execution_mode: background,  on_budget_exhausted: queue}
  capture_classify: {ladder: [local_small, cheap_cloud], execution_mode: background, on_budget_exhausted: queue}
```

- **Tiers** are *capability classes*, not models: `local_small` / `local_large`
  (on-box, zero-egress), `cheap_cloud` (fast/cheap hosted), `premium` (strong
  hosted reasoning), `frontier` (the strongest a deployment will pay for — no
  task ladder names it, so it costs nothing until one does).
  A task's ladder is its **fallback order** — the Router starts at
  the first tier and walks to the next on a provider error or a schema-validation
  failure, so a transient failure degrades instead of dropping the call.
- **`execution_mode`** names who is waiting: `interactive` (a human, mid-flow)
  or `background` (a worker job). It pairs with the budget posture — an
  interactive task always declares `degrade`, a background task `queue` — and
  the contract's own header states the invariant.
- **`on_budget_exhausted`** is what happens when the workspace's monthly model
  budget is spent: `degrade` (answer on a cheaper rung — at 100% an interactive
  task is pinned to `local_small` rather than blocked) or `queue` (defer rather
  than overspend). A queued deferral is a **typed refusal**: the Router returns
  `BudgetDeferralError` (unwraps to `ErrBudgetDeferred`) carrying
  `NextAttemptAt` — the next budget window — **before any provider attempt or
  `ai_call` row exists**, so a deferral costs nothing and traces nothing. A
  premium-only task like `site_extract` has no cheaper rung — it queues.

### Every field in `ai-tasks.yaml`

Top level:

| Field | Shape | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `tiers` | ordered list | the capability classes. **Declaration order is meaningful** — it becomes the `Tier` constant order and the routing schema's enum order, byte-stable across generator runs. |
| `tasks` | map of name → task | the workloads. Names are lowercase `snake_case`, mapping 1:1 onto the generated `ai.TaskX` constant. |
| `embed` | `{tier, cost_unit}` | the embeddings workload — deliberately **not** a task: its tier is not a chat tier and it has no prompt, no text answer and no completion path, so it carries no sites and no certification obligation. |
| `degrade_to` | map tier → tier | where a tier falls when the budget guardrail degrades it. `local_small` maps to itself: the floor. |

Per task:

| Field | Values | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `ladder` | ordered tiers | the **fallback order**. The Router starts at the first rung and walks to the next on a provider error or a schema-validation failure. A single-rung ladder (`site_extract`: `[premium]`) has nowhere to fall. |
| `execution_mode` | `interactive` \| `background` | who is waiting — a human mid-flow, or a worker job. |
| `on_budget_exhausted` | `degrade` \| `queue` | what a spent monthly budget does. **Closed pairing invariant:** `interactive` always pairs with `degrade`, `background` with `queue`. `queue` returns a typed deferral to the task's own durable carrier — the Router never creates an unowned job. |
| `status` | `shipped` \| `planned` | whether the task exists in this build. `shipped` obliges every site to be registered, cased and covered by a scenario; `planned` forbids a site, a scenario and a record. This is what stops an unimplemented task presenting as certified. |
| `sites` | list | the named invocation sites. A bare string is a site of kind `one_shot`; `{name: x, kind: y}` declares another kind. |
| `sites[].kind` | `one_shot` \| `multi_turn` \| `agent_loop` | how the model is invoked, and therefore how much of the site one certification run can cover. A closed set: a new kind is a code-and-test change, because each needs a certification strategy that can actually run it. |
| `no_payload` | `true` (or absent) | content from this task must **never** reach `ai_call_payload`, whatever the deployment's capture posture says. A parsed field precisely so a data-protection control is not load-bearing prose in a `doc:` string. |
| `company_context` | `none` \| `{scopes, token_budget, conditional}` | the bounded company-profile block this task's prompts may carry. **Not optional** — an absent policy is a build error, never a runtime default. |
| `company_context.scopes` | any of `identity`, `positioning`, `sales`, `offer`, `market`, `proof`, `administrative` | which bounded views of the company profile may be injected. That declaration order is also the wire and fingerprint order, so re-ordering a selection cannot make it hash differently. |
| `company_context.token_budget` | positive int | what the renderer bounds the block by. Required with any scope — at zero the scopes would ride no prompt — and refused without one, since a budget attached to a policy that selects nothing reads as a deleted scope list. |
| `company_context.conditional` | `true` (or absent) | inject only when the caller asks, rather than always. |
| `cost_unit` | rule name, or absent | which pre-flight estimator rule prices this task (`per_message`, `per_person`; `per_entity` for embed). The arithmetic stays in code — naming the rule here is what lets the build prove the mapping is **total** in both directions. Absent means unpriced. |
| `doc` | string | carried through into the generated constant's comment. Prose only: nothing may depend on it. |

`make gen` compiles this into `tasks_gen.go` (and the routing shape in `config/margince.schema.json`);
the drift gate fails the build if the generated files don't match, so the contract
can't silently rot. Adding a task or a site is a checklist of its own:
[how-to/add-an-ai-task.md](../how-to/add-an-ai-task.md).

## The routing config

The **runtime binding** says which real provider and model serves each tier, and
nothing about policy. It is the `ai.routing` **setting** — a row, not a file —
read from the database by every SERVING role, so the api and the worker cannot
drift onto different bindings and a change needs no restart. **No role reads a
routing file** — `--ai-routing` / `MARGINCE_AI_ROUTING` are still accepted so an
existing command line parses, then ignored with a warning naming what to use
instead. The DB-less lanes are told their model outright rather than handed a
file: `worker siteread` and `worker aitask` take `--model provider:model` or
`--ai-fake`, and the certification runner is given `MODEL=` and `JUDGE=`, because
each probes ONE named binding and a file on whichever machine ran it was never
comparable between engineers.

A fresh installation declares it under `seeds.ai_routing` in `margince.yaml`
(consumed once, at bootstrap; a dev stack's is in `config/margince.dev.yaml`); a
running one is rebound under Settings → AI or through `PUT /v1/ai/routing`. The
shape below is that binding's.

```yaml
profile: eu_hosted            # WHERE inference may run (the egress posture)
tiers:
  local_small: {provider: ollama,  model: gemma3}
  cheap_cloud: {provider: gemini,  model: gemini-2.5-flash}
  premium:     {provider: gemini,  model: gemini-2.5-pro}
embeddings:    {provider: gemini}
```

- **`profile`** is the §4 location ladder — the privacy choice of *where* the
  model runs: `eu_hosted` (partner-operated EU inference, the default),
  `sovereign` (zero egress by construction), and so on. It constrains, it never
  leaks.
- **No key ever lives in the binding.** A provider names only itself, and a stray
  `api_key:` is a *boot error* rather than a convenience. Where the key comes from
  depends on who is asking: a served installation resolves it from the **key
  vault**, while the DB-less lanes below — `worker siteread`, `worker aitask`, the
  certification runner — open no vault and read the conventional environment
  variable (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, …) on every run.
- **A tier may be left unbound.** A deployment legitimately runs only some
  workloads. An unbound ladder isn't a startup error — but it is **loud**: boot
  warns per task (`task cold_start: no bound tier on ladder [cheap_cloud premium];
  calls will be refused`), and `/readyz` names the AI state (`configured` |
  `fake` | `unconfigured`) so an operator reads the gap off the boot log, not off
  a refused call at 3am.
- **Which bound models can serve a task is the ladder PLUS the `degrade_to`
  closure**, and the second half is the one a reader forgets. `ai.LeadingTier`
  is the rung that answers when nothing has gone wrong (the ladder's first);
  `ai.ServableTiers` is every rung that can end up answering — the ladder, then
  the transitive closure of `degrade_to` over it. `draft_reply`'s ladder is
  `[cheap_cloud, premium]` and `cheap_cloud` degrades to `local_small`, so the
  model bound at `local_small` serves `draft_reply` under budget pressure while
  the ladder never names that rung. Any claim of the form "these models can
  answer this task" — a certification report, an operator's own audit of what a
  binding exposes — is built from the closure or it is answering a narrower
  question than it looks like.

Binding a tier to a provider is an edit to *this setting*; changing a task's
ladder is an edit to the *contract* (above). Swapping gemini for a local Ollama,
or pinning a premium Sonnet, never touches code — see
[connect-a-cloud-model-provider.md](../how-to/connect-a-cloud-model-provider.md)
and [enrich-with-a-local-llm.md](../how-to/enrich-with-a-local-llm.md).

## The one gate — `ai.Router`

Every call converges on the Router (`internal/modules/ai`). In one pass it:

- **meters** the workspace's monthly model budget — derived from seat count —
  (and applies `execution_mode` + `on_budget_exhausted` when spent);
- **injects company context** where the task's policy asks for it (below);
- **strips secrets** from the prompt before the request leaves the process, and
  again from anything it records;
- **walks the ladder** — one attempt per rung, escalating on provider error or a
  structured-output schema failure;
- **traces** every attempt (below).

**Company context** is the installation's own profile (offer, ICP, voice —
what the onboarding wizard confirms) injected into task prompts as governed
data, not ad-hoc prose: a request carries typed `ContextScopes`, a
`ContextFingerprint`, and byte/token estimates (`ports/model`), all of which
land in the `ai_call` trace, key the response cache (same prompt + different
context is a different call), and surface as per-task `/metrics` counters. The
whole lane sits behind the `company_context.rollout` kill switch in
`margince.yaml` — ordered `off < read < tasks < onboarding` (default
`onboarding` = fully on; `platform/deployconfig`).

The DB-less variant `ai.NewLocalRouter` serves the same seam for offline
fixtures and the certification lane; `--ai-fake` binds the offline fake *through
the Router*, so dev and test exercise the exact metering/tracing/budget path
production does. `TestNoModelClientOutsideTheGate` and `TestOneModelPathPerRole`
(in `backend/gates/arch_test.go`) keep it that way — the gate is a property of the
build, not a habit.

## Honest tracing — the certification grain

Every attempt writes one `ai_call` row (migration `0100`), not one row per
final answer:

- `logical_call_id` groups the attempts of one logical call; `attempt` orders
  them; `is_terminal` marks the one the caller actually received. Retries,
  degrades, and ladder escalations are all visible; metrics count terminals only.
- **`served_identity_source`** labels how the served model's identity was learned
  — `response` (the provider reported it on the wire), `echo` (a generic
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint that merely echoed the requested id), or
  `configured` (a total-failure fallback to the binding). A model can never
  *overclaim* a higher-trust source than its adapter earned.
- **Config snapshots** are hash-keyed in `ai_call_config` (task-contract hash +
  routing-config hash) — the deterministic build/deploy facts, never a key or a
  prompt.
- **Company-context provenance** rides the same row (migration `0102`): the
  context scopes, fingerprint, and size that shaped the prompt — so "what did
  the model know about us" is answerable per attempt.
- Embeddings are traced too, and their rows age out at 90 days via the privacy
  retention evaluator.

The write path is the standard one — `ai_call` + `ai_call_payload` in one
`WithWorkspaceTx` — so a trace is written and audited exactly like any domain
row. See [write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md).

## Cost — the meter collects tokens, a rate table prices them

Inference is the customer's own provider bill, so cost is **transparency,
never a gate** — it is a labeled number shown *about* their spend, and the budget
guardrail above stays token-denominated. The write path reflects that: the meter and
`ai_call` collect **tokens only** and know nothing about money. Price is a *read-side*
computation, so a corrected rate heals every figure and nothing rides the
model-call hot path.

```
 WRITE (tokens only)                      RATES (fx_rate-style)            READ (priced on demand)
 ──────────────────                       ────────────────────            ───────────────────────
 ai_call: tokens_in / cached_tokens       ai_model_rate                   • /ai/usage  → actuals   (phase 1)
          / cache_write_tokens              per (provider, model, day)     • backfill preview → estimate (phase 2)
          / tokens_out  (per attempt)       4 micro-USD/MTok components          │
                                            input · cache_read ·                 └─ cost = uncached_in×in + cached×read
                                            cache_write · output                          + cache_write×write + out×out
```

- **The rate table (`ai_model_rate`).** Workspace-scoped, one row per
  `(provider, model, effective_date)` — keyed on the *concrete model that
  served*, not the tier, so rebinding a tier keeps its rates. Each row is four
  integer
  **micro-USD-per-MTok** prices: input, cache-read, cache-write, output. Lookup
  works like `fx_rate` — the latest row dated on or before the call's day wins,
  and a price change is a *new* row, never an edit. Local providers get explicit
  all-zero rows, so a local call prices as an honest `0`. **Unpriced ≠ free:** a
  call whose model has no rate row is *unpriced* — still counted and surfaced,
  just flagged as a different thing from a real `$0`. Changing a price is a single
  insert; no rebuild.
- **One formula, three consumers.** The four-bucket price arithmetic is written
  once as `PriceCall`. `/ai/usage` reports **actuals** through
  `RateStore.CostReport` — SQL that mirrors that same arithmetic row-for-row, to
  price a whole window in one round-trip — while the backfill preview and the
  certification record both call `PriceCall` directly, for a **pre-flight
  estimate** and a per-run cost stamp. One formula, so the numbers can't drift.
- **The pre-flight estimate (`compose/costestimate`).** The same estimate told as one
  end-to-end story — the consent screen, the scope count, and the spend that lands after the
  import finishes — is [mail-history-import.md](mail-history-import.md); the formula is here.
  Before a backfill runs,
  the preview estimates its cost as `Σ per-task (per-unit cost × expected units)`:
  - **Per-unit cost** comes from the last 7 days of `ai_call` history, grouped
    into `(task, tier, provider, model)` slices. Each slice is priced at whichever
    model *will* serve it now: the model that served it if that's still bound,
    else its own tier's current binding (so a rebind re-prices instantly), else
    the ladder head if that tier is now unbound.
  - **Expected units** come from the connection's completed backfill yields:
    messages to classify, people to enrich, entities to embed. A run measures its
    own yield as it pages — the counterparty resolver reports whether an ensure
    *minted* a person/organization or merely resolved onto rows that already
    existed, and those counts commit in the same statement as `scanned`/`captured`,
    so a page that fails to commit counts nothing.
  - **When there's nothing to price from, the preview says so instead of
    guessing.** With no history it falls back to a priced **work-shape floor** and
    labels the estimate `heuristic` (vs `observed`). If the whole preview would be
    unpriced it *hides* the cost field rather than show a misleading `0`, and a
    cost-read failure degrades it to a plain message count — never a block on the
    consent flow.

  *(Two deliberate under-counts. The people/org yields count only what a run's own
  pages minted: a sender the tier gate defers is resolved by the verdict engine
  long after that page, and the person it may eventually mint is nobody's page to
  claim. So a run that minted nobody reports "ratio unavailable" rather than zero
  people, floating the enrich line to its `heuristic` floor instead of quoting a
  confident $0. And the cold-start floor counts message embeds only: person/org
  embeds would over-quote at its full-email unit size.)*

## Certification — proving a binding is good enough

Because a task names a contract and the model behind it is swappable, you can
**certify a model against a task before you trust it**. The cert lane
(`compose/aicert`) folds several cache-off runs into one verdict —
`certified` / `supported_degraded` / `not_supported` — saved as a committed JSON
record. That's how you compare a cheaper candidate against the model you run
today *before* rebinding a tier under Settings → AI.

A run is told what to measure — never a default read off the runner's disk. It is
either ONE named candidate (`MODEL=`) bound to every task, or a whole
**deployment** (`ROUTING=`), where each task is certified against the model that
deployment binds at the task's leading ladder rung. The second exists because
nobody deploys a model: an install binds one model at `local_small` and another
at `premium`, and those are the answers it actually depends on. The rungs below a
leading one are reachable under budget pressure and want their own runs — a
record names one model, so pooling two would leave it unable to say which
answered.

What it measures is the part worth knowing. The corpus holds
**fixtures, not prompts**: a scenario carries the input a site is given, and the
site's own certification case builds the request with the **production** builder
and judges the reply with the **production** validator. A corpus of prompts would
certify a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the
original. On top of that deterministic pass, a pinned rubric judge on its *own*
`cert_judge` binding (never the candidate's) scores quality 0–100.

Each run therefore reports one of four outcomes — `accepted`, `wrong_answer`,
`invalid`, `abstained` — kept distinct because a validator refusing a
fabrication and a model declining to fabricate look identical once collapsed into
a single number. A record also names the **scope** it covers
(`full_invocation` > `single_turn` > `single_call`), so a site whose product
answer is assembled from calls the run never made cannot read as fully certified.

Nothing about this gates a merge: the lane is paid and BYOK-gated, so
`make e2e-ai-report` *reports* readiness per shipped site — band, counts, scope,
binding, and whether the record is **current**, **partial**, **stale** or
**absent**. The four never collapse into each other, because they are four
different claims: staleness is a lie, absence is honest, and a `partial` is right
about everything it says and silent about the rest.

**A record is stamped per scenario, and the task stamp is the fold of those.**
`aicert.ScenarioStamps` digests each scenario on its own — the scenario whole,
the request the site's own code builds from it, and the request the grader is
sent — and `FoldScenarioStamps` folds them into the task-level `PromptVersion`
that `PromptVersion` now delegates to; the record carries both
(`ScenarioRecord.Stamp` beside the task's). The fold alone can only say "this
record is no longer about what ships", never *which* case moved, so adding a
tenth scenario used to invalidate nine measurements that were still true and
price the fix at all ten. Per scenario the same edit reads `partial 9/10` and
costs one — `SCENARIOS` is `measured/total`, and `partial` means every scenario
the record measured is still current while the corpus has grown cases it has
never seen. The guarantee is unchanged and finer rather than weaker: a record
still cannot describe a scenario, or a prompt, it did not measure. A record
written before those per-scenario stamps existed carries none and is judged by
its task stamp exactly as before.

The deterministic gates are what block — the census refuses a shipped task whose
site nobody wrote, a site the contract never declared, a planned task someone
quietly implemented, a site with no certification case, and a closed answer
vocabulary with a kind no scenario ever asked a model to produce
(`TestEveryClosedAnswerKindCarriesAScenario`). To debug a verdict, the lane
dumps every candidate and judge call to a local JSONL trace — the *same*
secret-stripped `ai_call_payload` shape (on by default, gitignored).

### Every field in a scenario file

One YAML file per scenario under
`internal/compose/aicert/corpus/<task>/<name>.yaml`, loaded by `LoadCorpus`:

| Field | Required | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | the scenario's own name — what a record row and a failure message call it. |
| `task` | yes | must name a task the contract carries. |
| `site` | yes | which registered invocation site is under certification. The site, not the task, is the unit: one scenario can never stand for a task's other prompts. |
| `source` | yes | provenance. Must be `hand_authored` — an `extracted:` scenario is refused outright, because the review and redaction path for one is not wired. |
| `sanitized_by` | yes | who reviewed this scenario for sensitive content. Non-empty, and it names a reviewer rather than a tool by accident. |
| `fixture` | yes | **the data production is given** — never the prompt production sends. The site's own case turns it into the request, which is what makes the run measure the shipped builder instead of a copy of it. |
| `expect.outcome` | yes | which of `accepted` / `wrong_answer` / `invalid` / `abstained` the site's validator must report. Nothing privileges `accepted` — that is what lets a scenario whose right answer is *silence* exist. |
| `expect.answer` | when the outcome asserts content | the answer itself, **in that site's own vocabulary** — a bare token, a list, a map, a `{min,max}` band. There is no common shape, because what separates a right answer from a wrong one differs per site. |
| `expect.rubric` | when quality is scored | what the grader is told to weigh. It may only ask for what the site's reply envelope can carry: a rubric scoring a field the schema cannot hold measures nothing and can only mark a correct reply down. |
| `expect.bands` | yes | `certified_min` / `degraded_min` / `floor` — the 1–100 score gates the run's median and minimum are folded against. Omitting the block is refused rather than defaulted, since a missing gate would silently pass everything. |
| `expect.caps` | optional | the run's resource ceilings, breached exactly like a failed structural check — never silently. `max_tokens` budgets the model's **answer** alone: not the fixed input the model cannot shrink, and not a reasoning model's internal thinking, so a rich-input scenario with a tight output cap tests drafting within budget rather than prompt size. `p95_latency_ms` judges **cloud-served candidates only**, since a same-host engine's latency is a fact about the hardware. Both are read off the run's **pooled** calls — a site that answers in three requests spent all three. |

## Reference

| Concern | Where |
|---|---|
| Task contract (tasks, tiers, ladders, budget posture, status/sites/context/cost unit) | `backend/api/ai-tasks.yaml` → `tasks_gen.go` (via `tools/gen-aitasks`, `make gen`) |
| Invocation-site census (which sites this build ships, and the case certifying each) | `internal/compose/aitaskregistry.go` (`NewTaskCensus`) · `internal/compose/aitasks` |
| Runtime binding (tier → provider/model, profile) | the `ai.routing` setting — seeded from `seeds.ai_routing`, changed under Settings → AI. Shape declared under `$defs.aiRouting` in `config/margince.schema.json` |
| BYOK keys | the key vault, set under Settings → AI → Model provider keys. The conventional environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`) are read once, to seal a key into the vault on first boot |
| The gate | `internal/modules/ai` — `ai.Router` / `ai.NewLocalRouter`; `--ai-fake` flag |
| Providers | `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini` (native) · `ollama`, `vllm`, `openai_compatible` · `fake` |
| Tracing | `ai_call` / `ai_call_payload` / `ai_call_config` (migrations `0088`, `0089`, `0100`, `0102`) |
| Cost rates | `ai_model_rate` (per provider/model, effective-dated, micro-USD) · seeded by `SeedModelRates` |
| Pricer (actuals) | `PriceCall` + `RateStore` (`internal/modules/ai`) → `/ai/usage` `cost_est_minor` |
| Pre-flight estimate | `internal/compose/costestimate` (backfill preview `estimated_cost_minor` + `estimate_quality`) |
| Budget deferral | `BudgetDeferralError` / `ErrBudgetDeferred` (`internal/modules/ai/budget.go`) |
| Company context | `companycontextprompt.go` (compose) · rollout switch `company_context.rollout` (`margince.yaml`, `platform/deployconfig`, migration `0105`) |
| Boot/ops surface | `/readyz` AI state; per-task unbound-ladder boot warnings |
| Certification | `internal/compose/aicert` — `make e2e-ai`, `make e2e-ai-report` |
