# Company context — cold-start onboarding and governed AI grounding

One installation serves one organization — and Margince keeps a confirmed,
durable understanding of that company: what it sells, to whom, and what proves
it. That understanding is born in first-run onboarding (from a website read, a
manual form, or both), lives as provenance-bearing rows in the `people` module,
and is injected into AI tasks as **governed, scoped data** — never as ad-hoc
prompt prose. This page explains the whole lane; the model runtime it feeds is
[ai-runtime.md](ai-runtime.md).

## The four canonical layers

There is no denormalized "AI profile" that can drift from company data. The
governed source of truth is four distinct concepts, all workspace-scoped and
provenance-bearing:

1. **Identity** — canonical `organization` columns and the primary domain.
2. **Business profile** — human-confirmable single-value statements
   (`organization_profile_field`: offer summary, ICP, value proposition, USP,
   buyer roles, …) with evidence, confidence, source, and capture actor.
3. **Evidence facts** — repeatable, source-grounded findings
   (`organization_fact`: locations, services, products, certifications, named
   customers, technologies, …), linked back to their `site_read`.
4. **Operational dossier** — the crawl record itself (`site_read`: progress,
   pages read/skipped, stop reason). Never prompt context by itself.

The standing rule across all of them: **human edits outrank machine
refreshes.** A website re-read may *propose* a change; it never silently
replaces a human-held value.

Over these rows the people module exposes one typed, read-only
**`CompanyContext`** read model (`GET /company/context`) — deterministic field
ordering, named scopes (identity, positioning, sales, offer, markets, proof,
capabilities, administrative), and a deterministic fingerprint. Consumers get
bounded views of this model; nothing assembles its own company prompt from
tables.

## The cold start — six stops, one narrating rail

First login lands in a full-viewport work surface: one scene owns the board at a
time and a derived step rail narrates beside it
(`onboarding-conversation/`, whose pure reducer IS the conversation — the rail
cannot disagree with it). State persists server-side (`/onboarding/state`,
`onboarding_wizard_state` in the identity module), so a reload or an OAuth
round-trip reconstructs the same scene.

The creator's rail reads **Read · Confirm · Basis · Voice · Connect · Preferences**.
Basis is the installation's reporting basis — base currency and reporting
timezone — asked once, right after the company is confirmed and before any step
about the person answering; an admin can change either later in Settings, and a
currency a deal has already frozen is shown locked there as it is here.

**An invited member walks the personal stops.** Their company and its basis are
already settled, so their rail reads Voice · Connect · Preferences and the
restore plan lands them straight in the voice act. The app's onboarding gate
sends every human whose wizard state is absent or unfinished here, a read seat
excepted (it cannot write the checkpoint the journey ends on), so a member
invited later trains their voice and connects their mailbox exactly as the
creator did.

The server refuses a member checkpoint at any creator-only step (`read`,
`confirm`, `basis`, `invite`, `team`) with the text "members begin at Voice",
which is now also the route.

The `step` enum on the wire (`read, confirm, basis, invite, team, voice, results,
connect, complete`) is the checkpoint vocabulary, not the rail's — the rail is a
detour-aware view over it, so a clarify question can take the whole screen
without claiming a numbered slot.

- **Website ingestion is an optional accelerator, never a gate.** "Enter it
  myself" needs exactly three fields — company name, *what do you sell?*
  (`offer_summary`), *who do you sell it to?* (`icp`) — and works with AI
  routing disabled and zero egress. Legal/VAT/address fields are conditional,
  never a universal block.
- **A website read is progressive and honest.** The onboarding dossier
  (`/company/site-reads` start → poll → confirm, an *unbound* `site_read` that
  needs no pre-existing organization) streams grounded findings as pages are
  read, under the standing crawl guarantees: SSRF guard, robots handling, hard
  page/byte/time bounds, and evidence-or-omit — an ungrounded value stays
  empty rather than guessed.
- **Confirmation is accept-subset in one transaction.** The confirm request
  binds the inspected read version, writes only the selected fields/facts
  (audited, outbox-evented), and treats any edited value as a human assertion.
  Nothing persists to domain tables before confirmation. Published team
  members are never company rows — each is staged as a separate lead proposal.

After first run, the **Company context** settings screen edits the same
canonical rows, and "Refresh from website" runs the same dossier pipeline —
classifying every proposed value as *new*, a *machine change*, or a *human
conflict*; only the first two can be bulk-accepted, a human conflict demands
an explicit keep/accept/edit decision.

## Injection: every task declares a policy

"Use it everywhere" means every AI task declares what it gets — not that every
model call receives a generic company blurb. The compose-layer provider
(`companycontextprompt.go`) holds a **closed policy registry**: each task in
the [task contract](ai-runtime.md) declares either `none` (context would bias
the task — capture classification, website extraction, embeddings) or named
scopes with a token budget (agent loop, reply drafting, offer drafting,
NL-search vocabulary). A fitness test fails the build when a task has no
explicit declaration.

The safety frame:

- Context is rendered into a delimiter-escaped **`<company_context_data>`
  user-data block** — data, never system instructions; website-derived text
  stays untrusted even after acceptance.
- The selected scopes and the exact **context fingerprint** ride the `ai_call`
  trace and the response-cache key, so a profile edit changes both — no stale
  cached answer survives it.
- The lane sits behind the ordered `company_context.rollout` kill switch in
  `margince.yaml` (`off < read < tasks < onboarding`, default fully on);
  migration `0105` backfilled existing installations from their anchor rows
  without crawling or touching provenance.
