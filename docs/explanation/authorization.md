# Authorization & access control

How Margince decides **who may do what**, and — importantly — **where** that decision is made. If you
are looking for the auth check in an HTTP handler and not finding it, this page is the explanation:
the check is at the store/service entry point, and Postgres row-level security is the backstop beneath
it. That is a design decision, not drift.

## Why authorization lives below the handlers

Most web apps gate authorization in the HTTP layer — a middleware checks the permission and everything
behind it trusts the caller. This codebase deliberately does not, because **HTTP is only one caller**.
The same module behavior is reached by:

- the REST surface (`internal/compose/server.go`),
- the MCP tool surface (`/mcp` on the api),
- agent runs (the Surface-B runner acting under a passport — see [agent-surface.md](agent-surface.md)),
- workers (retention, reconciliation, the close-date sweep, the outbox relay's consumers),
- compose orchestration flows (briefs, reports, exports, enrichment).

A check in HTTP middleware protects exactly one of those paths; every other caller becomes a bypass.
So the check lives at the one boundary all of them cross: the module's **store** (CRUD modules) or
**service** (engine modules) entry points.

## Who is calling — principals and the three transports

Every request carries a **principal** (`shared/kernel/principal`): its type (human / agent / connector
/ system), its identity, its seat, its scopes, and — for agents — the human it acts on behalf of.
There are three ways a caller reaches `/v1` or the tools, and **all three resolve the same admission +
RBAC**:

| Caller | Transport | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| A **human** | web app / HTTP | the `crm_session` cookie (from `POST /v1/auth/login`) |
| An **agent** | REST | `Authorization: Bearer mgp_…` (a passport) |
| An **agent** | MCP (`/mcp`, Streamable HTTP) | `Authorization: Bearer mgp_…` — a passport minted directly, or one the OAuth handshake issued when a human lent theirs |

(No request names a tenant: one installation serves one organization, and the
admission middleware binds that singleton workspace itself before any handler runs.)

### What a passport is

A **passport** (formally an *Agent Seat Passport*) is the credential an AI agent uses on both agent
transports. It is a scoped, expiring, revocable bearer token — a `mgp_`-prefixed string — that a
**human mints for an agent** (`POST /v1/passports`, session-authed, human-only). Two properties make
it safe:

- **An agent never has more rights than the human who minted it.** Effective authority is the
  passport's scopes (`read`, `draft`, `write`, `send`, `enrich`) **intersected with the granting
  human's live RBAC and seat**.
- **It is re-authenticated on every call**, and the human's seat + RBAC are re-derived each time — so
  revoking the passport (or demoting the human) **binds mid-session**, including for an MCP session
  that is already connected.

Minting and using one: [how-to/mint-a-passport.md](../how-to/mint-a-passport.md) →
[how-to/connect-an-mcp-client.md](../how-to/connect-an-mcp-client.md).

## The two layers, precisely

**1. Admission — *may this agent take this kind of action at all?*** `platform/auth`'s `Gate.Admit`
combines the agent **scope**, the **seat ceiling** (a `read` seat may GET but never mutate), and the
**autonomy tier** (below), re-derived live on every call. Object-level RBAC and row visibility are
**not** `Admit`'s job — they live at the store (layer 2). Handlers decode the request and encode the
response; they never decide authorization.

**2. Object RBAC + row scope — *may this principal do this to this particular record?*** Enforced where
the SQL is, at the store/service entry: **`auth.Require`** (object level — does the role grant this
verb on this object type?), plus **`auth.EnsureVisible`** / the list-scope clauses (`ScopeClause`) /
`auth.EnsureLinkTarget` (row level — may they see this row?). These often must run **inside the same
transaction** as the read or write they guard — checking in a handler would be checking a different
snapshot. What the roles actually grant, how row scope (own/team/all) and teams decide "which rows,"
and how a per-record share widens visibility on top, is its own page:
[rbac-roles-and-teams.md](rbac-roles-and-teams.md).

## Autonomy tiers — how agent actions are governed (🟢 / 🟡)

An action's autonomy tier is **declared once in the contract** (`x-mcp-tool: { tier: … }`) and enforced
**below the transport**, so REST and MCP behave identically:

- **🟢 `auto_execute`** — the default, and what a passport's holder could already do unaided. A passport
  carries the granting human's own seat, grants and row scope, so requiring a second confirmation from
  that same person made the agent surface weaker than the person behind it rather than safer. Audited,
  with agent-stamped provenance. This is ADR-0055's argument — already accepted for *deciding* an
  approval — applied to doing the thing itself.
- **🟡 `confirmation_required`** — kept for the calls whose destination the credential-holder did **not**
  choose. `enrich` is the standing case: the MODEL names the URL the server fetches, so persuading the
  model reaches an address nobody with the credential picked, which is an egress question rather than an
  authority one. An installation can also **floor** a verb back to confirm-first per record type by
  declaring `tier: confirmation_required` on the operation, and every verb still carries the staging
  machinery that makes the floor land in a human's inbox rather than dead-ending as a refusal.
- **Human-only** routes (consent, DSR, passport issuance, pipeline configuration) **refuse an agent
  principal outright** — each one would let a credential widen what a credential may do. This is the
  boundary that matters: the things a credential must not widen, not the things its holder can already
  do.
- A mutating operation carrying **no tier is default-denied** for agents (the agent-policy generator
  refuses to ship an un-tiered mutation in the first place — see
  [contract-first.md](contract-first.md)).

**Deciding an approval is not in that class** (ADR-0055). A passport is a credential a human minted
and can revoke, carrying that human's own seat, grants and row scope, so answering a staged proposal
on it is that person answering — from the conversation the call was staged in rather than only from
the web app. What bounds the answer is what bounds them: the RBAC the staged effect itself needs,
row-scope visibility of its target, the seat ceiling, expiry — plus the caps they chose to lend,
because a decision spends what the release spends. A `read` passport lists the queue and is refused
the decision; releasing a held message spends `send`; and no passport answers its own volume step-up,
which is the one decision `on_behalf_of` cannot make safe. An agent never exceeds the granting
human's live authority.

The premise is that a person is behind the call, so the surface where nobody is — a scheduled,
unattended run — cannot reach the decide verbs at all: the runner's catalog allowlist is gated
against them by name, because a run that could answer its own staged calls would walk through the
confirm-first tier by itself.

Alongside the tier, the same annotation declares the **passport scope** the operation consumes
(`x-mcp-tool: { scope: read|draft|write|send|enrich }`). The two are independent gates and neither
substitutes for the other: the tier decides whether a human confirms the act, the scope decides
whether the act was delegable at all. Scopes are a flat set — `ScopeSet.Has` is exact membership, so
holding `write` does not imply holding `send` or `enrich`. A passport whose granting human withheld
`enrich` is refused an enrichment call with `ErrScopeExceeded` before the tier is ever consulted,
whether it arrives over MCP or REST.

## The structural backstop — one transaction seam and the app role's grants

No table carries row-level security and no policy exists to read: an installation holds one
organization (ADR-0061), so what a statement reaches is decided by the statement and by the role
issuing it.

- Module statements are reachable **only** through `database.WithWorkspaceTx`, which **fails closed
  before any SQL** if no workspace is bound. That one seam is the auditable transaction boundary —
  `scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh` refuses a module statement issued over the bare pool.
- The runtime **`margince_app`** role is not a superuser, has no `BYPASSRLS`, and does not own the
  tables, so its DML-only grants bind it. `compose.AssertRuntimeRole` refuses to serve otherwise, at
  boot and on `/readyz`. (The schema owner `margince_owner` is used only by migrations.)
- Row scope is the application's: `auth.Require`, `auth.EnsureVisible` and the list-scope clauses in
  `platform/auth` decide what a principal reaches, with object denial answering 403 and a row-scope
  miss answering 404.

See [write-backbone.md](write-backbone.md) for the write path that rides inside this transaction.

## How it is wired

- **One gate, injected once.** `platform/auth` is the admission point; no module re-implements it. It
  depends on the `ports/authz` seam (implemented by `identity`) so platform never imports a module.
- **At the store/service entry** every exported method calls the gate (`auth.Require` +
  `auth.EnsureVisible`); a fitness test (`rbacgate_test.go`) fails any store entry point that doesn't.
- **REST** rides a compose middleware (`agentGate`): for an agent principal it resolves the operation's
  tier/policy from the generated admission table before the handler runs, and default-denies an
  un-policied mutation. A human caller skips it — their RBAC at the store *is* the approval.
- **MCP** binds the same tool registry and admission gate (`compose.NewRegistry`) — one gate, two
  transports.

## The rules that follow

- **Anything that returns a record is a read** and carries the row-scope gate — including replay,
  conflict, and error paths. A 409 that echoes a hidden row's id is a leak.
- **A foreign-key reference to a row-scoped record is also a read** (`auth.EnsureLinkTarget`): naming a
  deal's organization or an activity's link target asserts the target exists, so it is gated like a
  read of that target.
- **Object denial answers 403** (`apperrors.ErrPermissionDenied`): your role cannot do this at all.
- **A row-scope miss answers 404** (`apperrors.ErrNotFound`): a record you cannot see is
  indistinguishable from one that does not exist, so a leaked UUID buys nothing (existence-hiding).
- **REST, MCP, agents, and workers share one gate** — an agent under a passport is capped by the
  granting human's live seat and RBAC at the same store entry point.
