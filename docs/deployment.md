# Deploying Margince (self-hosting)

Margince ships deployment-target-agnostic container materials: you can run it on
any container platform (Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker Compose, a plain host). This
repo carries only the **generic** pieces; a concrete deployment (its domain,
secrets, platform manifests) is yours to own — keep those in your own infra repo.

## What ships in this repo

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` (target `api`) | `cmd/api` (HTTP) + bundled `cmd/migrate`; applies migrations at boot |
| `Dockerfile` (target `worker`) | `cmd/worker` — outbox relay, retention, Surface-B AI (no HTTP) |
| `Dockerfile` (target `web`) | the Vite SPA behind nginx-unprivileged |
| `scripts/deploy/api-entrypoint.sh` | migrate as owner, then serve the API as app |
| `scripts/deploy/worker-entrypoint.sh` | start the worker as app (no owner credential) |
| `scripts/deploy/db-bootstrap.sql` | one-time DB role + database + extension setup |
| `frontend/nginx.conf` | SPA static serving (listens on 8080, non-root) |

The three roles live in the ONE root `Dockerfile`, each as a build target of
the same name sharing a common Go builder base, and every image builds with
the **repo root** as context (the Go build folds in the `extensions/*` packs
via `gen-composition`; `docker buildx bake` builds all three through
`docker-bake.hcl`):

```bash
docker build --target api    -t margince-api:local .
docker build --target worker -t margince-worker:local .
docker build --target web    -t margince-web:local .
```

## The two-role database model (required — read this first)

Margince separates what serves traffic from what applies DDL, and that wall is
made of table grants. A superuser ignores every grant, so **both** runtime roles
must be neither a superuser nor granted `BYPASSRLS` — the api refuses to serve on
an exempt runtime role. Two such roles are required:

- **`margince_owner`** — owns the database + tables, runs migrations (DDL) and the
  custom-fields runtime-DDL pool.
- **`margince_app`** — the runtime role the api + worker connect as. Its table
  grants are applied by migration `0015_app_role_grants`, which is a **no-op
  unless the role already exists** — so it must be created *before* the first
  migration runs.

Create the roles + database + extensions **once**, as a Postgres superuser
(pgvector is not a "trusted" extension, so a non-superuser cannot install it from
a migration):

```bash
# Pass the passwords RAW (not pre-quoted) — the script quotes/escapes them.
psql "postgres://postgres:…@<host>:5432/postgres" \
  -v owner_pw="$OWNER_PW" -v app_pw="$APP_PW" \
  -f scripts/deploy/db-bootstrap.sql
```

It is idempotent. The app containers then hold only the two non-superuser DSNs.

## Configuration — everything via the environment

The images bake in **no** instance configuration. All settings come from the
runtime environment; the binaries resolve every flag from a `MARGINCE_*` env
fallback. The full table of record is
[`docs/reference/configuration.md`](reference/configuration.md); the annotated
env template is [`.env.example`](../.env.example). The essentials:

| Var | Role | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN` | api | owner-role DSN — migrations + custom-fields DDL (read by the entrypoint) |
| `MARGINCE_DSN` | api, worker | app-role DSN the process serves under |
| `MARGINCE_REDIS` | api, worker | Redis address (event bus / outbox relay) |
| `MARGINCE_CONFIG` | api, worker | path to the mounted `margince.yaml` (bootstrap org + admin) |
| `MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | api | first-boot admin password (entrypoint writes it to the file `margince.yaml` references) |
| `MARGINCE_AI_ROUTING` | api, worker | **ignored, and warns.** The AI binding is a stored setting: declare it under `seeds.ai_routing` in `margince.yaml` before first boot, or set it under Settings → AI afterwards |
| `MARGINCE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | api, worker | canonical external base URL (buyer-facing links / marketing mail) |

Do **not** set `MARGINCE_ENV=dev` in a deployed environment. It decides two
things about LICENSING and nothing else: which authorities are honoured
(`dev`/`test` additionally accept our non-production licensers), and whether the
installation may run unlicensed at all — with none configured, `cmd/api` and
`cmd/worker` refuse to boot unless the environment says non-production (see
[configuration.md](reference/configuration.md#license)).

It no longer enables the data reset; that is `operations.allow_data_reset`,
below.

### First-boot bootstrap config

On the first boot against an empty database the api bootstraps the organization +
admin from the file `MARGINCE_CONFIG` points to. Mount your own `margince.yaml`
(see [`config/margince.example.yaml`](../config/margince.example.yaml)) at that
path and set `MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. A missing config file just boots an
existing installation.

**The example ships with `operations:` commented out, and mounting it as-is
keeps it that way.** Uncommenting `operations.allow_data_reset` arms
`POST /v1/admin/reset-data`, which purges this installation's tenant data back
to its first-boot state and renders the "Reset data" button to every admin seat.
A deployed installation leaves it off.

To enable AI, declare the binding in the `margince.yaml` you already mount, under
`seeds.ai_routing` — it is consumed at first boot and the database is
authoritative afterwards, so an installation already running is rebound under
Settings → AI instead. Each bound cloud provider needs its BYOK key, put in
under Settings → AI → Model provider keys; the conventional environment variable
(`GEMINI_API_KEY`, …) is read once, to seal a key into the vault on first boot.
There is no routing file to mount for the api and the worker's serving role. The
DB-less lanes still read one explicitly — `worker siteread`, `worker aitask` and
the certification runner — so a deployment that runs those mounts a file for them
and for nothing else.

The example config declares the MCP connector (`mcp.connector_enabled: true`)
so a local stack works unedited. A deployment that mounts it as-is therefore
serves `/mcp` and `/oauth/*`, and **must** set `MARGINCE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — the
api refuses to boot on that gate without it. Remove the `mcp` block to keep the
connector off; the code default is off, so an absent block exposes nothing.

**Decide the retention posture before first boot if the installation must keep
everything.** By default the shipped storage-limitation ladder runs: an
unconverted lead is anonymized after a year, a meeting transcript and an AI
payload are erased after a year, which is the storage-limitation obligation of
Art. 5(1)(e) and only that one — see the [compliance
handbook](handbook/compliance.md) for what an installation reading employee
mailboxes still owes, none of which this product checks. An
installation under a contractual or statutory keep-everything obligation sets

```yaml
seeds:
  retention:
    default_policy: retain_only
```

which plants the same policy rows and suppresses every destructive action — no
anonymize, no erase, whatever a policy says. Archive still runs, because
archiving retains. The posture is a first-boot value only: an admin changes it
afterwards on the privacy settings screen, and it survives restarts and upgrades
because it is stored, not re-read from this file. Setting it here rather than in
the UI closes the window between bootstrap planting the rows and the first admin
sign-in, in which the nightly pass could otherwise fire.

Your `margince.yaml`'s `password_file` **must point to where the entrypoint writes
`MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`** — `secrets/admin-password` (i.e.
`/app/secrets/admin-password`; the api's working dir is `/app`). Set that value in
your config. (The example config's default differs, so change it to match.)

**After the first boot succeeds, retire both:** remove the `bootstrap_admin`
section from `margince.yaml` and unset `MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. ADR-0061 §2
consumes bootstrap values exactly once — restarts never reconcile them into an
existing organization — so past that point the credential grants nothing and only
sits at rest. The entrypoint stops writing the file once an organization exists
and says so on stderr if the variable is still set. Change an existing user's
password with `margince-migrate reset-password` instead.

## Routing

Both services sit behind one reverse proxy / ingress, under **one host**:

| path | service |
| --- | --- |
| `/v1`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` | api |
| `/webhooks/gmail`, `/webhooks/hubspot` | api (present only with that connector configured) |
| `/oauth/`, `/mcp`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (and its `/mcp`-suffixed form) | api (present only with the MCP connector declared) |
| everything else, `/` included | web (the SPA, port 8080) |

Route the OAuth metadata documents by those exact paths, not by a
`/.well-known/*` prefix: they are the only things the api serves under
`/.well-known`, and a prefix rule takes `/.well-known/acme-challenge/…` away
from whatever answers your certificate challenges. The webhook row is the api's
because the caller is the provider, not a browser: each handler verifies its own
push, so the SPA cannot stand in for it.

One host, not two, because three things cross the split:

- The SPA calls the API **same-origin** at `location.origin + "/v1"`. There is no
  build-time API base — the same web image works for any domain.
- An MCP client discovers this installation at `/.well-known/oauth-*` and
  connects at `/mcp` on that same origin: RFC 9728 discovery is a chain rooted in
  the resource server's own 401, which a split origin breaks. It must be the host
  `--public-base-url` names.
- The consent flow crosses the two services in both directions. `GET
  /oauth/authorize` (api) redirects the human's browser to `/#/oauth-consent`
  (web); that screen reads `/v1/oauth/consent-request` and posts the decision
  back to `/oauth/authorize` (api). An ingress that serves `/` from somewhere
  else than `/oauth/authorize`, or that routes `/oauth` to the web service, 404s
  the human in the middle of approving a connection — and only there, since the
  client's own handshake never touches the SPA.

## Health checks

- `/healthz` — liveness: a dumb 200 (a DB outage must not restart-loop the api).
- `/readyz` — readiness: 200 when every dependency (Postgres, Redis, and any
  configured object store / vault / AI) is up, else 503 naming the unready one.

Point liveness at `/healthz` and readiness at `/readyz`.

## Deploy all three roles at ONE release (the guard that enforces it)

Every release image carries the release it was built from, in three places
derived from one build argument (`MARGINCE_RELEASE_VERSION`, set from
`docker-bake.hcl`'s `VERSION`):

| Where | How to read it | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| OCI label `org.opencontainers.image.version` | `docker inspect` / `crane config` — no pull needed | an operator diffing a set |
| `/etc/margince/release-version` | `docker run --rm <image> cat /etc/margince/release-version`, or `kubectl exec` into a running one | an operator inspecting a role that is running or crash-looping. It is the only place the **web** image's release can be read from the outside, because nginx runs none of our code — but it is not what the web tier itself compares against |
| the Go binary's link-time stamp, and the SPA bundle's compiled-in copy | the guard below. This is the value each role actually compares; the label and the file are for people | the software itself |

**Why any of this exists.** You pull each role image by tag, and two tag pulls
are two requests. A publish landing between them hands you a set whose roles come
from different releases — most easily with `latest`. The OCI distribution
protocol cannot express "these three manifests, or none", so a registry has no
way to refuse it at the pull. So the roles refuse it at the run:

- **api** — the authority, because its image ships `cmd/migrate` and its
  entrypoint applies the schema before it serves:
  the schema your installation runs on is the schema its release brought. At boot
  it records its own release as the installation's, and logs
  `installation release recorded from=… to=…` when that changes.
- **worker** — compares its release against that record and **exits** on a
  mismatch, naming both versions and telling you to deploy every role at one
  release. (The message names no images or registry on purpose: this software also
  runs from a plain host, and "re-pull" is not an action available to everyone who
  can hit this. On a container platform, re-pulling the set is what it means for
  you.) Your orchestrator will restart it, and it will exit again: a crash-looping
  worker with the two versions in its log is the intended, visible outcome. It
  does not resolve itself, because nothing about a torn pull does.
  **The comparison runs at start only.** A worker that is already running when the
  api records a new release is not checked again, so restarting the api ALONE
  leaves the old worker in service until something else restarts it
  ([#1734](https://github.com/margince/margince/issues/1734)).
- **web** — the SPA compares its own release against the one
  `GET /v1/auth/capabilities` reports and refuses to render the app, offering a
  reload. The probe is anonymous, so the check happens before anyone signs in —
  which matters, because a mixed set breaks the login request first.

**The asymmetry is what makes an upgrade possible.** The api moves first by
definition, so a rollout converges instead of deadlocking on two roles each
waiting for the other. Rollback works for the same reason: the api states the
release rather than advancing a counter, so going back to an older one needs no
permission.

**The recorded release is last writer wins, so do not leave api replicas from two
releases running.** Whichever api records last decides what release the
installation is, including an older one — a `1970.42` pod that restarts after
`1970.43` recorded will put the record back to `1970.42`, and every correctly
deployed `1970.43` worker then refuses to start. Finish the api rollout rather
than pausing it half-done, and the same for a rollback
([#1735](https://github.com/margince/margince/issues/1735)).

**An unstamped image disables the guard entirely.** An absent or `dev` release is
skipped by all three roles — the api records nothing, the worker compares nothing
and starts, and the SPA reports no release and never blocks. An unstamped api also
**leaves any release a stamped api already recorded exactly as it was**: it does
not clear the record, so one locally built binary run against a real installation
cannot disarm the guard for the roles that boot after it.

That is what makes a locally built image (`docker build --target api .`, which
passes no `MARGINCE_RELEASE_VERSION`) usable, and it is a fact worth knowing about
your own pipeline: **a deploy recipe that builds these targets itself, rather than
pulling released images, gets no guard**
([#1728](https://github.com/margince/margince/issues/1728)). Pass the
argument if you want one.

## Order of operations

1. Bootstrap the database once (`db-bootstrap.sql`, as superuser).
2. Deploy the **api** — its entrypoint runs `migrate up` (owner) then serves.
3. Deploy the **worker** and **web**, at the SAME release as the api (above). On
   a cold database the worker may restart a few times until the api has
   migrated; this is expected. A worker that keeps restarting *after* the api is
   serving, with a release mismatch in its log, is a torn pull rather than a
   slow start.

## Operational notes

- **Outbound mail needs the worker** — the api only stages sends; `cmd/worker`
  transmits them.
- **Admin lockout break-glass:** `margince-migrate reset-password --dsn <owner>
  --email <admin-email>` (reads the new password from stdin). It will also set
  a password on a member who has none, so it *can* onboard — but it needs the
  owner DSN and a shell, so prefer the set-password link below for that.
- **Onboarding without outbound mail:** an invited member is created active with
  no password, so on an installation with no mail channel the invite alone
  leaves an account nobody can sign in as. Settings → Users & roles then offers a
  per-member **"Get set-password link"** — a single-use link the admin delivers
  out of band, redeemed through the normal set-password screen (ADR-0061
  Amendment 1). It needs `--public-base-url` set, since a credential-bearing
  link is never derived from a request `Host`.
- **AI keys fail closed:** a missing/invalid provider key disables the bound AI
  lanes but leaves core CRUD + auth working.
