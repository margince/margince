# Getting started

This tutorial takes you from a fresh clone to a running Margince
instance with a bootstrapped organization, using only the repository's
Makefile targets.

## Prerequisites

- Go ≥ 1.26 (the module pins toolchain `go1.26.4`)
- Docker (dev Postgres 16 + Redis 7 run as containers)
- `golangci-lint` (only needed for `make check`)

All targets exist at the repo root (a thin delegator) and in `backend/`;
the commands below work from either directory.

## 1. Start the databases

```sh
make db-up
```

This starts a `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container on port 15432 and a
`redis:7` container on port 16379, waits for Postgres to accept
connections, and applies `scripts/db-init.sql` (which creates the
runtime app role — the API never runs as the schema owner).

## 2. Apply the migrations

```sh
make migrate
```

Runs `cmd/migrate up` with the owner DSN: all core migrations plus the
fork-owned custom namespace. Migrations are reversible; see
[how-to/apply-migrations.md](../how-to/apply-migrations.md).

## 3. Run the API

```sh
make dev
```

`make dev` brings up the infra, re-runs db-up + migrate, and boots `cmd/api`
with the app-role DSN, behind the app on `:8080`. By default
the outbox relay runs inline in the api process, so this one command is a
complete install; it returns when ready and the servers run in the
background — stop them with `make dev-stop`.

One installation serves one organization: on its first boot
against the empty database, the api bootstraps the organization and admin
user from the deployment config `config/margince.yaml`. `make dev` seeds
that file (and the admin password file) from
[`config/margince.example.yaml`](../../config/margince.example.yaml) on first
run and then **leaves it** — edit it freely; delete it to reset. There is no
bootstrap screen or endpoint: no request creates a workspace.

## 4. Log in

Open <http://localhost:8080> — the web UI, and the only URL you need (it
proxies `/v1` through to the api behind it) — and log in with the seeded admin (`admin@demo.test` /
`demo-password-123` — the password `make seed-dev` chose when it completed the
admin's first login; the operator-supplied one in the example config is refused
everywhere until it is replaced). First login lands in the
**cold start**: a full-screen gate asks for your website (or "Enter the details
yourself"), a read theatre shows the crawl as it happens, and a dossier lets you
review every field and fact before anything is written. A rail beside it narrates
where you are — Read · Confirm · Voice · Ready · Connect. It is resumable and
skippable, and explained in
[explanation/company-context.md](../explanation/company-context.md). After
that you have people, leads, the deal board, and the activity timeline —
empty, because `make dev` boots a cold installation on purpose: what you see
is what a first customer sees. Run `make seed-dev` against the running stack
when you want demo records (idempotent, re-runnable).

Prefer the API? Log in and reuse the session. The `crm_session` cookie is `Secure`, so pull it out of
the login response rather than relying on curl's jar; the server resolves its singleton organization
itself — no header selects a tenant:

```sh
SESSION=$(curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null http://localhost:8080/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@demo.test","password":"demo-password-123"}' \
  | sed -n 's/^[Ss]et-[Cc]ookie: crm_session=\([^;]*\).*/\1/p' | tr -d '\r')

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/me --cookie "crm_session=$SESSION"
```

(An agent uses a passport instead of a session — see [how-to/mint-a-passport.md](../how-to/mint-a-passport.md).)

## 5. Verify your setup

```sh
make check
```

is the merge gate (build, vet, lint, arch-lint, unit tests, contract
drift). With the containers from step 1 running,

```sh
make test-integration
```

runs the real-Postgres lane: cross-tenant isolation gates, the governed-agent-writes loop,
and the HTTP end-to-end sales flow. It fails loudly when the database is
missing — it never skips.
