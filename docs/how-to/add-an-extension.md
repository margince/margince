# Add an extension (a stable-tier unit)

For shipping a bounded add-on — a **jurisdiction pack**, a **governed agent tool**, an **HTTP surface**,
its **own tables**, its **own secrets**, a **scheduled job**, a **reaction to events**, **capture from
its own provider**, or a **messaging transport** — as a named, versioned unit under
`extensions/<name>/`, without editing any upstream-owned file — with one exception: a unit that ships a
`frontend/` with npm dependencies of its own also changes the root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and that lockfile
diff is reviewed on the same terms as the unit's Go (see
[explanation/extensibility.md](../explanation/extensibility.md)). For *why* the seam is a compile-time
declaration and what the surface guarantees, read
[explanation/extensibility.md](../explanation/extensibility.md) first. For a country pack
specifically, the live capability is retention floors; the running example below builds one.

An extension is its own Go module reaching the core through only the marker-allowlisted
`backend/pkg/**` surface. **Presence under `extensions/` is the enablement** — there is no flag to
flip. `extensions/openchannel` is the **reference unit** — it owns data, serves routes, faces an
outside provider with capture, a merge-key declaration and a transport replies leave on, and ships
a screen. Copy it first. `extensions/de` (a jurisdiction pack) and
`fixtures/extensions/crm-hello` (the walking-skeleton) are the smaller shapes.

A unit owns **all six** surfaces, frontend included: `extensions/<name>/frontend/` is a pnpm workspace
package whose default export the SPA mounts at `#/ext/<name>`. A unit that ships none still gets a
route and a generic descriptor card automatically.

Extension paths — the units, the `backend/pkg/**` seam, the composition stub and generator — carry
a [CODEOWNERS](../../CODEOWNERS) entry, so a PR touching them automatically requests the
tier owner's review.

## Scaffold the unit

1. **Create the module directory** `extensions/<name>/` — the directory name is the canonical unit
   name and must match the `Name` you declare. It obeys the grammar `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`,
   ≤32 chars (lower-case segments joined by single hyphens); the name keys SQL identifiers and URL
   paths, so anything else is refused at boot.

2. **Add its `go.mod`** — its own module, path `github.com/margince/margince/extensions/<name>`:
   ```text
   module github.com/margince/margince/extensions/<name>

   go 1.26.6
   ```

3. **Write the declaration** `extensions/<name>/<name>.go`, starting with the BUSL SPDX header (every
   hand-written `*.go` file carries it). Export `New() extension.Extension` returning an **inert
   value** — no handle into the core, nothing registered in an `init()`. When the name is hyphenated,
   only the Go **package identifier** drops the hyphen: `crm-hello` uses `package crmhello`, but its
   directory, its module path, and `Extension.Name` all keep the hyphen — a hyphen is illegal in a Go
   identifier, not in a module path:
   ```go

   func New() extension.Extension {
   	return extension.Extension{

   ```
   **Import only `backend/pkg/**` packages carrying `//margince:extension-surface`** — `pkg/extension`,
   `pkg/extension/jurisdiction` and `pkg/extension/crm` today. Any import of `internal/**`, `cmd/**`, an
   unmarked `pkg` package, the composition module, or a sibling extension fails the arch test (the
   compiler already makes `internal/**` unreachable — the test holds the rest).

## Stay inside the declared vocabularies

A jurisdiction pack supplies **policy, never behaviour** — the core retention engine consults it. So
the values you declare must be ones a core engine already understands:

- **`Code`** is a lower-case ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, unique across the composed set. A code the `de`
  pack (or any other enabled unit) already holds aborts the boot.
- **`RetentionClassName`** comes from the **closed set** — `commercial_correspondence`,
  `accounting_records`. You supply a *floor* for a known class; you do not invent a class (adding a
  new class kind is a deferred capability that hasn't landed yet). A name outside the set is refused.
- **`Period`** is a calendar span (`{Years: 6}`), never a day count, and every component is
  non-negative — a floor reaches *back*, never forward. Implausibly long spans are refused too
  (`Period.Validate` caps a component at ~1000 years), so a typo can't anchor a cutoff in the far past.
- **`Anchor`** is `occurrence` (the zero value) or `calendar_year_end`. Pick `calendar_year_end` only
  when the statute counts from the year's end (as German §147(4) AO does).

Get the statutory content right — it's legal content, not a default. Pin it with a test (below).

## Declare a governed agent tool (optional)

A unit may also contribute **agent tools** — named verbs the MCP surface serves alongside the core
ones. `extensions/openchannel` is the first-party worked example; copy its shape:

**Governance lives in the contract, not in Go.** An `extension.Tool` is a **verb and a function** and
nothing else — the tier, the Passport scope, the RBAC object, the title, the prose, the version and both
schemas all come from the contract operation that declares the verb (see the next section):

```go
Tools: []extension.Tool{{
	Name:   "openchannel_open", // lower snake_case; must equal an x-mcp-tool verb in THIS unit's api/ fragment
	Handle: open,               // omit for a contract-only request: declared, published, answers 501
}}
```

The handler signature carries the capability handle:

```go
func open(ctx context.Context, rt extension.Runtime, in json.RawMessage) (json.RawMessage, error)
```

`rt` is the **only** thing the core hands a unit, it is minted per invocation, and it is invalid the
moment the handler returns (`extension.ErrRuntimeExpired`). Today it offers `rt.Secrets()` and `rt.Tx()`.

What the surface will and will not serve:

- **`Handle` decides whether the tool runs.** Omit it and the declaration is a manifest request and
  nothing more — the route is still mounted and still published, and it answers a named **501**. Supply
  it and the tool is registered at boot into the same registry and admission gate the core tools ride,
  so its tier and scope are enforced on every call. The verb must be declared by **your own** unit's
  contract fragment: naming another unit's served verb does not borrow its handler, it gets you a 501.
- **A served 🟡 tool declares what it stages against.** `TierConfirmationRequired` is served only when
  the operation names the row its approval is about, under `x-mcp-tool.subject` — see the contract
  section below. Without it the gate has nowhere to park the call it refuses, so a handler-bearing 🟡
  tool with no subject is refused at boot rather than failing every call with no approval to redeem.
- **A served tool may not DECLARE an outbound cap.** `ScopeSend` and `ScopeEnrich` are refused for a
  handler-bearing tool, because outbound work is confirm-first everywhere else in the product and a
  🟢 outbound verb would reach a destination nobody approved. This binds the declaration, not the
  handler: a handler is ordinary Go and could open a socket regardless, which is why the composed set
  is itself the trust boundary (see
  [explanation/extensibility.md](../explanation/extensibility.md)) and a unit is added deliberately.
- **`Title` is optional but not free-form-blank.** A whitespace-only or space-framed title is refused
  at generation; a unit that declares none is listed under its verb. Declared as `x-mcp-tool.title`.
- **`RequestedScope` is required.** The vocabulary is the closed passport set (`read`, `draft`,
  `write`, `send`, `enrich`); a **served** tool may request only `read`, `draft` or `write`, since the
  two outbound caps are refused above. It is the cap a caller's passport must hold, so declare the one
  the act actually spends.

**Validate arguments yourself — the declared input schema is client-facing documentation, and nothing
on this seam checks a request body against it before your handler runs.** Call
`extension.DecodeArgs[T]` (`backend/pkg/extension/args.go`); do not write your own from
`Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields` alone, which this guide used to recommend and which leaves four holes
that each let a document the published schema forbids decide what your handler stores:

| What encoding/json does | What the contract says |
|---|---|
| matches field names **case-insensitively**, so `BODY` sets `Body` | `additionalProperties: false` |
| accepts a **repeated** member and keeps the last | one member, once |
| accepts `null` and leaves the struct zeroed | an object is required |
| decodes **one value and stops**, discarding the rest | one document |

Two of those decide *which value* a mutation writes, past a reviewer reading the first one. And
validate anything the database will cast: an id declared as a bare string reaches PostgreSQL's `::uuid`
and answers 500, so declare the shape (`format: uuid` plus a pattern) **and** check it before the
transaction. Count characters with `utf8.RuneCountInString`, never `len` — JSON Schema's `maxLength`
counts characters, so a byte count refuses text in any non-ASCII script at a length the schema you
published says will fit.

Note the known gap: a handler cannot yet return a *classified* caller-error, so a refusal surfaces as a
500 on the REST route — tracked as **#657**. That is the reason to refuse in your own code, where the
message is at least yours, rather than letting the database do it.

## Publish an HTTP surface and its governed tools

An operation is declared in a **contract fragment** under `extensions/<name>/api/`. The **filename names
the core contract it extends** — `api/crm.yaml` extends `backend/api/crm.yaml`, `api/jobs.yaml` extends
the job contract. `gen-composition` merges them into `build/composition/api/`, and the merged document is
what the operator manifest, the generated client types, the mounted routes and the docs all read.

Copy `extensions/openchannel/api/crm.yaml`. The rules that will otherwise bite:

- **Paths are relative to the document's own `servers` url**, which already ends in `/v1`. Write
  `/ext/<name>/notes/list`, never `/v1/ext/...` — the server puts the base path back when it mounts the
  route, and spelling it twice publishes `/v1/v1/ext/...` to every generated client (the composer refuses
  it).
- **Every path must sit under `/ext/<your-unit>/`.** Another unit's namespace, a core path, or a path
  template (`{id}`) are all refused.
- **POST/PUT/PATCH only.** A served extension operation *is* a governed tool invocation and its arguments
  are the request body, so GET and DELETE — which carry none — are refused. "list", "add" and "remove"
  are three POSTs on three paths.
- **`x-mcp-tool` is where governance lives**: `verb`, `version`, `title`, `tier`, `scope`, `description`.
  The `verb` must equal the `Name` of one of your unit's `Tools` entries for the operation to be served;
  `description` is required (it is the text a model selects the tool by) and so is `version`.
- **`x-rbac-object` / `x-rbac-action`** declare the object grant the caller must hold. The object is
  registered into the RBAC vocabulary `/me` serves and must be named `ext_<name>_*`. Declare both or
  neither.
- **A 🟡 operation declares what it stages against**, under `x-mcp-tool.subject`:

  ```yaml
  x-mcp-tool:
    verb: forget_note
    tier: confirmation_required
    scope: write
    subject:
      arg: note_id            # the argument carrying the row's id, as a uuid string
      table: ext_notes_note   # the unit table that row lives in
  ```

  A confirm-first call is refused and **parked** as an approval, and an approval is a judgment about a
  *thing*: the inbox shows the row, the decision authority is derived from it, and the person answering
  has to be someone who may see it. Core verbs answer that from the record they name; your operation
  names nothing the core knows about, so you say which argument carries the subject's id and which of
  your own tables the row is in. `arg` must be a property your own request schema declares, and `table`
  must be inside your unit's namespace — a unit may put its own rows in front of a human and no others.

  Deciding one of your staged calls requires **the grant the operation itself gates on**, so a 🟡
  operation must also declare `x-rbac-object` and `x-rbac-action`: deciding takes the grant performing
  it takes, and an operation with no object would be releasable by any seat that can see the inbox.

  A 🟡 operation with **no handler** needs no subject — it publishes a route that answers 501 and stages
  nothing. One your unit *serves* is refused at boot without one, because the gate would have nowhere to
  park the call it refuses and every call would fail with no approval to redeem.
- **Schemas are inline — no `$ref`, at any depth.** The composer does not resolve references, and the
  request/response schemas it reads are emitted verbatim as the MCP tool's input and output schemas: a
  client has no document to resolve a reference against, so an unresolved one would be advertised to a
  model as the argument shape. A property *named* `$ref`, and a `$ref` inside `example`, `default`,
  `const` or `enum`, are instance data rather than references and are fine.
- **The 200 body is your own schema.** The agent path wraps results in a governed envelope; the REST
  route unwraps it, so what a client receives is exactly what your `responses.200` declares. Do not
  declare the envelope — the registry wraps your schema for the agent surface too, so declaring it
  would describe the wrapper to a model as if it were the answer.
- **A fragment adds nodes; it never redefines one.** Two units may not target one JSONPath, a target
  must land under `$.paths`, `$.components.schemas`, `$.kinds` or `$.tasks`, and the node added
  directly under one of those must be a **mapping** — a scalar at `$.paths['/ext/u/thing']` publishes a
  path item that is a string. A YAML alias anywhere in an `update` is refused: it resolves inside your
  fragment, and the merged document has no anchor to match it.

## Own tables — `migrations/`

Ship `extensions/<name>/migrations/NNNN_name.up.sql` and a matching `.down.sql`, then **embed them**:

```go
//go:embed migrations
var migrations embed.FS

func New() extension.Extension {
	return extension.Extension{
		Name:       "<name>",
		Version:    "1.0.0",
		Migrations: migrations, // ← WITHOUT THIS LINE THE SQL NEVER RUNS
	}
}
```

> ### ⚠️ The field is what runs — and the generator now holds you to it
>
> The directory and the field are **two different facts**. `make check-ext-migrations` and the
> identifier-collision check read the **on-disk directory**; `cmd/migrate` applies the **embedded
> filesystem**. A unit that shipped the SQL and forgot the field used to have its SQL validated,
> blessed and reported as correct while an empty FS was applied — `make check` green, the migrate step
> saying "schema is at head", and the table never created. It failed at its first query, in
> production, with an undefined-table error. It happened once on this tier.
>
> **`gen-composition` refuses that now**, in three shapes:
>
> - a unit that ships `migrations/` and declares no `Migrations` field;
> - a `Migrations` field that does not name a package-level var;
> - a var whose `//go:embed` directive does not cover `migrations/` — including
>   `//go:embedmigrations`, which is missing the separator Go requires and so is an ordinary comment
>   leaving the FS **empty**, and including a directive pointed at some other layer.
>
> What it does **not** prove is that the bytes reaching `cmd/migrate` are the bytes the gate applied:
> an embed may cover more than `migrations/`, and an `fs.FS` assembled at run time is beyond a static
> reader. So still add the `//go:embed` line and the `Migrations:` field **in the same commit**, and
> confirm with `make migrate` + `\dt ext.*` that your table exists.

What the SQL must do, enforced by `make check-ext-migrations` (which applies your migrations as a minted
restricted role against a throwaway database and re-reads the catalog):

- Create tables only in the `ext` schema, named `ext_<name>_<table>` — the schema is shared by every
  installed unit, so the prefix is what keeps two of them apart.
- Carry NO workspace column, no row-level security and no policy — an installation holds one
  organization, so such a predicate would separate nothing, and the gate refuses all three outright.
- `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ... TO margince_app` — **exactly those four**, on every unit
  table. Not more: no unit verb issues a `TRUNCATE`, and `REFERENCES` and `TRIGGER` are refused too.
  Not fewer, and not none: the gate used to ask only "nothing outside the list", which granting
  *nothing* satisfies perfectly — and the table then answers `permission denied` at the first handler
  call, having passed every check.
- Touch nothing in `public` — the minted role holds nothing there at all, so a foreign key out of `ext`
  is refused rather than detected. A key onto a core table takes a lock on core writes and can refuse a
  core delete forever after.

**A core record is not yours to write in SQL — the port is.** `tx.Core()` is the governed door onto the
product's own records: `tx.Core().Activities().Create(…)` files an activity through the same write path
the HTTP surface uses, so it is checked against the CALLER's live permissions, refused with `ErrNotFound`
for a subject they cannot see, audited, published as an event, and attributed to your unit — all inside
the transaction your own row is in, so the two commit together or not at all.
`backend/pkg/extension/crm` holds the shapes it takes and returns.

Three refusals to design for rather than discover: a scheduled JOB TICK gets `ErrForbidden` (it runs as
your unit, with no caller whose permissions a core write could be checked against — your own tables stay
writable); an OVERLAY workspace gets `ErrOverlayUnsupported` (its native records are not the live ones);
and custom fields are refused rather than dropped. Grants are the other thing to plan: filing needs the
caller to hold your unit's object AND the core `activity` one, and nothing declares that pairing yet.

**And what your migrations may CREATE is what your SQL may NAME — in your tests too.** `rt.Tx()` runs
on the shared `margince_app` role, so a statement naming `person` would work, which is why
`TestExtensionSQLNamesOnlyTheUnitsOwnTables` (`backend/gates/extensionsqlscope_test.go`) reads **every `.go`
file your unit ships**, folds the string constants a table name is usually spelled through, and refuses
a table outside `ext.ext_<name>_…`. A unit test that seeds a core table fails it exactly as a handler
would, and that is deliberate: a test is where the habit starts. Qualify the schema — `ext` is on no `search_path` the app connects with,
so a bare `ext_openchannel_inbound` names a *public* table you do not own — and keep the name in a constant: a
name assembled at run time is a finding too, because a reader that cannot see the table cannot vouch
for it. This is defence against mistakes, not a wall; see "what the tier does NOT protect against" in
[extensibility.md](../explanation/extensibility.md).

**A new migration is a new file — including for an index.** `dbmigrate` keys on the version, so a line
added to an already-applied `0001` runs on exactly the installations that did not need it (a fresh one)
and never on the ones that do. `extensions/openchannel/migrations/0003_drain.up.sql` is the worked
example: what it adds belongs to tables the earlier files created, and it is still its own file.

**Index what your reads order by.** A list that reads newest-first and bounds the page is a sequential
scan plus a sort of every row the unit has ever written until an index covers that order — fine at the
size a unit starts at, and not the size it stays at.

## Own secrets

Declare what you will use, then reach it through the Runtime:

```go
Secrets: []extension.SecretsRequest{{Key: "signing", Scope: extension.SecretScopeWorkspace}},
```

```go
key, err := rt.Secrets().Get(ctx, "signing") // errors.Is(err, extension.ErrSecretNotFound) when absent
```

Declaring grants and stores nothing — it is a request recorded in the manifest. Keys are your unit's own
bare names, namespaced for you; there is no method that takes another unit's name.

## Own a screen — `frontend/`

Ship `extensions/<name>/frontend/package.json` and the module it names. The package is a workspace
member, so it may bring its own dependencies; `pnpm install` from the repo root links it.

```json
{
  "name": "@margince-ext/<name>",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "main": "screen.tsx",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@margince/frontend": "workspace:*",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.101.4",
    "react": "^19.2.0"
  }
}
```

Four rules, each refused at generation because each fails somewhere worse otherwise:

- **`@margince-ext/<name>`, matching the directory.** One workspace holds every enabled unit, so a
  shared name is two members claiming one identity and pnpm resolves whichever it saw last.
- **`private: true`.** A workspace member that is not private is one `pnpm publish -r` from a registry.
- **`main` names a module that exists *inside* your `frontend/`**, and its **default export** is the
  screen. Relative is required and containment is checked, not just existence: the import gate scans
  every directory named `frontend` under `extensions/`, at any depth — so a `main` of
  `../elsewhere/screen.tsx` would put your shipped code outside the one thing holding the unit/core
  boundary.
- **React, react-dom and `@tanstack/react-query` are PEERS, never dependencies.** Each keeps state the
  host owns — React's hook dispatcher, react-query's QueryClient context — and a second copy is a
  second, empty one. This is the rule that fails at *run time* if you get it wrong: hooks throw with a
  message naming neither the unit nor the cause, or the first `useQuery` reports no QueryClient on a
  page that plainly has one.

**Import the core only through `@margince/frontend/<subpath>`** — `design-system`, `api`, `app`, as
published by `frontend/package.json`'s `exports` map. That map is this side's
`//margince:extension-surface`: the Go tier gets its boundary from the compiler, a bundler gives none,
so `frontend/scripts/ext-imports.test.ts` is the boundary. It refuses a relative path escaping your
unit, an unpublished subpath, and any bare specifier your own `package.json` does not declare —
`devDependencies` count for test files only, so a screen cannot pull a test runner into the bundle.

**Name your page in a level-1 header, exactly once.** The app shell mints the page's `h1` for a core
screen, but it *yields* to a composed unit — your surface is yours to name, and the shell has no title
key for a route the NAV rail deliberately does not carry. So your screen's top
`<SectionHeader …  level={1} />` IS the page's heading, and every header under it stays at the default
`2`. Leave the top one at the default and your page ships with no heading for a reader to jump to.

**Where your screen is offered is your `Secrets` scope, and nothing you declare for the UI.** Your
screen lives at `#/ext/<name>`, and the rail does not carry it: enabling a unit gives an installation
something to CONFIGURE, not an eleventh destination beside Pipeline and Reports. It is listed in
Settings instead, on the page that already holds the kind of credential you asked for —

| Your declaration | Where the unit is listed | What the page means |
|---|---|---|
| `Scope: extension.SecretScopeUser` | Settings → Connections | one member's own account somewhere; nobody else sees it |
| `Scope: extension.SecretScopeWorkspace` | Settings → Integrations | the installation's shared credential, curated by an operator |
| no `Secrets` at all | nowhere | nothing to manage, so nothing to list; `#/ext/<name>` still routes |

Two consequences worth knowing before you declare. **A unit declares ONE scope** — secrets spanning
both are refused at `make gen`, because a unit that is half a person's own account and half the
installation's has no honest page, and either tie-break hides one half from whoever holds the other.
Split the unit if you genuinely need both. And **the settings row is not a permission**: it carries no
grant of its own, exactly as the rail row it replaced did not. Your screen still gates itself on the
object it declares, and Settings → Integrations is additionally gated on the grants its own cards ask
for.

The four design-system gates (`ds-purity`, `icon-lint`, `ds-spacing`, `native-controls`) sweep your
unit exactly as they sweep core.

**Test your screen next to it.** A `*.test.tsx` under your `frontend/` is run by `make fe-test-ext`,
which `make check-fe` calls — a second vitest lane (`frontend/vitest.ext.config.ts`) rather than files
added to the core one, because a unit screen reads its copy through the merged catalogue and calls
routes that exist only in the merged contract, so its suite passes only against a composed tree. The
lane composes first. Declare `vitest`, `@testing-library/react` and friends in your own
`devDependencies`: the import gate lets a test file reach them and shipped code not.

**Ship your copy with your screen.** Put one flat JSON object per locale in
`frontend/i18n/<locale>.json`, keyed `ext<CamelUnit>.` — `extNotes.notes.add`. `<CamelUnit>` title-cases
each hyphen-separated segment, and marks a segment that starts with a DIGIT with a leading underscore
(`crm-2-x` → `extCrm_2X.`) so that two distinct unit names can never derive one prefix — `foo-1` and
`foo1` would otherwise both claim `extFoo1.`. The composer merges
them into the one catalogue, so `useT()` resolves your keys and core's through the same lookup. Supply
**every** locale the installation ships (en, de, vi) or generation refuses: a reader of the missing one
gets a blank screen. Keys outside your namespace are refused too — a unit does not rewrite core copy.

## Own scheduled jobs

Declare **two kinds** in `api/jobs.yaml`: a cadenced `dispatcher` that fans out over the live fleet, and a
`workspace` child (`<dispatcher>_ws`) that does one tenant's work. A single kind that both ticks and
carries a tenant is refused — it has no honest answer for whose data the tick touched. Use
`queue: default`; `queues` is not a container a fragment may extend.

Which half declares what is a rule, not a convention, and the composer refuses the other spellings:

- **`role` is `dispatcher` or `worker`, exactly.** A mistyped third value used to match neither
  arm of the pairing and quietly *un-declare* the kind: no registration, no manifest entry, no error.
- **Governance is the dispatcher's.** `tier` and `scope` go on the dispatcher and nowhere else — the
  pair resolves as one governed job, so a second copy on the child is a line an author writes, a
  reviewer reads, an operator resolves against, and the runtime never applies.
- **`cadence` is the dispatcher's; `max_attempts` is the child's.** A cadence on an enqueued worker and
  an attempt cap on a dispatcher are both refused; a dispatcher's retry *is* its next tick.
- **Both halves share one queue**, and the child's kind is the dispatcher's name plus `_ws` — a
  worker no dispatcher fans out to is one no clock ever reaches.

```go
Jobs: []extension.Job{{Name: "heartbeat", Handle: heartbeat}},
```

A job handler takes `(ctx, rt)` and no arguments — a tick has no caller. It cannot be confirm-first and
it cannot request an outbound scope; both are refused at boot.

> **Know before you ship a cadence:** a tick needs the workspace's agent seat to name its initiator.
> Bootstrap writes one, so a fresh installation runs your job — but an operator who archives or
> deactivates that seat silently stops every scheduled job at once. Such a workspace is **skipped**,
> and the count is reported as `margince_extension_job_seatless_workspaces` on the worker's
> `/metrics`. Do not treat a silent job as a broken one without reading that gauge first.

## React to events

A `Subscription` names the event types the unit listens for and the function one delivery runs:

```go
Subscriptions: []extension.Subscription{
	{Name: "withdraw_filing", Events: []string{"activity.archived"}, Handle: withdrawFiling},
},
```

```go
func withdrawFiling(ctx context.Context, rt extension.Runtime, d extension.Delivery) error
```

`Delivery` carries the event id, its type, when it occurred, the entity it names, and the raw payload.
Each subscription gets its own consumer group (`cg:ext-<unit>-<subscription>`), started in the worker
role. What to design for:

- **A delivery has nobody behind it.** The caller is the zero `Caller`, so `tx.Core()` refuses. Your
  own tables stay writable, auditable and publishable.
- **The bus is at-least-once.** The core suppresses the redelivery it can see (the same event to the
  same subscription), but that is a cache and it cannot cover a crash between your effect and the ack.
  Make the handler safe to run twice, keyed on `EventID`.
- **Your return value decides redelivery.** An error leaves the entry pending and it comes back; `nil`
  acks it. So a delivery you can never process — a malformed payload, a subject you do not recognise —
  returns `nil` and logs, rather than failing forever on something no retry can fix.
- **A type nothing can route is refused at boot**, rather than registering a consumer group that never
  delivers. You may name a core type or another unit's (`ext_<namespace>.<verb>`).
- **The list is public.** It derives into `manifest.generated.json`, so which of the installation's
  facts your unit consumes is readable without opening its source.

## Capture records from your own provider

Declare the providers you bring records in from. `System` is the unit's own stable key for the
provider, and the core stamps it into every landed record's provenance:

```go
Ingress: []extension.IngressSource{{
	System: "relay",                                      // lower kebab, ≤32 chars, STABLE
	Lands:  []extension.RecordKind{extension.KindActivity},
	Merges: []extension.MergeKey{extension.MergeKeyEmail}, // optional; see below
}},
```

Then hand one record at a time to the core's own capture pipeline:

```go
res, err := rt.Ingest(ctx, member, rec) // res.Disposition is Accepted or Skipped
```

You assemble no timeline entry and could not — you hand over a record and the core decides what
becomes of it. The rules that will otherwise bite:

- **`Ingest` hangs off `Runtime`, not `Tx`.** The pipeline opens its own transaction, so calling it
  from inside yours takes a second connection while holding one — on a small pool that hangs rather
  than fails. `ErrNestedIngest` makes it a sentence instead.
- **Unattended only.** An ingest from an invocation that has a caller is refused
  (`ErrAttendedIngest`): two authorities would be in play. Do it from your job tick.
- **You act for a member, on their live authority.** The member named in `on` must currently hold one
  of your unit's user-scoped secrets — depositing a credential is the act that says "act for me here".
  A member demoted since they connected narrows what their connection can land, from the next call on.
- **`Key` must be identical on every re-read.** It is the idempotency key. Derive it from the
  provider's own id, never from a timestamp, a page position or your own row id — the failure mode is a
  duplicate on every poll, and **nothing reports an error**.
- **Both dispositions advance your cursor.** `Skipped` means the core deliberately kept nothing and
  logged why (a wholly-internal message). Treating it as a failure retries a deliberate drop forever.
- **`Merges` is what your source VOUCHES for**, and it is empty by default. Declare
  `MergeKeyEmail` only if your provider's address for a person is authoritative — a directory your
  administrator maintains, not a string the user typed about themselves. It lets an address carried
  alongside a channel account be *matched* on, so a colleague already captured from mail is recognised
  instead of becoming a second contact. Without the declaration, a record carrying both is refused at
  the gate.

Supply every field your provider gives you and decide nothing about identity: which fields the core's
resolution ladder may match on is the core's call, read from your declaration. What each field must
contain, and what breaks when it does not, is the connector contract in
[explanation/ingress-gate-and-auto-capture.md](../explanation/ingress-gate-and-auto-capture.md).

## Carry replies — supply a transport

A `Channel` declares a messaging provider your unit can carry messages on, so a rep's reply to a
conversation you captured leaves through your unit rather than a surface of your own:

```go
Channels: []extension.Channel{{Provider: "relay", Send: send, Live: live}},
```

```go
func send(ctx context.Context, rt extension.Runtime, msg extension.OutboundMessage) (extension.Receipt, error)
func live(ctx context.Context, rt extension.Runtime, member extension.UserID) (bool, error)
```

**Your unit never sends on its own initiative — it declares a transport and the core calls it.** A
human stages the message through the timeline reply box, the seat gate re-reads them, and the
dispatcher then hands you an `OutboundMessage` (the member to send as, the recipient's channel
identity, the body, what it replies to, and an idempotency key). Return a `Receipt` naming the
provider's own message id. The tier's outbound refusals are untouched by this: you still may not spend
an outbound cap from a tool or a job tick.

- **`Provider` takes `channel_provider`'s grammar, which is SNAKE** (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`, ≤32) — not
  the ingress system's kebab. `deal-room` is a legal ingress system and an illegal provider.
- **`Live` is required whenever `Send` is present.** It answers, for one member and *without spending
  the credential*, whether the connection is still usable. Answer `false` for a confirmed "no" — the
  delivery parks where a human can see it. Return an **error** when you could not tell — it is
  retried. Collapsing the two either strands a message or sends it twice.
- **A nil `Send` is the capture-only case**, and it is documented rather than accidental: a reply
  attempt is answered with the deployment fact instead of a fault.
- **You name the transport, never the activity kind.** A message you file lands as `message` with your
  provider on the transport column; the kind is the core's (ADR-0107/A158).
- **You cannot shadow a core provider.** Declaring `telegram` fails the boot: every Telegram reply
  would otherwise leave on your per-member credential instead of the workspace's bot, which looks
  identical on screen.

Set `Activity.ChannelProvider` on the records you capture on that transport — a message with no
transport cannot be replied to on anything, and the gate refuses it.

## Write the unit's own test

Each unit is its own Go module, so the backend's `./...` never reaches it — it carries its own tests,
run by `make test-extensions` on the composed workspace. Its Go files sit under the same
craftsmanship and license-header gates as `backend/` — `make craft-static` sweeps `extensions/`, and
the pre-push hook checks the extension files a push changes. Pin the statutory content so a changed span
or class name is a deliberate, reviewed edit (copy the shape from `extensions/de/de_test.go`):

```go
func TestNewDeclaresTheFloors(t *testing.T) {
	e := New()
	if e.Name != "fr" {
		t.Fatalf("Name = %q, want fr", e.Name)
	}
	// … assert the pack code, class names, and calendar spans.
}
```

A test with no assertion is noise (P3, tests-as-spec) — assert the actual floors, not just that `New()` returns.

## Compose and verify

Because presence is enablement, the moment the directory exists it's in the enabled set — you only
have to regenerate the composition and run the gates:

1. **`make composition`** — regenerates `build/composition/` from `extensions/`; your unit now appears
   in the generated `Extensions()`, and a `manifest.generated.json` lands next to your unit — the
   statically derived record of the **risk tiers** it requests (the 🟢/🟡 operations and scopes an
   operator must approve under §7; a jurisdiction-only unit requests none, so its list is empty).
   — plus what the unit **reaches**: its `secrets`, `subscriptions`, `ingress` (with the identity keys
   the source vouches for) and `channels` (with `supplies_transport`).
   Commit it with the unit; the drift gate fails a stale or hand-edited one. Derivation reads your
   `New()` from the AST, so the returned `extension.Extension` literal and every field it derives must
   be literal values or the published `extension` constants (`extension.TierAutoExecute`,
   `extension.ScopeRead`, `extension.MergeKeyEmail`, …) — a computed value, or a field the generator
   does not recognize, fails generation with the file and line rather than silently dropping a
   request. This is why a connector spells its provider string twice — once in `Ingress`, once in
   `Channels` — rather than sharing a constant: the reader resolves none. Pin the two equal with a
   test. (Every build/test lane depends on this target, so `make check` runs it for
   you; run it directly when you want to inspect the output.)
2. **`make check`** — builds the composed workspace, runs the extension-tier fitness tests
   (import-boundary, marker placement, composition wiring), `make test-extensions` (your unit's own
   tests), and `make check-composition` (a clean regeneration must reproduce `composition.json`
   byte-for-byte).
3. **Boot a role** — `make dev`, then confirm the boot doesn't abort: a duplicate code, an unknown
   class, or a bad period is caught in `RegisterExtensions`' validate phase *before* any surface
   serves, and names the offending unit.

   `make dev` runs the **composed** stack on both sides: it materializes `build/composition/`, builds
   the api and worker against the composed `GOWORK`, and starts Vite with
   `MARGINCE_COMPOSITION_FRONTEND` pointing at the composed frontend registry — so a unit's routes,
   its agent tools *and* `#/ext/<name>` are all live on the one port `make dev` prints. (It did not
   set that variable until Task 14's UAT found the gap: only the web image build did, so the SPA
   resolved the empty-tree registry and every unit route answered "no extension named …" while the
   api served it perfectly.)

   A **scheduled job** needs the workspace's agent seat, which bootstrap writes. A database
   bootstrapped before that landed gets it from the `0216_agent_seat_backfill` migration, so run
   `make migrate` before wondering why a tick never fires.

Push only once `make check` is **green** — not red, not still running. The vanilla stub check keeps
passing because it's keyed on the *empty* `extensions/` tree; your unit only changes the composed
output, never the committed `composition/` stub.

## Ship it

**A new unit's directory is gitignored.** `.gitignore` ignores `/extensions/*` except an explicit
allowlist (`!/extensions/de`, …), so a first-party unit you mean to ship in the vanilla tree **must
add its own exception** — `!/extensions/<name>` — or the PR opens with no extension files, and files
you add to the unit later are silently ignored too. (`git add -f` stages the files once but leaves the
directory ignored, so it is not a substitute for the exception.) A purely local, per-installation unit
is *meant* to stay ignored: its presence in the working tree already enables it for that install.

**Removing a unit is a removal in ONE place** — the unit's own directory. Use `git rm`, not `mv` or
`rm`: `make drift` compares the working tree against the INDEX, so an unstaged deletion of the
committed `manifest.generated.json` fails the gate on a removal that is otherwise correct.

Then commit **the complete unit directory** — every source and test file plus its module metadata
(`go.mod`, and `go.sum` if it carries third-party dependencies) — together with the `.gitignore`
exception. Do **not** commit `build/composition/` — it is generated and ignored — and leave the
tracked `composition/` stub unchanged unless you are deliberately changing the vanilla baseline. Sign
off every commit (`git commit -s`), then the usual PR loop ([CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md));
merge only when the gates are green.

**Removal is the unit's directory and nothing else**, and this is the whole recipe — run end to end
against `notes`, with the gate green afterwards:

```bash
git rm -r extensions/<name>
rm -rf extensions/<name>   # the IGNORED install output git rm leaves behind
pnpm install               # prune the workspace member from the lockfile
make check-q
```

The `rm -rf` is not tidiness: `git rm` takes the tracked files and leaves `node_modules`, so the
directory survives holding nothing a human wrote — and presence under `extensions/` IS enablement, so
the composer still sees a unit. It says exactly that if you forget.

`git rm`, never `mv`: a moved directory is still a directory under `extensions/`.

No core file is edited, and no core TEST needs touching. Removal
*disables* cleanly — routes 404, the inventory omits the unit, migrations skip it — but it does **not
purge**: the unit's tables and rows, its `extension_secret` rows and any grants of its RBAC objects
inside `role.permissions` all survive. There is no purge primitive yet (#628).
