# Configuration reference

Three process-role binaries live under `backend/cmd/`. Configuration is
flags; where a flag has an environment fallback it is listed. An empty
required value is a boot error, as is an invalid `--log-level` /
`--log-format`.

**One installation serves one organization** (A107/ADR-0061). No request selects
a tenant — the server resolves its singleton organization itself, so a call
carries only the caller's own credential: a `crm_session` cookie for a human, a
bearer passport for an agent or an MCP client. A worked first call is in
[tutorials/getting-started.md](../tutorials/getting-started.md).


## Common log flags (api, worker)

| Flag | Env | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--log-level` | `MARGINCE_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `--log-format` | `MARGINCE_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` (slog text), `json` |

Both roles log to stdout, and their log lines carry the per-request
`correlation_id` via the correlation slog wrapper. `cmd/migrate` takes neither
flag: it writes confirmations to stdout and failures to stderr, with no
configurable logger.

## cmd/api — the HTTP process role

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dsn` | `MARGINCE_DSN` | — (required) | Postgres DSN, runtime app role |
| `--config` | `MARGINCE_CONFIG` | `margince.yaml` | the deployment configuration file (bootstrap + auth — organization, bootstrap_admin, seeds, email; strict decoding, secrets as `*_file` references). A missing file boots an existing installation; bootstrapping an empty database requires `organization` + `bootstrap_admin` |
| `--schema-dsn` | `MARGINCE_SCHEMA_DSN` | — | Postgres DSN, **owner** role, for the customfields runtime-DDL pool; unset = `createCustomField`/`updateCustomFieldOptions` answer 501 |
| `--addr` | — | `:8080` | listen address |
| `--redis` | `MARGINCE_REDIS` | `localhost:16379` | Redis address (event bus). May name a logical database as `host:port/N` (0–15) — see below |
| `--inline-relay` | — | `true` | run the outbox relay in-process; set `false` when `cmd/worker` runs it |
| `--webhook-key` | `MARGINCE_WEBHOOK_KEY` | — | base64 32-byte key sealing outbound-webhook signing secrets at rest; unset = the mutating `/webhook-subscriptions` paths (create/rotate, replay) answer 503, never an unsigned fallback; the read surface still lists |
| `--geocode-base-url` | `MARGINCE_GEOCODE_BASE_URL` | — | Nominatim base URL, on the worker role. Unset = no geocoding: company addresses keep no coordinates and every `within_radius` query answers unavailable. `public` uses OpenStreetMap's own service, which is POC-only — its terms hold a client that runs on a schedule to 4 requests a minute, single-threaded, with caching, so any real volume wants a self-hosted instance. |
| `--vat-check-base-url` | `MARGINCE_VAT_CHECK_BASE_URL` | — | VIES base URL, on the worker role. Unset = no VAT checking: a company's VAT ID is stored as its imprint stated it and claims nothing more. `public` uses the Commission's own service, whose terms describe occasional verification rather than bulk lookup — one worker, paced, is what this installation is entitled to. |
| `--vat-check-requester` | `MARGINCE_VAT_CHECK_REQUESTER` | — | This installation's OWN VAT ID (e.g. `DE123456789`), on the worker role. VIES issues a consultation number — the receipt a business shows to say it verified a counterpart before treating a supply as intra-community — only for a check made under a requester's number. Unset still checks and still answers; the answer just carries no proof. |
| `--certlog-base-url` | `MARGINCE_CERTLOG_BASE_URL` | — | certificate-transparency base URL, on the worker role. It enables the whole technical lookup — what a company publicly runs, read from its DNS records, its certificate history and one polite fetch of its own homepage. Unset = the lane is off: the company record keeps no technical profile and the button on it answers 501, which is honest for an installation that should make no outbound lookups. `public` uses crt.sh, which is free and needs no key but is one small service run on goodwill — the reader paces itself to one query every five seconds and caches every answer for that reason. |
| `--technical-backfill-interval` | — | `6h` | how often the worker looks for companies whose technical profile is missing or stale. Unlike geocoding there is no write to trigger on — a company's mail provider changes at the COMPANY — so this pass is the only thing that ever observes a move. Runs on start; `0` turns the sweep off and leaves the button working. |
| `--metrics-token` | `MARGINCE_METRICS_TOKEN` | — | shared secret `/metrics` requires as a Bearer credential. This is the access control the fleet-wide-exposition note below calls for: unset (the default) `/metrics` answers **404**, rather than serving per-workspace job telemetry to anyone who asks. Set it wherever the scraper can present it |
| `--hubspot-app-secret` | `MARGINCE_HUBSPOT_APP_SECRET` | — | the HubSpot app client secret. Verifies inbound overlay-webhook v3 signatures and, when set, mounts `/webhooks/hubspot`; unset, that route is absent rather than present-and-unverified |
| `--ai-routing` | `MARGINCE_AI_ROUTING` | — | **ignored, and warns.** The binding is a stored setting: declared for a fresh install under `seeds.ai_routing` in `margince.yaml`, changed on a running one through Settings → AI / `PUT /v1/ai/routing`, no restart — with one exception: a role that STARTED with nothing bound wired no model path, so it has no watcher to notice the first binding and must be restarted once after it is saved. The flag stays registered so an existing command line does not die on an unknown one; nothing reads a routing file any more. What a bound installation lights up is unchanged: the cold-start read-back, per-org enrichment, the Morning-Brief L2 re-order, and AI-drafted offer regeneration |
| `--ai-fake` | — | `false` | offline fake model (dev/test only), and a FALLBACK rather than an override: a servable stored binding outranks it and the flag is then inert. It serves when nothing is bound — or when the stored binding cannot be built, which is how a keyless dev stack still starts instead of refusing on a missing credential |
| `--public-base-url` | `MARGINCE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | — | canonical external scheme+host for buyer-facing links (RFC 8058 unsubscribe / preference center); required to send marketing mail — a send refuses rather than derive the token-bearing link from the request Host — and for the Gmail/Graph OAuth callback. **Held to an address a RECIPIENT can open** whenever a real sender is configured (SMTP `email.enabled`, or a Gmail/Graph app): https only, and not localhost, a private address or an interface-scoped one. `MARGINCE_ENV=dev` or `test` admits the dev stack's `http://localhost`. Both the api and the worker refuse to boot on an unusable value, and a tokenized send refuses at send time; the configured value and whether it last answered are shown on Settings → Connections |
| — (env-only) | `MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT` | `0` (uncapped) | same knob `cmd/worker` reads (below) — `cmd/api` also boots on it (an invalid value is a boot error here too) so the on-connect/Connect-time seeding path sees the same cap the periodic sweep does |
| — (env-only) | `MARGINCE_PROVIDER_SURFE` | `off` | which licensed-data-provider adapter this process carries: `off` registers none (every provider surface answers honestly and no code path can reach a vendor — PI-AC-9), `offline` the deterministic fake for a dev stack, `live` the real Surfe adapter. **Both `cmd/api` and `cmd/worker` read it and must agree**: the api queues a run and the worker executes it, so a split setting would submit to one vendor and poll another. An unknown value is a boot error rather than a silent `off` — a typo must not quietly disable a feature an operator asked for, or quietly enable egress. Needs a configured keyvault; without one the provider surface stays absent |
| `--oauth-access-token-ttl` | `MARGINCE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` | `0` (= the passport default, 720h / 30 days) | lifetime of the access token the MCP connector's OAuth handshake mints. That token IS an Agent Seat Passport, so unset it inherits the 30-day passport default, while connector norms are ~15 minutes plus refresh; set e.g. `15m` to run those norms without a code change — the refresh-rotation machinery is what makes a short lifetime cheap for a client. It applies to **both** mints of a connection's life, the code exchange and every rotation. Maximum `2160h` (90 days, the mint's own ceiling); an out-of-range or non-duration value is a boot error, never a silent default |

With `--inline-relay` (the default) an unreachable Redis fails the boot:
without a relay every committed write would strand its outbox row.

Operational endpoints (served next to `/v1`):

- `/healthz` — liveness: a dumb 200 (a database outage must not
  restart-loop the process).
- `/readyz` — readiness: every dependency probe (Postgres; Redis too
  when the relay is inline; the object store when a blobstore is
  configured; the secret vault when a keyvault is configured; the
  customfields schema pool when `--schema-dsn` is set) must pass within
  2s, else 503 naming the unready dependency.
- `/metrics` — Prometheus text format: `margince_outbox_unpublished`,
  `margince_relay_published_total`, `margince_pgxpool_conns{state=…}`, the
  AI router's counters, the overlay sync-health section, and the
  **job-runtime section** below. Gated by `--metrics-token`: without one the
  route answers 404, so a deployment that wants scraping must set the token and
  give it to the scraper.
- `GET /v1/admin/job-health` — the per-workspace read of the same job
  table, for an admin rather than a scrape. See
  [Reading the job surfaces](#reading-the-job-surfaces).
- `/mcp` plus `/oauth/*` and the RFC 8414/9728 discovery documents
  (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and its `/mcp` suffixed form) —
  the remote MCP connector, mounted as ONE group only when the
  deployment file sets `mcp.connector_enabled: true`. They share the api
  origin because RFC 9728 discovery is a chain rooted at the resource
  server's 401, which a split origin breaks. The gate also requires
  `--public-base-url`: it is a boot error without one, because the
  advertised resource is an audience decision and must never be derived
  from the request `Host`. With the gate off — the code default — none of
  those routes exists and each answers 404, so an installation that has
  not declared the connector exposes no client registration and no
  token endpoint. The shipped example config declares the gate on, which
  is why a `make dev` stack serves the connector with no edit; the boot
  error is what keeps that a local convenience rather than an accidental
  exposure.

  Both discovery documents advertise `scopes_supported`, derived from the
  one closed passport vocabulary: the protected resource names the five
  record verbs (`read`, `draft`, `write`, `send`, `enrich`), and the
  authorization server names those plus `offline_access`, which buys token
  lifetime rather than access to a record. What a connection is granted is the
  scopes the human ticked on the consent screen, not what the client
  requested — these documents state the vocabulary a client may name, they do
  not bound the grant.

### Reading the job surfaces

Two readers over one table, `river_job`, answering two different questions.
Both are served by `cmd/api`, and both are read at request time rather than
counted in process: the job table is fleet-wide, so a counter kept inside
`cmd/worker` would be invisible to every scrape of the api while the api's own
copy reported a truthful-looking zero. That stays true — the worker never
re-serves a job-table gauge, and `--observe-addr` below is about the process,
not the fleet.

**`/metrics` — is a queue growing?** Nine gauge families over the job table:

| Family | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `margince_job_queue_depth` | `queue`, `workspace_id` | available + scheduled + retryable + pending — work nobody has done yet (OPS-MET-2) |
| `margince_job_running` | `queue`, `workspace_id` | currently executing |
| `margince_job_discarded` | `kind`, `workspace_id` | every attempt spent; will never run without intervention |
| `margince_job_cancelled` | `kind`, `workspace_id` | stopped deliberately, attempts unspent — counted apart from discarded because the operator story differs, not because it is less dead. The sweep pair counts either as a workspace missed |
| `margince_job_oldest_queued_age_seconds` | `queue`, `workspace_id` | how long the oldest runnable-and-unclaimed job has waited |
| `margince_sweep_workspaces` | `sweep` | workspaces with a surviving child of that fleet pass |
| `margince_sweep_workspaces_failed` | `sweep` | those whose MOST RECENT child is discarded or cancelled |
| `margince_sweep_units` | `sweep`, `unit` | the same reading one grain down, for the dispatchers that fan out per **connection** or per **build**: units with a surviving child |
| `margince_sweep_units_failed` | `sweep`, `unit` | those whose MOST RECENT child is discarded or cancelled |

The last two exist because the workspace pair counts each workspace once, and
four dispatchers fan out below that grain. They report **only** the kinds whose
declared `fan_out_unit` is finer than a workspace — for the other twenty the
unit *is* the workspace, so the two pairs would carry the same numbers.

The two families **overlap rather than partition**: a per-connection kind is
reported by both, at two grains, because its rows carry a workspace id as well
as a connection id. That is the point — the coarse reading answers *is every
tenant covered*, the fine one answers *did every unit of the pass run* — but it
means **never sum them**. `margince_sweep_units_failed{sweep="telegram_poll"}`
and `margince_sweep_workspaces_failed{sweep="telegram_poll"}` can both be
non-zero for one dead connection. Alert on whichever grain you mean; use
`... > 0 or ... > 0` if you want either to page you, never `+`.

The `sweep` label on both pairs is the **child** kind, not the dispatcher's —
`sweep="telegram_poll"`, not `telegram_poll_sweep` — because the child is what
the rows hold, and mapping back to the dispatcher would be a hand-kept table.
That matters for a dashboard: joining a sweep series to
`margince_job_declared_info` on the kind lands on the CHILD's catalogue entry,
which carries no `fan_out_unit` — that label is declared on the dispatcher. The
unit pair carries its grain in its own `unit` label for exactly that reason, so
no join is needed to read it.

A tenth, `margince_job_unrecognised_state{state,queue,workspace_id}`,
appears **only when it has something to report**: work sitting in a state
this exposition does not classify. It is a signal to investigate, not a
series to graph, which is why it is absent rather than zero the rest of the
time.

Two more families read the **declaration** — `backend/api/jobs.yaml`, where
every job kind this build runs is declared — rather than the job table. Every
gauge above is a projection of `river_job` at scrape time, so it can only name
a kind that happens to have rows, and that collapses three different situations
into one absence: a declared kind running idle, a kind nobody ever wired, and
rows of a kind the contract no longer declares.

| Family | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `margince_job_declared_info` | `kind`, `role`, `queue`, `fan_out_unit`, `timeout_seconds` | one series per DECLARED kind, valued 1 — the catalogue, written whether or not the job table holds a row of that kind |
| `margince_job_unrecognised_kind` | `kind` | rows whose kind the contract does not declare — a retired kind outliving itself in River's retention. Present only when such work exists |

Between them the three states are told apart: a kind in the catalogue with no
depth series is idle, a kind absent from the catalogue with rows is retired,
and a kind in neither was never wired at all. Join an alert against
`margince_job_declared_info` rather than assuming a missing depth series means
zero work.

Its labels are the declaration's, and a label the declaration does not actually
**govern** is omitted rather than filled in — a published number is one an
alert will act on:

- `queue` is absent where a kind's insert options belong to its callers rather
  than to the contract. The file records a queue for every kind but binds one
  only where it supplies the options; a caller-owned kind takes its queue from
  scattered enqueue sites, and publishing that number would reintroduce the
  declared-versus-actual drift this surface exists to detect.
- `timeout_seconds` is `-1` where the kind deliberately runs with **no**
  deadline (the two embed passes, which are bounded by their backlog and must
  stay outside River's rescuer), and **absent** where the wall clock is an
  operator's dial computed at the worker's registration — the file calls that
  one "not knowable here at all", and a guess would be worse than silence.
  It is never `0`: zero is River's silent one-minute default wearing the same
  digits as a deliberate absence, and telling those two apart is what the
  declaration is for.
- `fan_out_unit` says what ONE child of a dispatcher stands for — a workspace,
  a connection, or a build — and is absent for a kind that fans out to nothing.

Three further things the declaration states that no gauge can, worth knowing
when you read a kind's row in `river_job`:

- **Every kind has a CHOSEN timeout.** A kind with none fails generation rather
  than running on River's one-minute default, and a worker cannot answer for
  its own wall clock: the declared value is what River is handed.
- **`fault:` says whether a worker may log a failure and return nil.** Omitted —
  the case for all but four kinds — it may not, so a green row means the work
  succeeded. The four that declare it name the durable retry policy that makes
  the green row honest (a connector sidecar's backoff, a run row's own state),
  and for those a completed job means "this attempt is concluded", not "the
  work succeeded".
- **`args:` says what each field of a kind's payload carries.** River persists
  args verbatim in a table with no workspace column, so a job names
  a row and the worker reads it: every field is declared an id, or waived as a
  scalar with the reason a value that is not an id is safe there — and a field
  whose *name* reads like content (`Body`, `Subject`, `RecipientEmail`) owes a
  written reason even when it is an id, which is the one thing a reviewer is
  forced to argue rather than assume. Reading a job's args in an incident
  should therefore never turn up message bodies or addresses — if it does, that
  is the defect, not the payload.

Four things worth knowing before you build an alert on these:

- **An empty `workspace_id` means a dispatcher**, exactly and in both
  directions — where *empty* means the `workspace_id` key is **absent or
  JSON null** in the job's args, which is what a fan-out job's args look
  like. A job that does tenant work always names its workspace.
  A row whose key is *present but an empty string* is neither: it is
  malformed, and appears under `workspace_id="malformed_workspace_id"` so it
  is visible as the anomaly it is rather than being counted as dispatcher
  work. A job that does tenant work declares its workspace, so a null
  there is a fan-out job and nothing else. The label carries the **id**,
  never a name: the exposition endpoint has no redaction path.
- **A job scheduled for the future is counted in depth but contributes no
  age.** It is queued, but it is not late. A queue holding nothing but running or
  discarded rows reports no age series at all — a running job has already
  been claimed and a discarded one never will be, so neither is what
  "oldest runnable-and-unclaimed" measures. The endpoint reports `null` for
  the same rows.
- **The sweep pair is per workspace, not per pass.** There is no such thing
  as "the last pass" in this table: River resolves a uniqueness conflict by
  updating the existing row, so a child still active from the previous
  fan-out is deduplicated and writes no new row. Any batch-keyed reading
  would report a dispatcher retried mid-fleet as covering a fraction of the
  workspaces it actually covers. Instead, each workspace's most recent child
  of that kind is what counts.
- **A sweep series can shrink or vanish because of River's retention,** not
  because the fleet shrank: the cleaner deletes finalized rows on its own
  schedule. An absent series is the honest answer — a fabricated zero would
  be indistinguishable from "the fleet is empty".
- **Both `_failed` halves see only what River sees.** They count rows that ended
  `discarded` or `cancelled`. A kind whose worker deliberately records its own
  failure and returns `nil` — declared as `fault.nil_after_logging` in
  `backend/api/jobs.yaml`, and true of `capture_sync` and `voice_build`, whose
  retry cadence belongs to their own sidecar rather than to River — completes
  green, so a handled failure of one of those does not reach either pair. For
  those kinds a zero here means "River saw no dead rows", not "nothing failed";
  their own domain state is the authority. This is a property of the sweep
  reading as a whole, not of the per-unit half.
- **The per-workspace pair reads one grain too coarse for four dispatchers,**
  and that is what `margince_sweep_units_*` is for. Gmail sync, Gmail watch and
  the Telegram poll fan out per **connection**; the voice-build retry fans out
  per **build**. A workspace holding two connections produces two children per
  pass, and if the broken one failed before the healthy one succeeded, that
  workspace's most recent child is the successful one — so the workspace pair
  reports zero failures while a connection is dead. The unit pair counts each
  connection in its own right and reports the failure. Read the workspace pair
  for fleet coverage and the unit pair for whether every unit of a pass ran;
  neither replaces the other, and the four finer-grained kinds appear in both —
  see the note above on never summing them.

**`/metrics` is fleet-wide; the endpoint is not.** The exposition carries
every workspace's id and every kind, because an operator scraping a service
is outside the tenant boundary by construction (ADR-0080/A125 admits the id
for exactly this reason, and only the id). That is a deliberate asymmetry
with the admin endpoint below, which is scoped — so `/metrics` must stay
behind the same access control as any other operator surface, never proxied
to a tenant.

**`GET /v1/admin/job-health` — whose work died, and why?** Admin-only and
human-session-only; an agent passport is refused at the middleware and again
in the handler. It reports, for each kind, the waiting/running/retrying/dead
counts and the oldest waiting age, plus up to 50 recent failures.

- **It is scoped to the caller's own workspace plus the untenanted
  dispatcher rows, never the fleet.** `river_job` has no workspace column, so
  the handler imposes the scope itself. The
  untenanted arm is a closed set of declared dispatcher kinds — an
  unrecognised untenanted row is omitted rather than shared.
- **The failure `reason` is the job layer's own vetted sentence.**
  `river_job.errors` holds whatever a worker returned, and a worker that
  bypassed the fault seam stored its raw cause — which routinely names an
  address or record a provider refused. Anything not in the closed
  vocabulary is replaced by one fixed substitute. River's stored panic trace
  is never read at all. A row that recorded no cause at all — a job cancelled
  before it ran — says so, rather than borrowing the unvettable-failure
  sentence and claiming a failure that never happened.

## cmd/worker — the background process role

**Outbound mail does not leave without this process.** Every role that accepts
a send stages it — the api's HTTP handler and the MCP `send_email` tool — but
only `cmd/worker` registers the worker that transmits (`comms_send_email`). In an api-only deployment an accepted send is
recorded on the timeline, answers `202`, and then sits `pending` in
`comms_outbound` indefinitely with no reason string, because nothing has yet
tried and failed. Run a worker, or accept that mail is queued and not sent.

**The weekly retrospective's mail leaves from here too, and it needs `email` in
the deployment file.** The api role has always resolved the relay because the
mail it sends answers a request — a password reset, a Deal Room invitation. The
weekly review is the first message this product sends that nobody asked for in
the moment, and it is written by an unattended job, so the worker resolves the
same relay and the same sealed `email.smtp.password` for itself. A worker booted
without `email.enabled` measures every rep's week and mails none; the review is
on Home either way, and the boot line says which posture this process is in.

**One attempt per rep per week, and the column says so.** `weekly_review.mail_attempted_at`
is written *before* the relay is dialled, so every later tick of the six-hourly
pass finds the attempt spent and sends nothing. That bounds duplicates at the
cost of losing the message on any post-claim failure — a crash, a refused
envelope, a connection dropped mid-body. The name is deliberate: SMTP returns no
receipt this installation records, so nothing here observed a delivery, and a
column called `sent_at` would claim one. When the relay refuses, the cause lands
in `weekly_review.mail_error` beside the stamp, so a missing weekly is
answerable from the row rather than only from a log nobody kept. Set
`--public-base-url` on the worker as well, or the message goes out without its
link back to Home.

**A failed outbound webhook is never re-attempted without this process either.**
Both roles run the `cg:webhooks` consumer when `--webhook-key` is set, so an
api-only deployment still makes each delivery's FIRST attempt — but the retry
sweep is a River periodic job (`webhook_retry` → one `webhook_retry_workspace`
row per live workspace) and only `cmd/worker` runs a River runner. In an api-only
deployment a delivery that fails its first attempt sits `retrying` forever, never
reaching its 6-attempt budget and so never reaching `dead_lettered` either. The
api's boot line says so; `cmd/worker` is load-bearing for E10 retry. See
[explanation/outbound-webhooks.md](../explanation/outbound-webhooks.md#6-the-two-runtime-lanes-and-where-they-run).

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dsn` | `MARGINCE_DSN` | — (required) | Postgres DSN, runtime app role |
| `--public-base-url` | `MARGINCE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | — | canonical external scheme+host for buyer-facing links (RFC 8058 unsubscribe / preference center); required for a marketing send originated by this role's Surface-B agent run — without it that send refuses rather than emit a forgeable link |
| `--config` | `MARGINCE_CONFIG` | `margince.yaml` | the deployment configuration file; the worker reads it for the `ai.capture_payloads` posture the Surface-B runner honors (capture applies to **both** the api and worker roles — the worker runs the richest content source, the agent runs). A missing file boots with capture off |
| `--redis` | `MARGINCE_REDIS` | `localhost:16379` | Redis address (event bus). May name a logical database as `host:port/N` (0–15) — see below |
| `--ai-routing` | `MARGINCE_AI_ROUTING` | — | **ignored, and warns** — see the api row. A bound installation runs the Surface-B runner + embeddings from the database, and this role re-reads that stored binding on an interval so it never serves one the api has replaced |
| `--ai-fake` | — | `false` | run the Surface-B runner on the offline fake model |
| `--runner-interval` | — | `30s` | Surface-B scheduler tick — the River periodic schedule of the `agent_scheduler` dispatcher, which enqueues one `agent_scheduler_workspace` job per live workspace. It paces the fan-out, not an agent's own schedule: the catalog's daily due hour decides when a brief runs |
| `--retention-interval` | — | `24h` | retention evaluator pass interval — the River periodic schedule of the `privacy_retention` dispatcher, which enqueues one `privacy_retention_workspace` job per workspace |
| `--time-scan-interval` | — | `1h` | clock-trigger automation scan interval (`no_activity_reminder` et al.) — the River periodic schedule of the `time_scan` dispatcher, which enqueues one `time_scan_workspace` job per live workspace |
| `--close-date-interval` | — | `24h` | close-date hygiene sweep interval (INV-CLOSE-PAST) |
| `--webhook-key` | `MARGINCE_WEBHOOK_KEY` | — | base64 32-byte key sealing outbound-webhook signing secrets; unset = the delivery worker stays off (no `cg:webhooks` consumer, no retry sweep) |
| `--webhook-retry-interval` | — | `30s` | how often the outbound-webhook retry dispatcher fans one due-retry pass out per live workspace (worker role only) |
| `--reconcile-interval` | — | `24h` | overnight follow-up reconciliation pass interval |
| `--overlay-reconcile-interval` | — | `2m` | overlay-mode incumbent mirror sweep interval. Every tick spends incumbent API quota per object class even when nothing changed (9 classes ≈ 11 REST calls/tick against HubSpot's 90k/day), so lengthen it on a dev box. `POST /overlay/reconcile` ("Sync now") only marks the workspace due — the sweep still waits for the next tick, so a long interval makes that button feel slow |
| `--overlay-backfill-limit` | `MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT` | `0` (uncapped) | cap the overlay INITIAL mirror backfill at N records per object class — dev/demo, so connecting a real portal doesn't pull it all onto a laptop. Only the backfill is capped: later incremental sweeps still bring in anything edited after the sweep window, which opens shortly before the connect instant (a clock-skew grace). A class the cap actually cuts short reports `backfillComplete: false` permanently (`overlay_backfill_cursor.truncated`) — unsetting the limit does NOT resume it, since the cursor is already `done`; reset that class's `overlay_backfill_cursor` row (or reconnect, which purges it) to backfill it for real. Don't change the limit mid-backfill either — the running count rides in `overlay_backfill_cursor` as a `<count>\|<inner>` prefix the uncapped adapter rejects, which fails that class every sweep until the cursor row is cleared |
| `--send-rate-limit` | — | `0` (= built-in 30) | outbound messages ONE mailbox may transmit per `--send-rate-window`. Burst pacing, not a quota: the provider enforces its own daily cap and throttles an account that bursts past it. The limiter is in-process, so a multi-worker deployment paces each replica's view of the mailbox independently |
| `--send-rate-window` | — | `0` (= built-in 1m) | the window the per-mailbox send rate is measured over |
| `--send-max-age` | — | `0` (= built-in 24h) | how long a staged send may be deferred by the pacing chain before it parks with a reason instead. Without a bound a permanently saturated policy would defer a message forever, silently |
| `--deepread-max-pages` | `MARGINCE_DEEPREAD_MAX_PAGES` | `0` (= built-in 40) | deep-read crawl page cap |
| `--deepread-max-bytes` | `MARGINCE_DEEPREAD_MAX_BYTES` | `0` (= built-in 32 MiB) | deep-read crawl aggregate byte cap |
| `--deepread-wall` | `MARGINCE_DEEPREAD_WALL` | `0` (= built-in 4m) | deep-read crawl wall clock |
| `--observe-addr` | `MARGINCE_OBSERVE_ADDR` | — (off) | address to serve this worker's `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on, e.g. `127.0.0.1:9101`. Empty serves nothing — see below |

### The worker's own operator surface

`--observe-addr` gives `cmd/worker` the three operational endpoints the api has
always had. It answers a question the fleet-wide gauges structurally cannot:
**which process** is not doing the work. Every job-table gauge is a projection
of a shared table, so it reads the same whichever replica served the scrape —
one wedged worker in a pool of three is arithmetically invisible in it.

What this listener carries is therefore only what is **process-local**, and it
re-serves no fleet-wide reading:

| Family | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `margince_process_goroutines` | goroutines in the scraped process |
| `margince_process_heap_bytes` / `margince_process_heap_sys_bytes` | heap in use, and heap held from the OS |
| `margince_process_gc_cycles_total` | completed GC cycles since this process started |
| `margince_pgxpool_conns` | this process's own connection pool, by class |
| `margince_relay_published_total` | outbox rows *this* relay has shipped since start |

The same `margince_process_*` section is served by `cmd/api` too — it describes
whichever process answered, which is exactly what makes it worth having on both.
`margince_outbox_unpublished`, the job-table gauges and the declared catalogue
stay a **single** reading on the api: two roles answering one fleet number is a
worse operator surface than one gap.

`/readyz` probes the three things this replica needs before it can do any work
— **`boot`**, **`postgres`** and **`redis`** — and answers `503` naming the one
that failed. `boot` is this replica having finished starting its event lanes and
job runner: the listener comes up before those on purpose, so a probe answers
during a slow boot, and without that check the ordering would let a rollout
retire the last working replica in favour of one that had not yet picked up a
job, and it goes false again the moment shutdown begins — the listener is
stopped LAST so the drain stays observable, and a draining replica that still
answered ready would keep being sent work it is putting down. The body carries
no AI line — unlike the api this role wires none, and an
empty field reads as a state that could not be determined rather than as one
that does not apply. `/healthz` stays a dumb liveness answer, so a database
outage stops traffic being routed here without restart-looping a process the
outage did not break.

**Off is the default, and it is not a convenience default.** Unlike the api's
`/metrics` this surface carries no workspace id and no tenant data at all — but
it is still an unauthenticated operator surface that discloses dependency health
and process capacity, so exposing it is an operator decision, and so is the
interface it binds. Bind it to a loopback or a private interface, never a public
one. An address that cannot be bound is a **boot error** naming it — a worker
that could not serve its probes must not carry on looking healthy.

### `worker siteread` — the deep-read debug loop (no DB)

`worker siteread <url…> [--urls-file f]` runs the whole crawl→extract→merge
pipeline in memory — no Postgres, no Redis, no staging — and prints every
intermediate: pages with skip reasons, every extracted field/fact with its
evidence, every finding the gate DROPPED (with why), merge decisions, and
per-model-call token/latency telemetry. Exactly one model selection is
required: `--model provider:model` (e.g. `anthropic:claude-opus-4-8` — needs
the provider's BYOK env key) or `--ai-fake` (crawl dry-run). This lane opens no
database, so it never reads the installation's stored binding. `--max-pages/--max-bytes/--wall` override the
caps per run; `--json <path|->` writes a diffable machine-readable report;
`--dump-pages <dir>` saves each page's reduced text.

Extraction runs two routed lanes CONCURRENTLY with the crawl (page
calls launch as pages commit): `site_fact_extract` — one compact call
per fact-bearing page, cheap-tier-first (the reply cites numbered
passages instead of quoting, which a fast model emits reliably) — and
`site_extract` — the ONE premium-first profile call over the
identity-dense excerpts. Evidence is verified in Go against the cited
passage (reference evidence: the stored snippet is the page's own
text). Judge any candidate binding against the pinned quality floor:
`make -C backend e2e-siteread` with `MARGINCE_E2E_MODEL=provider:model`
(paid, network E2E vs gradion.com — a
different model must do the same or better to pass). Typical read:
10–25 s end-to-end depending on how hard the origin throttles the
crawl burst.

Without a declared model (`--ai-routing`/`--ai-fake`) the runner and the
embedding lane simply do not start; the relay, retention, the event-triggered
workflow dispatch (`cg:workflows`), and the clock time-scan always run.
Shutdown is graceful: in-flight subscriber handlers finish their ack before
the process exits.

## The bus address and its logical database (api, worker)

`--redis` accepts a Redis logical database as a suffix: `localhost:16379/7`
selects database 7, and a bare `localhost:16379` keeps the default 0. A suffix
that is not an index in 0–79 is refused rather than ignored — falling back to 0
would put the process on a bus it was configured off. A UNIX SOCKET path
(`/var/run/redis.sock`) is an address rather than a suffixed host and is passed
through whole.

**Why it exists.** The stream names and consumer groups are constants
(`gw:events:crm:*`, `cg:*`), so two installations pointed at one Redis database
share one consumer group per name. Whichever worker reads a stream entry first
consumes it, resolves it against its OWN Postgres database, finds nothing there,
and acknowledges it. The other installation's event is gone, and the symptom —
a projection, an accrual or a notification that simply never runs — looks
exactly like a broken feature rather than a misconfigured bus.

A production installation has its own Redis and needs none of this. It matters
on a developer machine, where one instance serves three blocks — db 0 for bare
`make dev`, 1–63 for the parallel integration lane, 64–79 for `DEV_SLUG` stacks
— so parallel stacks and test packages stop stealing and flushing each other's
events. The startup banner prints which index a slugged stack took.

## Capture connector OAuth (api, worker) — Gmail / Microsoft 365

The Gmail and Outlook/M365 capture connectors are enabled by supplying the
operator's own OAuth app. Absent these, `make dev` is unchanged and the
`/connectors/gmail/*` / `/connectors/graph/*` surfaces stay their declared
501. Secrets travel via the environment, never CLI flags in production
(argv is world-readable). Roles: **api** serves connect/callback, **worker**
runs the background sync.

| Flag | Env | Role | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--gmail-client-id` / `--gmail-client-secret` | `MARGINCE_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` / `MARGINCE_GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | api + worker | the Google OAuth app; with the state key and `--public-base-url`, enables `/connectors/gmail/*` (api) and the sync poll (worker) |
| `--graph-client-id` / `--graph-client-secret` | `MARGINCE_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` / `MARGINCE_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` | api + worker | the Microsoft (Entra) app; same enablement shape for `/connectors/graph/*` (Outlook mail) and `/connectors/graphcal/*` (Outlook calendar). One app serves both, with `Mail.Read` and `Calendars.Read` granted and a redirect URI registered for each — they are separate connections with separate consents |
| `--graph-tenant` | `MARGINCE_GRAPH_TENANT` | api + worker | Microsoft identity tenant (default `common` — any organization) |
| `--microsoft-signin-tenant` | `MARGINCE_MICROSOFT_SIGNIN_TENANT` | api | the Entra **directory id** (a GUID) whose members may sign in, enabling `/auth/oidc/microsoft/*` on the same client id/secret as Graph capture. Defaults to `--graph-tenant` when that already names a directory rather than an authority alias. **Sign-in cannot run on `common`/`organizations`/`consumers`**: it matches the token's address to an existing member, and the administrator of any Entra tenant can set any of their own users' `mail` attribute to any string — so a multi-tenant authority would let anyone who can create a tenant sign in as anyone here. An alias leaves the provider off and says so in the boot log. Add the callback the api prints at boot (`<api-base>/v1/auth/oidc/microsoft/callback`) to the Entra app's redirect URIs, and grant it the `openid profile email` delegated permissions |
| `--connector-state-key` | `MARGINCE_CONNECTOR_STATE_KEY` | api | HMAC key (≥32 bytes) signing the OAuth connect `state`; required for both connect flows |
| `--mcp-apps-base-url` | `MARGINCE_MCP_APPS_BASE_URL` | api | the origin the api reads the MCP App view documents from (`GET <origin>/mcp-apps/<view>.html`), fetched once at startup and refreshed periodically. Defaults to `--public-base-url`, which the connector gate already makes a boot error to omit — so wherever `/mcp` is served the chain cannot be empty. The value must be **API-reachable**, which is not the same as publicly reachable: a container may lack ingress hairpin routing, external DNS or egress, and that is the case this setting exists for. A CDN origin is supported and recommended — it trades a dependency on the web tier for a better one rather than removing it. **The scheme must be `https` unless the host is a literal loopback or private address (or `localhost`)** — a cleartext *hostname* such as `http://web.internal` is refused at BOOT, naming the setting, rather than accepted and then refused by every fetch. With the connector gate off, no fetch happens at all |
| `--api-base-url` | `MARGINCE_API_BASE_URL` | api | the api's externally-reachable base for the OAuth callback `redirect_uri`; defaults to `--public-base-url`, set only when api and SPA are on different origins (e.g. dev). Messaging channels need NO public address of their own — Telegram ingress long-polls, so nothing is ever told where to reach this installation. Google sign-in (`/auth/oidc/google/*`) reuses this same `redirect_uri`, and it must be added to the Gmail-capture client's **authorized redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Console** — enabling sign-in needs no new credentials, but it does need that one Console edit, or every attempt ends in `redirect_uri_mismatch` at Google's consent screen |
| `--gmail-sync-interval` | — | worker | Gmail incremental-sync poll interval (default `2m`) |
| `--gmail-pubsub-topic` | `MARGINCE_GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC` | worker | Gmail Pub/Sub topic (`projects/<p>/topics/<t>`); enables the push-watch register+renew job (empty = poll only) |
| `--gmail-watch-interval` / `--gmail-watch-renew-within` | — | worker | push-watch maintenance scan (`6h`) / renew this far ahead of the 7-day expiry (`48h`) |
| `--gmail-push-token` | `MARGINCE_GMAIL_PUSH_TOKEN` | api | shared secret on the Pub/Sub push subscription URL; enables `POST /webhooks/gmail` (empty = route absent) |
| `--gmail-push-audience` / `--gmail-push-service-account` | `MARGINCE_GMAIL_PUSH_AUDIENCE` / `MARGINCE_GMAIL_PUSH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | api | OIDC audience + signing service-account email; set both and the push webhook also verifies Google's OIDC token |
| `--gmail-jwks-url` | `MARGINCE_GMAIL_JWKS_URL` | api | override Google's OIDC JWKS URL; test/dev only |
| `--graph-notification-url` | `MARGINCE_GRAPH_NOTIFICATION_URL` | worker | public URL Microsoft posts Graph change notifications to, operator token and all (`https://<api>/webhooks/graph?token=…`); enables the subscription register+renew job (empty = poll only) |
| `--graph-watch-interval` / `--graph-watch-renew-within` | — | worker | Graph subscription maintenance scan (`6h`) / renew this far ahead of its deadline (`24h`). Microsoft's ceiling for a `/me/messages` subscription is **4230 minutes** (just under three days) where a Gmail watch lasts seven, so the Gmail defaults do not carry across |
| `--graph-push-token` | `MARGINCE_GRAPH_PUSH_TOKEN` | api | shared secret on the Graph change-notification URL; enables `POST /webhooks/graph` (empty = route absent). It must be the same token the worker's `--graph-notification-url` carries, and it is the ONLY admission factor — Microsoft signs nothing on a change notification |

## Object storage (api, worker) — attachments and company logos

Env-only, shared by both roles; secrets never appear on the command line
(argv is world-readable). Two providers: an S3-compatible service
(`MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_ENDPOINT`) or a local directory
(`MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_PATH`). Leave **both** unset and the `/attachments`
endpoints answer 501; set either to enable them. With both set the endpoint
wins — it is the one that may already hold objects this installation wrote, so
preferring an empty local directory would present a working installation whose
attachments had vanished.

The path provider is for an installation that has local disk and no object
storage service to point at — a single-machine deployment, and the desktop
bundle, whose launcher defaults it to `data/blobs` inside the installation
folder. Everything that rides the store rides both providers: attachments,
company logos and CSV import bodies all go through the same `Store` seam, so
none of them is endpoint-only. It is not a distributed store: no replication, no versioning, no signed
URLs, and it holds bytes only for the machine it runs on. An installation with
more than one api replica needs the endpoint provider, because two machines
cannot share a directory they do not both mount.
Company logos ride the same store. With none configured the resolve lane
returns before fetching, so no logo object is ever written and
`GET /organizations/{id}/logo` answers 404 — every company renders its
deterministic monogram instead. (The 501 on that route is the narrower case: a
record that already names an object on a deployment whose store has since gone
away.)
If attachment rows already exist (uploaded while a store was configured) but
the erasing process has none, Art. 17 erasure **fails and rolls back** rather
than stranding the bytes — it stays retryable until a store is configured. The bucket is created on first connect,
and the store tolerates a still-starting backend with a bounded retry.

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_ENDPOINT` | — | S3/MinIO `host:port`; set to enable attachments and company logos |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_ACCESS_KEY` | — | access key |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_SECRET_KEY` | — | secret key |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_BUCKET` | — | bucket name (created on first connect) |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_REGION` | — | region the bucket lives in; **required when an ENDPOINT is configured**, and deliberately not defaulted — it decides where a bucket holding attachments is created (for MinIO any value works). A path-only installation creates no bucket and never reads it |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_USE_SSL` | `false` | `true` for TLS to the store |
| `MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_PATH` | — | directory object bytes are written to, when no endpoint is set; created if absent, owner-only (`0700`). Bytes land under `<path>/blob/<key>` and their content type under `<path>/meta/<key>`, written through a temporary file and renamed, so a crash never leaves a truncated attachment a row still points at |

## Secret vault (api, worker) — connector credentials

Env-only, shared by both roles; the root key never appears on the command
line (argv is world-readable) or in any log or error. A connector credential
is sealed with AES-256-GCM under this key and stored as ciphertext in the
operational `vault_secret` table; the `connector_connection` row carries only
an opaque, workspace-scoped `credential_ref`, never the credential bytes.
Leave `MARGINCE_KEYVAULT_ROOT_KEY` unset **on an installation that has sealed
nothing** and the vault is absent: every
connector's connect path (gmail, gcal, graph, imap all connect through the
same operation, sealing to the vault) refuses loudly rather than store a
credential in the clear. Set it and the api gains the
`/readyz` keyvault probe and the vault-backed path, and the worker migrates
any legacy `auth`-bytea rows onto the vault at boot (idempotent). A key that
is SET but not exactly 32 bytes (base64-decoded) is a boot error — never a
silent fallback — and so is leaving it unset on an installation that already
holds sealed ciphertext, which is the redeploy-dropped-the-variable case and is
refused rather than degraded (see below).

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MARGINCE_KEYVAULT_ROOT_KEY` | — | base64 (std) of 32 bytes; set to enable the vault. Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32` |

### The vault also holds the two deployment credentials

Connector credentials were the vault's first tenants; two more moved in and
they arrive by a different route. The **outbound-relay password**
(`email.smtp.password`) and the **license token** (`license.token`) are still
DECLARED by the deployment, but on the first boot that sees one the value is
sealed into the vault and the installation records where it went. Nothing is
required of the operator to make that happen, and the boot log says when it
has:

```
sealed a deployment credential into the key vault; the deployment configuration
that declared it can be deleted  credential_name="the license token" declared_at=license.token
```

Once that line appears the declaration may be deleted and the installation keeps
booting on the sealed copy. Nothing here can delete it for you: a process cannot
edit its own deployment.

**Delete the declaration, not just what it points at.** Dropping the variable or
unmounting the file while the `license:` block or the `password:` line is still
in `margince.yaml` fails the boot in `deployconfig`, before the vault is ever
consulted — a `${file:…}` that is gone cannot be read, and a `${env:…}` that is
unset is a named source that yielded nothing, which has always been an error
rather than an absence. Remove the whole `license:` block, or the `password:`
line from `email.smtp`. Then the variable or the file can go too.

**There is no unseal.** Rotating works; *removing* does not. Deleting
`email.smtp.password` used to switch the installation back to an unauthenticated
relay, and it no longer does — the sealed copy keeps answering, because "declared
nothing" and "declared nothing on purpose" are the same input to the resolver.
Nothing in the product deletes either ref today. If you need a relay that takes
no credential, say so on
[issue #2162](https://github.com/margince/margince/issues/2162), which
tracks the supported way to do it. The license is unaffected in practice: an
installation removing its license is one that has stopped paying, and a
production boot refuses an absent license regardless.

**Rotation moves into the vault only for reading, never for writing.** There is
no product surface that changes either credential, and no seeded role holds the
grant to write one, so the sealed copy is only ever a mirror of what the
deployment declares. That is why the DECLARATION still wins when both exist: to
rotate, put the new value back where it used to be — the variable or the file —
and the next boot re-seals it. The superseded ciphertext is deliberately left
in place rather than destroyed: a re-seal is triggered by the declaration alone,
which is exactly what a stale variable or a botched pipeline gets wrong, and
destroying what it supersedes would let one bad boot irreversibly take out the
only copy of a credential nobody meant to replace. What it costs is one
unreferenced blob per rotation — encrypted at rest, reachable by nobody. This is
the
opposite precedence to a BYOK provider key, which the vault wins because the
routing surface can change one.

**A vault that cannot be opened says so**, in two places, because there are two
ways to lose it and they need different sentences.

*The root key is gone.* An installation holding sealed ciphertext with
`MARGINCE_KEYVAULT_ROOT_KEY` unset **refuses to boot**, naming the variable.
This is asked once, where the vault is built, rather than by each reader —
because the loss is not the license's or the relay's, it is every credential the
installation holds at once, connector tokens included. An installation that has
sealed nothing is unaffected and boots with no vault exactly as before. The key
is not recoverable from the ciphertext, or from us: restore the one this
installation sealed with.

*The root key is wrong.* A sealed reference that will not open refuses the boot
naming the vault and the root key, rather than reporting an installation that
has a license as having none — which is what "absent" used to mean on that path,
and a completely different problem for whoever is paged.

One consequence for the **worker**: its license check now runs after its
database pool, because a sealed token lives in a table. It still happens before
the worker does any work, so an operator mistake never leaves a worker running
on a license the api refuses to boot on.

## Custom-field schema pool (api) — runtime DDL

`--schema-dsn`/`MARGINCE_SCHEMA_DSN` is the api-only owner-role DSN behind
`createCustomField` and `updateCustomFieldOptions`: the
customfields engine's single chokepoint for a runtime `ALTER TABLE`. Leave
it unset and both operations answer `501` (`ErrSchemaChangesUnavailable`)
rather than nil-derefing a pool that was never mounted — `renameCustomField`,
`retireCustomField`, and `listCustomFields` need no schema pool and always
work. When set, the api opens a **second** pgxpool sized to `pool_max_conns=3`
(unless the DSN already sets `pool_max_conns` itself, matching
`database.NewPool`'s DSN-wins-over-default rule): every schema change is
serialized behind a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed on the target
table, so this pool never runs more than one `ALTER` against the same
table at a time — concurrent `ALTER`s against different tables are not
serialized against each other, just against races on their own table — a
small, deliberate footprint next to the app pool's `MaxConns=16` default. The
transaction runs the DDL as the owner role, then downgrades itself
(`SET LOCAL ROLE margince_app`) before the catalog/audit write, so the
credential this DSN names must be the same owner role `cmd/migrate` uses.
Configured, it also gains the api's `/readyz` `customfields-schema-pool`
probe.

## cmd/migrate — schema migrations

```
migrate <up|down> --dsn <owner-dsn> [--steps n]
migrate reset-password --dsn <owner-dsn> --email <user-email>
migrate <recreate-db|drop-db|db-exists> --dsn <owner-maintenance-dsn> --name <db> [--template <db>]
migrate org-exists --dsn <owner-dsn>
```

`org-exists` prints `true` or `false`: whether this installation already holds an
active organization. It takes no `--name` — it asks about the database the DSN
names. A deployment asks before the api starts, to know whether a bootstrap
credential is still needed; `scripts/deploy/api-entrypoint.sh` writes the
`bootstrap_admin` password file only while the answer is `false`, because
ADR-0061 §2 consumes bootstrap values exactly once and permits deleting that
secret once the organization exists. The answer is **printed rather than
signalled by exit status**, so a caller can tell "no" from "could not ask"; a
failed probe exits non-zero and must not be read as "unprovisioned".

**Once an installation is bootstrapped, remove the `bootstrap_admin` section from
`margince.yaml` and unset `MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.** Leaving the section in
place keeps the api reading a password file that is no longer written. Use
`migrate reset-password` to change an existing user's password.

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dsn` | `MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN`, else `MARGINCE_DSN` | — (required) | Postgres DSN, **owner** role. The owner variable takes precedence, and that ordering is load-bearing: every verb here runs DDL, while `MARGINCE_DSN` is the **app** role everywhere else in the product (`NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`, no DDL rights). An installation that sets both and relies on the default would otherwise migrate under the one credential that cannot apply migrations. `MARGINCE_DSN` remains the fallback so a small installation running everything under one sufficiently-privileged credential still works. For the db verbs the DSN must name a maintenance database (`postgres`): `CREATE`/`DROP DATABASE` cannot run inside the database being dropped |
| `--steps` | — | `1` | migrations to revert (`down` only) |
| `--email` | — | — | user email (`reset-password` only): the operator break-glass — sets that user's password directly against the database, reading the new password from **stdin** (never argv); the way back in when the admin is locked out and no outbound email is configured. It covers **lockout and operator-led recovery**, not routine member provisioning: an admin without a database credential onboards members from Settings → Users & roles, where an installation with no outbound email offers a per-member "Get set-password link" to deliver out of band (ADR-0061 Amendment 1) |
| `--name` | — | — | database name (`recreate-db`, `drop-db`, `db-exists` only): the integration lane's clone-per-package admin — drop-if-exists + create, drop-if-exists, or print `true`/`false`; the drops are `WITH (FORCE)`, so a lingering session dies rather than flaking the teardown. Runs on the same owner DSN the migrations and tests use, so the lane needs no host psql and an overridden `MARGINCE_TEST_DSN` targets one cluster throughout. A name (or template) over the server's identifier limit (63 bytes stock) is rejected, never silently truncated onto a different database |
| `--template` | — | — | template database to copy (`recreate-db` only): `CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE`, a fast file copy |

## Other environment variables

| Var | Used by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MARGINCE_ENV` | api (`runtimeenv.Parse`) | Read at boot and parsed **fail-closed**: only the exact values `dev` or `test` yield a non-production posture; unset, `production`, `staging`, or any unrecognized value ⇒ production. It decides two **licensing** questions and nothing else: which issuers the installation honours, and whether it may run unlicensed at all (a production role refuses to boot with no license). No destructive capability keys off it. `staging` was retired deliberately: a staging installation carries real internal users, so it takes the production posture. The Makefile exports `dev`; production must not set it. |
| `MARGINCE_TEST_DSN`, `MARGINCE_TEST_APP_DSN`, `MARGINCE_TEST_REDIS` | integration tests | owner DSN / app-role DSN / Redis address for the real-Postgres lane; exported by the Makefile. The lane runs on its own `_test` namespace (the `margince_test` DB, never the dev `margince` DB), so it can run alongside `make dev`. |
| `MARGINCE_TEST_REDIS_DB` | integration tests | Redis logical db for the lane (default 15). db 0 is reserved for a running `make dev`; a valid value is 1..15, and the parallel runner assigns one per package so concurrent packages never share a stream. Out-of-range fails loudly. |
| `MARGINCE_TEST_CLONE_DB` | integration tests | names the throwaway clone this package's process was handed, set by `scripts/test-integration-parallel.sh` and `scripts/test-integration-one.sh` beside the two DSNs. It is what lets `testdb.EnsureSchema` reuse a database the lane copied from an already-migrated template instead of dropping the schema and re-applying every migration onto it (~1.3 s per package process). The value is a database NAME and not a flag: the skip additionally requires it to equal `current_database()`, which refuses the serial lane (it runs on the template itself, where the rebuild is what keeps one package's residue out of every later clone) and any suite that made its own database mid-process. Unset means rebuild, so a lane that forgets it is slower and never wrong. |
| `MARGINCE_TEST_POOL_MAX_CONNS` | integration tests | ceiling for EACH pool the harness opens from the clone DSNs, set by `scripts/test-integration-parallel.sh` to the per-pool number its connection budget was sized for. Unset (the one-package lane, a suite run by hand) the pool keeps `database.NewPool`'s own 16, because one package oversubscribes nothing. It is an env var rather than a DSN parameter because `pgx.ParseConfig` — which `cmd/migrate` and every bare `pgx` connection a fixture opens use — forwards an unrecognised `pool_*` key to the server as a startup parameter and dies with `FATAL: unrecognized configuration parameter`. A non-numeric or non-positive value fails loudly: a ceiling that silently fails to apply leaves the lane's budget describing a limit nothing enforces. |
| `MARGINCE_TEST_BLOBSTORE_ENDPOINT`, `MARGINCE_TEST_BLOBSTORE_ACCESS_KEY`, `MARGINCE_TEST_BLOBSTORE_SECRET_KEY`, `MARGINCE_TEST_BLOBSTORE_BUCKET` | integration tests | the object store the blobstore lane runs against; exported by the Makefile at the `make db-up` MinIO, on its own `margince-test` bucket. The endpoint being unset **fails** the lane rather than skipping it — a skipped storage gate reads exactly like a passing one. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT` | `make e2e-ai` | the AI-certification lane's runtime switch. The `e2e_llm` build tag keeps this paid, live lane out of every ordinary lane; once the tag is set, an empty value here **fails** rather than skips, so the lane can never report success for having done nothing. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_MODEL`, `MARGINCE_AICERT_JUDGE_MODEL` | `make e2e-ai` | **both required** — `provider:model` each. The candidate is what the run certifies; the judge grades it and must be a DIFFERENT model, because one grading itself is certified by construction. The run refuses the two being equal before a single paid call. Surfaced as `MODEL=` and `JUDGE=`. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_ROUTING` | `make e2e-ai` | path to a deployment config whose `seeds.ai_routing` names the binding to certify. Certifies a DEPLOYMENT rather than a model: each task is measured against whatever is bound at its **leading ladder rung** (the rung that would actually serve it), so one run writes records across several models — which is what the config binds. Mutually exclusive with `MARGINCE_AICERT_MODEL`, and the run refuses both: one names a deployment, the other one candidate to A/B a prompt fix against. Under it `MARGINCE_AICERT_PROFILE` is ignored and the profile is the file's own, because a record's environment class must come from the config that named the models. The judge is still named separately and is never resolved from the routing — `cert_judge` is itself a task and leads at `premium`, so a config binding a model there would make the grader collide with every `premium`-led candidate. Surfaced as `ROUTING=`. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_BASE_URL`, `MARGINCE_AICERT_JUDGE_BASE_URL` | `make e2e-ai` | endpoint host root for a broker or OpenAI-wire host. Required for `openai_compatible`, which fails closed without one; empty for a native vendor, which uses its own default. Surfaced as `BASE_URL=`. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_PROFILE` | `make e2e-ai` | the environment class a record is filed under (`eu_hosted` \| `sovereign` \| `cloud_frontier`), default `eu_hosted`; ignored when `MARGINCE_AICERT_ROUTING` is set, which takes the profile from the config file instead. Not a label: it is part of a record's identity, and it is enforced — a cloud vendor under `sovereign` is refused rather than run. Surfaced as `PROFILE=`. |
| `MARGINCE_VOICE_MODEL`, `MARGINCE_VOICE_BASE_URL` | `TestVoiceLiveSmoke` | the model the manual voice-live smoke drives, `provider:model`, plus an endpoint host root when it is on a broker. Manual-only: the smoke fails rather than skips without one, so a run that measured nothing is never mistaken for a pass. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_TASK`, `MARGINCE_AICERT_RUNS`, `MARGINCE_AICERT_TRACE` | `make e2e-ai` | narrow certification to one task / repeat count / directory for the request+response dump. All optional: unset certifies everything the corpus covers. Surfaced as `TASK=`, `RUNS=`, `TRACE=`. |
| `MARGINCE_AICERT_RESUME` | `make e2e-ai` | directory for the resume journal: every scored run is appended to it as it is scored, so a run cut short by a dropped connection is restarted without paying for the runs it already made. A journaled run is replayed only on the same candidate binding, judge, profile, corpus version, scenario stamp, BINARY and repeat index, and only within six hours — anything else is measured again. The binary is in that list because a stamp covers the requests, never the code that judges the replies. One run owns a resume directory at a time, held by a lock file. Empty turns it off, which forces a run to measure everything fresh. Surfaced as `RESUME=`, on by default. |
| `MARGINCE_ANTHROPIC_KEY` | `ai` package smoke test | BYOK Anthropic key for the live Anthropic smoke test. Distinct from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which is what the **runtime** reads for a bound `anthropic` provider. |
| `MARGINCE_BENCH_TIER` | `make bench-perf` | the PERF-3/PERF-7 seed tier the perfbench suite builds — `smb` (default) or `mid_market`. An unrecognized value fails the bench loudly. |
| `MARGINCE_BENCH_RECORD` | `make bench-perf` | set to `1` to let the PERF-3/PERF-7 tier harness WRITE its record into `docs/reference/perfbench/`, which `make perfdoc` renders into the published budgets page. Off by default because a scheduled job runs the same suite weekly (`make bench-perf-check`), and a machine must never write its own numbers into the tree. The by-hand `bench-record`/`bench-capture`/`bench-mobile` targets need no switch — nothing but a human runs them. |
| `MARGINCE_AITASK_DIR` | `worker aitask` | working directory for the `ai-probe` debug loop's artifacts (flag `--work-dir`, default the gitignored `.tmp/aitask/`). A fetched page carries whatever the source carried, so this stays out of the tree. |
| `MARGINCE_HOME` | desktop launcher | overrides the installation folder the launcher works from. Unset, it resolves the directory of the running executable, which is where the launcher sits inside a packaged folder — so this is what lets a development stack be driven from a staging tree that was never packaged. Everything else the launcher touches is derived from it: `data/` with the database and the blobs, `margince.yaml`, `margince.env`, and the replaceable `runtime/`. |
| `MARGINCE_SEED_PASSWORD` | `tools/seed-demo` | the password the demo seeder signs in with, so a credential never lands in a shell history or a make target. Equivalent to its `-password` flag. |
| `MARGINCE_SEED_DSN` | `tools/seed-demo` | owner DSN for the two things the demo seeder cannot do over the API: create a team (read-only on the contract) and set a seat's password (no endpoint accepts one under 12 characters). Equivalent to its `-dsn` flag; unset skips both phases rather than failing, because the rest of the seed is useful without them. |

### `POST /v1/admin/reset-data` — the armed data reset

Gated on `operations.allow_data_reset` in `margince.yaml`, whose compiled
default is **false in every posture, dev included**. An installation that did
not arm it has no such operation: the switch is checked **before** auth, so a
deployment that never asked for it 404s rather than leaking that the endpoint
exists (never a 403).

It is deliberately not a `setting` row and not inferred from `MARGINCE_ENV`.
An admin who could arm it through the API could arm the purge of their own
tenant's data; and a deployment labelled `staging` — real internal users, real
records — is not thereby consenting to be wiped. The same value is what `/me`
reports as `data_reset_available`, so a client never renders an action the
server would refuse.

```yaml
operations:
  allow_data_reset: true   # dev/test only; omit or false everywhere else
```

Once armed:

1. **Human-only** (`auth.RequireHuman`) — an agent/passport principal is
   rejected, 403.
2. **Admin-only** (`auth.RequireAdmin`) — the literal `admin` role; `ops` and
   every other role is rejected, 403.
3. **Typed confirmation** — the request body `{"confirmation": "<organization
   name>"}` must equal the workspace's organization name exactly; a mismatch
   is `422` (never partially applied — checked before anything is touched).

On success it wipes workspace domain + seeded-config data back to the
first-boot bootstrapped state and re-runs the module seeders (pipeline/stages,
consent purposes + retention, AI defaults, starter automations, the booking
page) — the same seed path `identity`'s installation bootstrap uses. It
**preserves** the identity/auth layer (every `app_user`, roles, role
assignments, teams, team memberships, sessions, passports, tokens — so login
keeps working) and the append-only ledgers `audit_log` / `system_log`.
The reset itself is recorded as an `audit_log` row (action `reset_data`).

The `workspace` row survives too — it carries the organization — but only its
**installation identity** is preserved: the primary key, the name, slug, base
currency and timezone bootstrap took from `margince.yaml`, and `created_at`.
(`updated_at` moves, as it does for any write — the reset did write the row.)
Every other column on it is a workspace-level **setting**, and each
one goes back to the default its migration declared (the overlay mode columns
today, and whatever is added next). Nothing here is a kept list:
the columns are derived from the catalog, so a setting added later is restored
the day its column exists, and a column that genuinely belongs to the
installation's identity has to be declared preserved to be spared. Settings
that live in the `setting` table rather than on this row are restored on the
same path, by the same split — configuration returns to its registered
default, the installation's identity does not.

The sweep runs as the app role — no superuser, no disabled triggers — so it
discovers a safe delete order at runtime (a savepoint per table per pass,
retrying whatever a still-live FK blocks) rather than relying on a hand-kept
ordering; an unbreakable FK cycle is surfaced as an error, never silently
skipped. Orphaned `cf_*` custom-field columns are dropped afterward through
the owner schema pool (`--schema-dsn`); with no schema pool configured that
step is skipped (logged, not swallowed) and the reset itself still succeeds.

#### It resets the runtime, not only the rows

Table rows are not the whole installation. Queued jobs, bus entries, Redis
counters, every process's in-memory caches and the stored object bytes all
outlive a row sweep, so a reset that stopped there would leave work executing
against records that no longer exist. The endpoint therefore also:

1. **Pauses every job queue and drains it**, bounded to 10 seconds. The pause
   is mediated by `river_queue`, so the api quiets the queues the *worker*
   process owns. A drain that does not finish never fails the reset — a long
   pass must not make an installation unresettable — but it sets
   `drain_timed_out` in the response, the audit evidence and the log, and the
   surviving job's completion write will fail against the wiped rows.
2. **Drains the staged outbox** — this workspace's `event_outbox` rows, in a
   transaction of its own *before* the streams are purged. The outbox relay is
   not part of the job fleet the pause stopped, so rows left staged would be
   shipped into the streams moments after they were emptied. This narrows that
   window to one in-flight relay batch rather than closing it.
3. **Purges job rows** (`river_job`): this workspace's rows plus the fleet
   dispatchers, which the periodic ticks re-insert on the next cadence — in
   every state, including River's retained completed/discarded/cancelled
   history, which an installation wiped back to first-boot state must not carry.
4. **Purges the event bus** — the catalog streams, their consumer groups
   (deleted and immediately re-created, so live subscribers keep reading), the
   processed-event dedupe marks, and this workspace's overlay budget counters.
5. **Deletes the workspace's stored objects** under its `<workspace>/` prefix.
   It also redeems the **sealed credentials** those swept connection rows
   referenced. `vault_secret` deliberately carries no `workspace_id` — the
   tenant lives inside the ref and inside the AES-256-GCM AAD — so the sweep
   cannot see it, and the handles are collected inside the sweep's transaction
   before the rows naming them go. Which tables hold one is derived from the
   catalog on the `credential_ref` column, so a connection table added later is
   covered the day its column exists.
6. **Restores every workspace-level setting**, including returning an
   overlay-mode installation to native. The table sweep reaches none of them:
   its target list is derived from the tables carrying a `workspace_id` column,
   and `workspace` keys on `id`, so that row is not a candidate for it at all.
   The overlay columns are the consequential case — everything overlay mode
   depends on IS swept (the incumbent connection, the mirror, the budget
   counters), so a workspace left in overlay would claim to read from an
   incumbent it no longer has a connection to, dispatching every read at an
   empty mirror. `x_sor_mode` and `x_incumbent` flip together, as the schema
   requires. This is not the governed `Disconnect` teardown: those rows are
   already gone with the sweep, the reset carries its own audit row, and no
   `incumbent.disconnected` event is emitted into an outbox this reset just
   drained. Whether it happened is recorded as `sor_mode_reverted` in the audit
   evidence and the completion log line.
7. **Announces the reset** on the `gw:control:reset` Redis pub/sub channel, so
   the api and the worker each drop the caches they hold — model results and
   the resolved system-of-record mode. No HTTP call reaches the worker process;
   this channel is the only path to it.

   The announcement clears **caches and nothing else**. The channel carries no
   signature, so anyone who can reach that Redis can publish on it, and a cache
   drop costs a recomputation. The auth lockout buckets are deliberately not
   reachable this way: they brake brute-force login and password-reset email
   spam, so the process that ran the audited, gated reset clears its own and no
   announcement clears anyone else's.

The queues are resumed on every exit path, including a failure and a panic,
on a context detached from the request — an operator whose client disconnects
mid-reset must not leave the fleet paused. Killing the process outright
(SIGKILL) runs no exit path at all and does strand the pause; re-running the
reset lifts it.

The Redis half is **installation-wide**, from a declared key inventory — the
stream catalog, the `gw:dedupe:` namespace and `ovb:<workspace>:` — and never
`FLUSHDB`, so anything else sharing that Redis survives. Installation-wide is
exact here because one installation serves one organization (A107/ADR-0061).
One consequence worth knowing locally: parallel `DEV_SLUG` stacks share a
single Redis database, so a reset in one stack clears the other's bus.

The 200 body reports what was actually cleared — `tables_cleared`,
`jobs_deleted` (job rows in every state, history included — not a backlog
depth), `streams_purged` (stream *keys*, not entries), `cache_keys_deleted`
(dedupe marks plus budget counters), `objects_deleted` and `drain_timed_out`.
The same counts go into the `audit_log` evidence, with one deliberate
exception: `objects_deleted` is not in the audit row, because the object purge
cannot join the transaction that writes it.

Any purge step failing fails the whole request with an opaque 500 (the cause
is logged server-side). What a failure leaves behind depends on which side of
the commit it happened. The queue, bus and budget purges run *before* the
database transaction, so failing there leaves a safe partial state — those
surfaces clear, the data intact — that re-running the reset recovers. The
object purge is the exception: it cannot join that transaction and so runs
*after* it commits, which means a 500 from the object store reports failure
with the rows already wiped and some stored bytes still present. Re-running
the reset is again the recovery.

`GET /v1/me`'s `data_reset_available` field carries the same switch the endpoint
gates on, so the SPA shows the action only where it will work: Admin settings → *data* tab → Danger
zone → *Reset data*, which prompts the operator to type the organization name
before calling the endpoint — the server is the sole validator of that string,
the client-side prompt is only UX.

The **deployment configuration** (`--config`, default `margince.yaml`) is
seeded the same way for local dev. The annotated reference is
[`config/margince.example.yaml`](../../config/margince.example.yaml); `make dev`
copies it to a gitignored `config/margince.yaml` on first run and then
**leaves it** (create-if-missing / leave-if-exists), so an engineer's edits — organization,
`bootstrap_admin`, or the `ai.capture_payloads` posture — persist across
`make dev-stop` / `make dev` rather than being regenerated each boot. The
admin `password_file` it references (`config/margince-admin-password`) is
seeded alongside on first run; both are gitignored. `--config` reaches
**both** the api and worker, so a posture like `ai.capture_payloads` applies
to every role. Delete `config/margince.yaml` and re-run `make dev` to reset.

#### The file layer is two files: a base and the posture's overlay

`MARGINCE_ENV` selects an overlay read on top of the base, named by inserting
the posture before the extension — so `--config config/margince.yaml` under
`MARGINCE_ENV=dev` also reads
[`config/margince.dev.yaml`](../../config/margince.dev.yaml). Neither file has
to exist. The derivation is the same for every posture, production included, so
a deployment that wants the split gets it by the same rule rather than by an
exception.

The full order, which is OPS-CFG-1 with the file layer split in two:

```
compiled defaults → margince.yaml → margince.<posture>.yaml → env vars → flags
```

Later wins. Within the file layer, how a key merges is legible from the YAML
itself:

| The base key is | The overlay | Why |
|---|---|---|
| a scalar (`connector_enabled: false`) | replaces it | one value, one answer |
| a mapping (`model_pricing:`) | merges key by key | an overlay adds a provider without restating the others |
| a list (`fx_currencies: [USD, GBP]`) | replaces it entirely | half a list is not a list — `[SEK]` means SEK |

The consequence worth knowing: an overlay can add a mapping key and change one,
but cannot **remove** one. A posture that must not have a key takes it out of
the base and puts it in the postures that want it.

Both files decode strictly. An unknown key in either is a boot error naming the
file that holds it, and validation runs once over the merged result — so an
overlay may complete a section the base only starts.

`MARGINCE_ENV` is a **configuration selector, not a trust boundary**. Nothing
destructive keys off it: the data reset is armed by `operations.allow_data_reset`
below, which is why the dev arming lives in the tracked
`config/margince.dev.yaml` and every other posture gets the compiled default.

`capture.trace_payloads` (default `true`) keeps each traced message's sender and
a bounded subject — 320 and 300 characters, never a body — in the 24-hour
Capture activity trace every member sees under Settings. It covers **messages
dropped because every party was internal to your own domains**, which the CRM
otherwise stores nothing about and which are exactly what an operator is looking
for when a message went missing.

It is on by default because the trace exists to answer why a message did not
arrive, and a page of decisions naming nobody cannot: it tells a member their
mail is a black box rather than telling them what the pipeline threw away. A
member reads only rows from their own connections — no grant widens them — so
this is somebody's own mail shown back to them.

Set it to `false` where a works agreement requires it; the trace then keeps
recording every decision and names nobody. It is settable only here: there is no
API and no in-app switch, so neither posture is a member's to change for their
colleagues. The hourly sweep deletes payloads with the rows carrying them, an
erased subject's address is never written whatever the posture says, and an
Art. 17 request inside the window reaches what is already there.

`company_context.rollout` is the ordered server-side company-context capability:
`off` disables context reads, injection, and the new onboarding surface; `read`
enables the canonical read model and Company Context settings; `tasks` also
injects bounded context into declared AI tasks; `onboarding` additionally enables
the five-step first-run flow. The default is `onboarding`. Moving backward is a
reversible operational kill switch and never deletes confirmed company data.

### Uploads

The `uploads:` block sets how large a request each route that carries a **file**
may read (OPS-CFG-12). Every other route stays on the 1 MiB JSON bound, which is
a security invariant and is deliberately not configurable: several handlers
decode the body with no bound of their own, and two of those routes are
unauthenticated.

| Key | Default | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `uploads.attachment_mb` | `25` | `POST /v1/attachments` — the documents surface |
| `uploads.csv_import_mb` | `10` | `POST /v1/imports/sources` |
| `uploads.linkedin_import_mb` | `8` | `POST /v1/me/linkedin-connections` |

**Decimal megabytes**: `25` means 25,000,000 bytes, not 26,214,400. The value
here is the number the server's 413 names and the number the upload form states,
and those three agreeing is why the unit is decimal rather than binary — a
binary constant reads as "25 MB" in a sentence while admitting 4.8% more.

The ceiling bounds the **whole request**, part framing included, not the file
alone. The overhead is a few hundred bytes, so it only matters within a rounding
error of the limit; a client that refuses before sending should leave itself
that much room.

An omitted key takes the default. A value outside **1–100 MB** — including an
explicit `0`, which would refuse every upload — is a boot error naming the key,
never a silent clamp. Past 100 MB the answer is an upload straight to object
storage rather than a larger number here, because the request is buffered
through the api's own temp filesystem on its way to the store.

`attachment_mb` is also published, read-only, as `max_upload_bytes` on
`GET /v1/installation/settings`, which every role may read. That is what lets an
upload surface state and enforce **this** installation's limit instead of one
compiled into the client, so an oversize file is refused before it is sent.
A change takes effect on restart, like every other key in this file.

What the block does **not** decide is which routes may carry a file at all. That
list is declared in source (`internal/compose/bodyceiling.go`) and is what keeps
a route carrying no file from obtaining the wider bound by sending a multipart
header; adding to it is a code change with two fitness gates over it.

### License

The `license:` block points at the installation's entitlement token. It is
verified **offline**, in-process, against the license-validation WebAssembly
module bundled at `backend/internal/platform/licensecheck/module/` — no callout
of any kind, so an air-gapped installation proves its entitlement exactly the
way a connected one does. The module, its pin and its digest are installed
together by the publisher's own tooling and are never edited by hand; a blob
that stops matching its recorded digest fails `make check`.

| field | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | *(none)* | The token as a reference — `${file:/run/secrets/margince-license}` or `${env:SOME_VAR}`. The preferred spelling, and the one a refusal recommends. An inline value is refused at decode time. |
| `token_file` | *(none)* | The original spelling, still honoured so an existing deployment boots unchanged. Path to a file holding the license token. A **file reference, never an inline value**: it is a credential, and this file gets read, copied and pasted into support threads. Overridden by `MARGINCE_LICENSE` when that variable is set to a non-empty value — the same variable name the validation module itself reads, so a container that already exports the license needs no `license:` block at all. |

Three postures, and what each one does at boot:

| posture | boot | reported as |
|---|---|---|
| **no token configured** | **refuses to boot in production**; boots with a warning when `MARGINCE_ENV` is `dev` or `test` | `margince_license_posture{state="absent"} 1` |
| **token verified** | boots | `margince_license_posture{state="valid"} 1`, plus `margince_license_seats` when the license grants a seat count |
| **token refused** | **refuses to boot** (api and worker alike), naming the module's own reason and the setting to correct | — |

On the first boot that resolves a token it is sealed into the key vault, after
which the declaration above may be removed — see
[the vault also holds the two deployment credentials](#the-vault-also-holds-the-two-deployment-credentials)
for what that changes about rotation, and for the boot refusal an unreachable
vault produces instead of an "absent" posture.

**A production installation serves on a license or it does not serve.** The
posture decides it, and `MARGINCE_ENV` is fail-closed, so an installation that
names nothing is production and is held to a license. The refusal names both
ways out — configure the token, or name the installation non-production — because
the operator reading it is either licensed and missing the reference, or running
a development installation that never said so. A refused license refuses the
boot in *every* posture: naming yourself non-production is how you say you have
no license, not a way to run one the module has judged.

A refusal covers an untrusted signature, the wrong issuer, expiry past the grace
period the module carries, and no grant for this product at this generation. A
module that cannot **run** at all is refused the same way: a validation module
the build cannot execute is a packaging fault, and reading it as an unlicensed
installation would turn that into a silent downgrade. A configured `token_file`
that cannot be read, or that is empty, is likewise a boot error rather than an
unlicensed installation — those two are the same posture to everything
downstream, so a mistyped path must not read as a deliberate choice.

A license that lapses **while the process runs** does not stop it. The api
re-checks daily and its `/metrics` posture degrades; nothing goes offline
mid-month without a human in the loop. The re-check re-reads `token_file` (or the
variable) each time, so a license renewed in place takes effect within a day
without a restart. Anything that is not a verdict — an unreadable token, a module
that failed to run — leaves the posture the process last resolved and is logged
as itself: none of those is evidence about the license, and degrading on one would
report a refusal that no license caused.

**The granted seat count is enforced where a seat comes into use.** Once every
licensed full seat is taken, inviting a member and reactivating a deactivated
full seat are refused with `403 seat_limit_reached`, carrying the granted and
used counts. Nothing already in use is touched: no seat is demoted, no session
ends, and a license that lapses mid-month refuses the NEXT seat rather than
taking away the ones people are working in (P7). Read seats are unlimited and
never counted; a suspended or deactivated seat frees its own, so an admin at the
ceiling can make room. A license carrying no seat count caps nothing, and so
does an unlicensed development installation — the ceiling is read live, so a
license renewed in place raises it on the next re-check without a restart. The
number an admin is refused against is the number the entitlement screen and
`margince_license_seats` report: one count, one statement.

**Which authority a license must come from.** A production installation honors
exactly one: `margince-license-authority`. That is not redundant with the bundled
keyset — our non-production licensers sign with keys that keyset carries, so the
issuer is the only thing that keeps a license minted for a test from licensing a
customer. An installation running with `MARGINCE_ENV` set to `dev` or
`test` also honors `margince-license-authority-test` and
`margince-license-authority-dev`, which is how a developer runs the product on a
test license. `MARGINCE_ENV` is fail-closed: unset or unrecognized is production,
so an installation gets the narrow set unless somebody named otherwise on purpose.
The boot line names the authority whenever it is not the production one.

A token is read up to 64 KiB. A larger file is a boot error rather than a token,
because a path pointing at something that is not a license (a log, an image) is a
mistake to report, and everything downstream copies the token whole.

Every development and CI process in this repository runs unlicensed, which is
why an absent license is a supported posture rather than a refusal.

### Rates

The `rates:` block configures the admin **"Refresh from sources"** jobs (worker
role). A refresh never writes a rate directly — it stages **confirm-first
proposals** into the approvals inbox, and a human approves each before it
applies. It is read only by the worker (the api enqueues the job; the worker
crawls and stages).

| field | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `fx_source` | `https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest` | Base-relative FX JSON API (`{base,rates}`, queried `?base=&symbols=`). The default is the free, no-key ECB feed. |
| `fx_currencies` | `[USD, GBP, CHF]` | Candidate foreign currencies the FX refresh proposes to **bootstrap an empty rate sheet** — a fresh install tracks none, so without a candidate set the refresh would have nothing to fetch. Once the sheet has rows, the refresh re-prices exactly those tracked currencies and this set is unused. Each entry must be **ISO 4217-shaped** (three uppercase letters) and unique, or boot fails — the same shape check as `base_currency`; existence is not verified, so a well-formed but unsupported code (`USX`) parses and is then skipped by the source with a logged warning rather than a staged proposal. |
| `model_pricing` | *(none)* | Maps a provider name to its pricing-page URL the model-cost refresh crawls and AI-extracts (the `rate_extract` task — `make e2e-ai-report` says what any binding has been certified to). A plain `GET` must yield the price text — Google's docs page does; many JS-rendered marketing pages yield none. |

The **model-cost refresh** needs both a `model_pricing` entry **and** a bound
`rate_extract` model (in the installation's stored binding); absent either, it
no-ops. The **FX
refresh**, by contrast, has no such dependency — `fx_source` and `fx_currencies`
both default, so it always has something to do even on an absent `rates:` block.
Neither refresh ever auto-applies — a rate is proposed from the live source and
applied only on human approval, so a non-EUR deal with no approved rate still
fails closed (never a silent `rate=1`).

Model credentials (BYOK cloud tiers) live in the **key vault**, put there by an
admin under Settings → AI → Model provider keys. Neither is a binary flag, and
neither is the routing file — a binding names providers and never a credential.

A provider's conventional environment variable is a **seed** for a vault-backed
role: a boot that resolves a binding may seal what it finds and record where,
after which the variable can be unset — check the boot log said so before
removing it. It remains the runtime source, read on every run, in two cases: an
installation with **no vault** configured, and the DB-less debug and
certification lanes, which open no vault. Removing the variable breaks those.

The **binding** is a stored setting, and there is no routing file left anywhere.
A fresh installation declares it under `seeds.ai_routing` (see
`config/margince.example.yaml`); a running one is rebound from Settings → AI. A
dev stack is bound by `seeds.ai_routing` in `config/margince.dev.yaml`.

The lanes that probe a binding without opening a database are told their model
outright rather than handed a file: `worker siteread` and `worker aitask` take
`--model provider:model` or `--ai-fake`, and `make e2e-ai` takes `MODEL=` and
`JUDGE=` (see the certification variables below). The shape a binding has —
`profile` plus a `tiers` map — is described under `$defs.aiRouting` in
[`config/margince.schema.json`](../../config/margince.schema.json), which is
what an editor validates a `seeds.ai_routing` block against.

The providers a binding may name, and what each requires. A cloud provider's
BYOK key is **read from an environment variable** at boot — the routing file
names only the provider (a stray `api_key:` there is a startup error):

A cloud provider's key lives in the **key vault**, and an admin puts one there
at Settings → AI → Model provider keys (`PUT /v1/ai/provider-keys/{provider}`).
The environment variable in the table below is a SEED, not the home: a key found
there is sealed on the next boot and the variable can then be deleted. Both
routes still fail closed — a bound provider with a key by neither is refused at
construction, naming what is missing.

| provider | key env var (seed) | `base_url` | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fake` | — | — | offline deterministic stub (dev/test) |
| `ollama` | — | optional (default `localhost:11434`) | local; sovereign-eligible |
| `vllm` | — | optional (default `localhost:8000`) | local; sovereign-eligible |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | optional (default `api.anthropic.com`) | BYOK cloud |
| `openai_compatible` | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` | **required** | BYOK cloud, generic OpenAI wire (OpenAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Groq, Together, OpenRouter, …) |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | optional (default `api.openai.com`) | BYOK cloud, native Responses API |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | optional (default `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`) | BYOK cloud, native `generateContent` |

`base_url` for the OpenAI-wire providers (`openai_compatible`, `openai`, and
`vllm`) is the vendor **host root with no version segment** — the adapter
appends `/v1/chat/completions` (or `/v1/responses`), so a base ending in `/v1`
would double it (`…/v1/v1/…` → 404). Use `https://api.mistral.ai`, not
`https://api.mistral.ai/v1`. `gemini` is the mirror: its default base keeps the
`/v1beta` segment and the paths are version-relative.

#### What a binding can be handed (documents, scans, photographed forms)

`document_extract` reads a file by handing it to the bound model when the model
takes that media type, and falls back to the text lane when it does not. What
each provider carries is a property of its **wire**, and is fixed in the adapter:

| provider | carries |
|---|---|
| `anthropic`, `gemini`, `openai` | `image/*` and `application/pdf` — all three wires take a document part natively. On Anthropic that is the Messages API's `document` block, which every active model accepts and which needs no beta header |
| `ollama` | `image/*`, as the chat API's per-message `images` array — that wire has no document part at all. A non-vision model pulled into the binding fails at the runner, visibly |
| `openai_compatible`, `vllm` | whatever the binding declares — see `input:` below |
| `fake` | `image/*` and `application/pdf` (the offline stub mirrors the native wires) |

A media type outside a binding's carriage is **refused, never dropped**: the run
says which file it could not read rather than answering about a document the
model never saw. An `ollama` binding takes inline bytes only, and `anthropic`
takes inline bytes or an `http(s)` URL it fetches itself.

**What carrying a document does and does not guarantee.** Two things are worth
knowing before you enable an attachment lane, because both run the other way
from what a reader tends to assume:

- **Which lane a file takes was decided at ingress, and carriage is not a content
  check.** The AI lane reads the content type the file is stored with and adds no
  second authority of its own. What that type means depends on how the file
  arrived: a **captured** attachment carries the type *sniffed from its bytes*,
  with a disagreeing sender claim recorded rather than obeyed — so an external
  counterparty influences the lane only through the bytes they actually sent — while
  a file **uploaded through the API** carries its uploader's declared type,
  unsniffed. Either way `image/*` matches by prefix, and `input: [image]` says
  what Margince will *carry*; it never says what the bytes *are*.
- **The secret stripper does not reach inside an attachment.** It runs over the
  outbound payload — the right place, and unbypassable — but an attachment rides
  that payload **base64-encoded**, and the rules match a secret's literal text. A
  credential inside an attached file is not there in that form for them to find,
  while the same file arriving as text is scrubbed.

The second is defensible where it stands — the alternative is decoding and
re-encoding every attachment on every call — but it is the scope, not an
oversight. If a deployment needs more than this for a given lane, the answer is
the location ladder (`profile:`) or narrowing that tier with `input:`, not the
stripper.

#### `input:` — what the bound model can be given

A chat tier may declare the input modalities its model accepts:

```yaml
premium:
  provider: openai_compatible
  base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api
  model: mistralai/mistral-large-2512
  input: [text, image]
```

The field does two different jobs, depending on the provider under it.

**On `openai_compatible` and `vllm` it is the whole answer**, because only there
is it unknown to the code: they are one adapter pointed at an operator-chosen
endpoint, so whether an image may be sent depends on **which model was bound**.
Omitted there means text-only.

**On every other provider it narrows.** Their carriage is fixed in the wire, and
a declaration means *at most this* — the binding's carriage is the intersection
of the two. So this keeps scanned invoices off an egressing model while keeping
that model for text:

```yaml
premium:
  provider: gemini
  model: gemini-3.1-flash-lite
  input: [text]        # this tier is sent no attachment at all
```

A declaration can only take carriage away. It can never give a provider a lane
its wire lacks — `input: [text, image]` on a binding whose wire has no image
part still carries no image. Omitted means *whatever that provider carries*,
which is what every native binding did before this field existed.

Note this governs what **Margince sends**. Like `profile:`, it is not a claim
about what the endpoint you chose does with what it receives.

- **Omit it to take the provider's own answer**; write `input: [text]` to send a
  tier no attachments at all. An undeclared `openai_compatible`/`vllm` binding
  carries no attachment parts and *refuses* an attachment rather than dropping
  it — the safe default there.
- **Accepted values are `text` and `image`**, and `text` must be present. An
  unknown modality is a startup error naming the accepted set, so a typo cannot
  silently disable the feature it was meant to enable. `pdf` is deliberately not
  accepted: a PDF rides a vendor-proprietary request extension on one gateway
  and nothing at all on a self-hosted endpoint, so the word would mean different
  things per vendor. Scanned PDFs take the text-extraction lane.
- **The `embeddings:` binding does not take it** — that lane sends no
  attachments.
- **A declaration is a claim, not a checked fact.** A binding that claims more
  than its model serves fails on the wire, visibly.

**The ladder cuts both ways.** A task's carriage is the *intersection* over its
bound rungs, because the budget guardrail can demote a call to a lower rung
mid-month. So *enabling* a lane needs the declaration on **every** rung — one
undeclared `openai_compatible` sibling vetoes it for the whole task — while
*narrowing* one rung narrows the whole task, which is exactly what you want when
the narrowing is the privacy intent. Look a candidate's own answer up before
declaring it; on OpenRouter:

```sh
curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.id=="<slug>") | .architecture.input_modalities'
```

A cloud binding is refused at startup under `profile: sovereign` (zero
egress by construction) — and so is a **local provider pointed at somebody
else's host**, because the provider name alone would let a deployment declare
zero egress and send every call over the public internet. Under that profile
each binding's resolved `base_url` (an omitted one is the provider default,
which is loopback) must name an address on infrastructure you control:
loopback, link-local, or a private range (`10.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`,
or an IPv6 unique-local address). **A private-range host on another machine
counts** — your own GPU box is your own infrastructure. A **DNS name is
refused** even when it looks internal: resolving it at boot says only where it
pointed at boot, and a profile satisfied by an answer that can change an hour
later is not a guarantee. Use the IP, or `localhost`.

An editor with a YAML language server picks up
[`config/margince.schema.json`](../../config/margince.schema.json)
(referenced from the shipped configs' first line) for autocomplete, enum
validation, and hover docs across the WHOLE file rather than the routing block
alone; the parser remains the sole runtime authority.

The `embeddings:` binding also takes `dimensions` — the vector width the
provider is asked to emit. Default `1536` (a gemini-recommended width); the
embedding column is unbounded, so any width in range is stored without a
migration. `0` or omitted means the default. An operator-set value validates
into `[1, 2000]` (`ai.ParseRouting`) — out of range is a boot error, never a
runtime one. Changing `dimensions` (or the provider/model) needs **no
migration**: the embedding column is unbounded `vector`, so a config edit +
restart (`make dev`) takes effect immediately — the next ingress and query
both use the new width. Existing rows stay stamped under the old identity
until re-embedded; see below.

### Embedding binding changes & reindex

Every embedding row is stamped with the identity (provider/model@dimensions)
it was written under. On boot, the seed step plants the deployment's
`embed_store_binding` marker at the configured identity; if the store was
already populated under a **different** one — an operator changed the
binding since the last boot — that mismatch is logged at **error** level (an
admin must see it) and boot still succeeds. Search stays available
throughout: vector ranking filters to the **current** identity (stale-identity
rows are excluded, not queried at the wrong width), and the lexical/FTS arm
and any already-current rows keep answering queries. Reindexing onto the new
identity is a deliberate ops action, never something boot forces.

The mismatch surfaces two ways: `/readyz`'s `embed:` line (`active` |
`needs_reindex` | `reembedding` | `unknown` — the last when no embed lane is
bound or the marker read fails; it never makes `/readyz` return 503) and an
admin/ops-only banner in the frontend shell. Reconciling runs through three **human-only** routes
(`x-agent-access: human-only` — a passport/agent principal never reaches
them):

- `GET /embeddings/reindex/status` — the binding marker plus a live
  per-workspace pending-entity scan; admin/ops-only (the
  `embedding_reindex` object's `read` grant — manager/rep/read_only hold no
  grant and the request 403s, matching the ops-gated banner that consumes
  it).
- `GET /embeddings/reindex/preview` — the scope before the spend:
  fleet-wide and per-workspace pending counts plus a cost estimate (always
  `heuristic` — a work-shape token figure, never priced from observed
  `ai_call` history) and each workspace's advisory budget-utilization
  impact. Admin/ops-only, the same `read` grant as the status route. The
  embed lane itself is budget-exempt (routing never queues or degrades it),
  so this is disclosure only, never a block.
- `POST /embeddings/reindex` — admin/ops-gated (the `embedding_reindex`
  object's `update` grant). Claims the binding marker (`idle` →
  `reembedding`) and enqueues one fleet-wide re-embed job, resumable by
  construction (a content-hash + identity skip-compare makes revisiting an
  already-current row free); one live reindex at a time (`409
  reindex_running`).

Correctness never depends on a reindex finishing: retrieval filters to the
current identity, so rows still under a stale identity are simply hidden
from search until re-embedded, never served as if current.

Two operator gotchas, verified against current vendor docs:

1. **Not every `openai_compatible` vendor serves the embeddings lane.**
   OpenRouter does — `/v1/embeddings`, with the catalog at
   `GET /api/v1/embeddings/models` — while chat-only vendors such as Groq
   and DeepSeek 404. Bind `embeddings:` to a vendor that has the lane
   (`gemini`, `openai`, Mistral, OpenRouter) or a local model (ollama
   `bge-m3`). On `openai_compatible` the adapter deliberately never sends
   `dimensions`, so the configured width must EQUAL the model's native
   width; a binding that returns another width fails loudly.
2. **Vendor `-latest` model aliases drift and some are being deprecated**
   (e.g. Mistral). Pin an explicit versioned id, or resolve via the
   vendor's `/models` endpoint, rather than hardcoding an alias.
