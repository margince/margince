-- One-time database bootstrap. Run ONCE against your Postgres as a superuser
-- BEFORE the first api deploy, then never again. For example:
--
--   psql "postgres://postgres:…@<host>:5432/postgres" \
--     -v owner_pw="$OWNER_PW" -v app_pw="$APP_PW" -f scripts/deploy/db-bootstrap.sql
--
-- Pass the two role passwords RAW (not pre-quoted) as psql variables so they
-- never land in this committed file — `:'…'` + `%L` quote and escape them. They
-- MUST match the passwords embedded in the app's MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN / MARGINCE_DSN.
--
-- Why two non-superuser roles: the runtime holds DML grants only, and a
-- superuser ignores every grant — so the wall between what serves traffic and
-- what applies DDL exists only while neither role is exempt. The api refuses to
-- serve on an exempt runtime role (compose.AssertRuntimeRole).
--   * margince_owner — owns the database + tables, runs migrations (DDL). Not a
--     superuser, no BYPASSRLS.
--   * margince_app   — the runtime role the api/worker connect as. Its table
--     grants are applied by migration 0015_app_role_grants, which is a no-op
--     unless the role already exists — hence it is created here, first.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run (each step guards on existence).

-- The two roles. psql does NOT interpolate `:'var'` inside a dollar-quoted
-- DO $$…$$ body, so the guarded CREATE ROLE is built in a plain SELECT (where
-- interpolation DOES happen) and run with \gexec. `format(… %L …)` safely quotes
-- the password; the WHERE NOT EXISTS makes each idempotent (an existing role
-- yields no row, so \gexec runs nothing). Neither role is a superuser or granted
-- BYPASSRLS — their grants must bind them.

-- The runtime app role (mirrors scripts/db-init.sql for local dev).
SELECT format('CREATE ROLE margince_app LOGIN PASSWORD %L', :'app_pw')

-- guards above skip a role that already exists, so a pre-existing margince_app /
-- margince_owner could otherwise retain SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS and silently
-- ignore its own grants. These ALTERs are idempotent and cost nothing on a fresh role
-- (CREATE ROLE already defaults to NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS).
