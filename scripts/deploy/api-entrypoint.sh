# as the APP role. Deployment-target-agnostic — every setting is read from the
# environment (the MARGINCE_* vars in docs/reference/configuration.md); the api
# resolves --config/--dsn/--redis/--public-base-url from their env
# fallbacks, so no flags are needed here.
#
# The two DB roles + the database are created ONCE, out of band, by
# scripts/deploy/db-bootstrap.sql — the app role holds DML grants only and a
# superuser ignores every grant, so the app must never connect as one and this
# container holds no superuser credential.

# different path changes it in margince.yaml and here together, and one knob is
# fewer things to keep in agreement than two.
