# check-contract-frontend-drift.sh — the frontend's generated types are part of
# the contract, so the BACKEND gate has to notice when they are stale.
#
# Editing backend/api/crm.yaml requires three regenerations. `make check-backend`
# used to enforce one:
#
#   make gen        → internal/contracts, compose stubs, agentpolicy, recordshapes
#                     — enforced by the backend `drift` gate
#   pnpm gen:api    → frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts + public-events.ts
#                     — enforced ONLY by the frontend lane's fe-drift leg
#   -update-mcp-info → the published MCP surface docs
#                     — enforced by a unit test in check-backend
#
# A DIFFERENT contract, backend/api/ai-tasks.yaml, has its own published
# artifact and its own regeneration — listed here only so the two are not
# confused, since this leg does NOT check it:
#
#   -update-agent-tool-budget → docs/reference/agent-tool-budget.{json,md}, what
#                     each scheduled agent's tool listing costs its window
#                     — enforced by a unit test in check-backend, same shape
#
# `make gen` has no frontend reference at all, and a backend-only author has no
# reason to run the lane that would catch the second. So a contract change could
# go green through the whole backend gate and strand the frontend types — which
# is not hypothetical: it put main red for a day (#1573), and the trail ran from
# two screens the author never opened back to an audit-action contract change two
# PRs earlier, as a dozen TS2322 lines naming properties that exist.
#
# The Makefile already STATED this invariant in frontend-check's own comment
# while enforcing it nowhere. This makes the claim true rather than softening it.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHERE IT DOES NOT. This is the LOCAL half. CI already
# covers the same ground from the other side and it is worth being exact about
# which, because #1639 assumed otherwise:
#
#   - CI's `fe-quality` job runs `make fe-drift`, and the change classifier
#     routes `backend/api/**` to the frontend lane — so a contract change on a
#     pull request does meet this check there.
#   - CI's `deterministic-gates` job, which runs `make check-backend`, installs
#     Go and nothing else. There is no pnpm on it and it does not need one.
#
# So the environment this leg exists for is a developer's: `make check-backend`
# or the pre-push hook, where a backend-only author never runs the lane that
# would catch it. That is exactly the gap #1639 describes.
#
# The CI half is not left to trust either — it is pinned by
# TestTheContractReachesTheFrontendLane (backend/gates/contractfrontendlane_test.go),
# which fails when the classifier stops routing `backend/api/**` to the
# frontend lane. Dropping that one line is what would actually reopen #1573,
# and it would otherwise be invisible.
#
# THE TRAP THIS GATE IS ITSELF EXPOSED TO. It has to be skippable, because the
# backend lane must run on a bare Go checkout — and a gate that skips cleanly is
# a gate that can skip silently, which is the same defect one level up. Two rules
# hold it shut, and each is tested by check-contract-frontend-drift.test.sh:
#
#   1. The skip is LOUD. It names the leg, the reason and the artifacts it did
#      not check, on stderr, every time. Its only trigger is pnpm's absence, so
#      an environment that HAS pnpm cannot skip.
#   2. Census, not verdict. `pnpm gen:api` is required to have actually REWRITTEN
#      every artifact named below before the diff is trusted. A generator that
#      silently wrote nothing and a tree with no drift produce the same clean
#      diff, and "checked nothing successfully" must not read as green.
