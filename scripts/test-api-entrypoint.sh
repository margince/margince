# test-api-entrypoint.sh — prove the container entrypoint never leaves a
# plaintext bootstrap credential at rest on a provisioned installation.
#
# ADR-0061 §2 consumes bootstrap values exactly once, and the entrypoint is the
# only thing standing between MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD and a file on disk. Before
# the probe existed it rewrote that file on EVERY container start, for the life
# of the installation, so the deletability the file design rests on held only if
# an operator remembered to unset a variable that nothing checked.
#
# What makes this worth a test rather than a reading: every failure here is
# silent. A credential written to a provisioned installation looks exactly like
# one that was not; a probe that errors and is read as "unprovisioned" looks
# exactly like a fresh install. The entrypoint runs in a container nobody
# watches, and none of these paths raises anything a deployment would notice.
#
# `margince-migrate` and `margince-api` are stubbed on PATH — this tests the
# ENTRYPOINT's decisions, and running real migrations would test the database.

# --password leaves MARGINCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD unset in the child, which is the
# state a fresh deployment that bootstraps by other means is actually in.
