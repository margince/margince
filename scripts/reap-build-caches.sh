# reap-build-caches.sh — delete the Go build caches that nothing can restore.
#
# `.github/actions/go-build-cache` keys every entry
# `go-build-<flavor>-<os>-<arch>-<deps-hash>-<commit-sha>` and falls back through
# `restore-keys` to the newest entry sharing the deps hash. So within one deps
# hash only the NEWEST entry is ever read: every older one is unreachable by
# construction, and the only thing it can still do is take up room.
#
# Room is the problem. A repository gets 10 GB of Actions cache, and one push to
# main writes about 5 GB of Go build cache across the two flavours. Two
# generations fill the quota on their own, and GitHub then evicts by
# least-recently-used — which reaches the small entries first, because
# node-cache, gate-binaries and setup-go are read once per run each while a 3 GB
# build cache is read by every Go job. The cheap caches are evicted by the
# expensive ones, and the lanes that depended on them quietly get slower.
#
# So this deletes the superseded generations rather than waiting for eviction to
# choose worse victims. It is deliberately narrow: only `go-build-` keys, only
# entries that are not the newest of their deps hash. Everything else — including
# an older deps hash, which restore-keys CAN still fall back to after a go.sum
# bump — is left alone.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 prints the plan and deletes nothing.
