# Published-surface freeze gate (ADR-0069 §3, EXT-P3; the ADR-0023
# Amendment 2 patch-lane arm): backend/pkg is frozen published API from
# its first release — it evolves additively or through versioned
# successors, never in place. This gate apidiffs every published package
# against the merge target and reports every INCOMPATIBLE change
# (removed package, removed or re-signatured symbol, narrowed interface);
# additive growth always passes.
#
# TWO REGIMES, derived from the tree (no config):
#   advisory — before the first v1+ release tag exists: the surface is
#     design-fluid, incompatible changes print as ADVISORY and never
#     block. What you see is what v1.0.0 will freeze.
#   enforce  — from the first v1+ tag: incompatible changes FAIL. A
#     ratified change is recorded in the allowlist as its exact apidiff
#     finding BOUND to the merge-base sha it was ratified against (the
#     gate prints the ready-to-paste line): once the ratifying PR
#     merges, every future merge-base differs, so an entry can never
#     license a recurring same-text finding or pre-authorize a future
#     break. Superseded/unused entries warn until removed. Package
#     REMOVALS are never allowlistable (deprecate-then-major cycle).
# PKG_FREEZE_MODE=advisory|enforce overrides (testing the other regime).
#
# Baseline: the PR's merge target (origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF in CI); the
# local approximation is the extensions integration branch while the
# arc holds there, else origin/main. PKG_FREEZE_BASE=<ref> overrides.
