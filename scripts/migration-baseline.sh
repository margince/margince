# The schema a migration namespace BUILDS, as a comparable artifact.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `backend/migrations/core/` is a baseline plus whatever has
# landed since, and the tracking table records a version, not a checksum — so
# nothing in the tree says what schema the namespace is supposed to produce.
# That gap is what let a consolidation be unreviewable: a squashed baseline is
# only trustworthy if "the baseline builds the same schema the history built" is
# a statement somebody can run, and it is the same statement as "this migration
# changed the schema in exactly this way".
#
#   verify REF build one database from REF's migrations and one from this
#              tree's, and diff the two schemas. Empty is the only pass. This is
#              what makes a baseline consolidation reviewable; it is also how
#              the NEXT consolidation gets checked.
#
# For the everyday question — did the migration I just wrote change head, and
# how — the gate is TestMigrationsBuildTheCommittedSchema against
# backend/migrations/testdata/head_catalog.txt, which needs only a database
# connection. This script is the heavier tool, for comparing two migration
# HISTORIES rather than a history against a committed expectation.
#
# pg_dump runs INSIDE the Postgres container, never on the host. A host pg_dump
# is whatever the developer's package manager installed — 18.2 against a 16.14
# server here — and a newer pg_dump emits SQL shaped for the newer server, so
# the artifact would differ per machine while describing one schema.
