# verify-boot.sh — the scripted boot proof: a running stack really serves
# a login, the seeded demo data, and a buildable frontend.
#
# Pure client by design: the caller owns the stack lifecycle (`make dev`
# in one terminal, `make seed-dev` once) the same way CI's live-boot job
# does — this script only proves the result. It fails loudly on the first
# broken step and never skips a check: a green run means a human can log
# in and see data right now.
#
# Steps:
#   1. POST /v1/auth/login with the seeded demo admin → 200 + crm_session.
#   2. GET /v1/people under that session → the three seeded people.
#   3. Every composed unit's declared channel transport is published by
#      GET /v1/channel-providers — the boot step really ran.
#   4. The frontend production build compiles (pnpm build) — a real
#      compile+bundle, not a stale-dist check.
