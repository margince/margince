-- seed-reset.sql — wipe the demo installation's workspace so
-- `make seed-dev` can rebuild it from scratch. Run by `make seed-reset`
-- against the compose stack's Postgres.
--
-- Deletes every row scoped to the demo workspace across all tenant tables
-- (those with a workspace_id column), discovered dynamically so a new
-- table is covered without touching this file.
--
-- session_replication_role = replica disables FK enforcement and triggers
-- for the duration, so the deletes are order-independent. That includes
-- audit_log's append-only guard — correct here, because the reset erases
-- the whole tenant, history included. Requires superuser (the compose
-- stack's margince_owner is one).
