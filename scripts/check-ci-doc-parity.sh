# check-ci-doc-parity.sh — every path a workflow filters on is named in the prose
# that documents it.
#
# The same path lists live in two places: the workflow, which decides what runs,
# and the document a reader consults to decide where a change belongs. Nothing
# held them together, and both directions of drift have already happened here — a
# path added to a filter and left out of the table, and a whole passage describing
# a syft exclude list that had been deleted. The second is the reason this exists:
# a stale document does not merely fail to help, it argues confidently for the
# wrong thing, and a real gate finding read as impossible for exactly as long as
# someone believed it.
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES: a path present in a workflow filter and absent from its
# document. That is the direction with teeth — an undocumented scope sends the
# next reader to the wrong place.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, deliberately: the reverse, a path removed from a
# filter while the document still lists it. Checking that means teaching this
# script every shorthand the prose is allowed to use, and a gate whose rules are
# fiddly is a gate that gets worked around rather than fixed. A leftover entry
# misleads a reader; a missing one hides a gate that silently never runs. This
# guards the worse of the two, and says so rather than implying it guards both.
