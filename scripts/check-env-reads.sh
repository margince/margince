# Environment-read gate with a ratchet (plus a waiver list). OPS-CFG-2: config
# is read ONCE at the composition root into a typed, validated struct, and
# everything below it receives its slice by dependency injection rather than
# reaching for the environment itself. A read under backend/internal is
# therefore a package deciding its own configuration, which makes that
# configuration invisible to the process that is supposed to own it — and
# untestable without mutating the environment.
#
# Exempt, for reasons that are categorical rather than historical:
#   - cmd/**            the composition roots; reading the environment is their job
#   - *_test.go         a test may stage its own environment
#   - //go:build integration
#                       the real-infra lane's harnesses (apptest, testdb,
#                       redistest, the integration harness) read MARGINCE_TEST_*
#                       to find the cluster they were pointed at; they ARE the
#                       composition root of that lane
#   - platform/config   the seam itself: the ONE os.Getenv the product holds, so
#                       that every package below the root can take a Lookup
#                       instead of reaching for the environment. Exempting it is
#                       what makes the rule satisfiable at all
#   - platform/cliflags the flag-to-environment binder itself. It reads the
#                       environment on behalf of a composition root that asked
#                       it to, which is the mechanism this rule presumes, not a
#                       violation of it
#
# The ratchet: scripts/env-read-waivers.txt records each pre-existing offender
# with its frozen count of reads. A waived file may shrink but never grow; once
# it reaches zero, its entry must be REMOVED so the file is covered for good.

# Every way the standard library hands out the environment, not just the one
# spelling in the tree today: a gate that matches os.Getenv alone is satisfied
# by rewriting the call as os.LookupEnv, which reads the same value.
#
# The leading boundary keeps the match to the `os` package itself. Without it a
# receiver whose name merely ENDS in os — myos.Getenv(, _os.LookupEnv( — is read
# as a violation, and a gate that cries wolf gets waived rather than fixed.
