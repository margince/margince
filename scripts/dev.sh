# One-command local dev stack on the ONE shared infra: Postgres + Redis, the api
# (cmd/api), the background worker (cmd/worker — outbox relay + Surface-B runner),
# and the Vite dev server — so the SPA runs in a real browser against a live api.
# One stack per WORKTREE, so several agent sessions can run at once. The primary
# worktree serves the app on :8080 (the api behind it on :18080) against the
# shared `margince` database; every linked worktree derives its own slug from
# its directory name and claims its own database, Redis logical database, port
# pair and object bucket — no flag to remember. `DEV_SLUG=<slug>` overrides the
# derived name.
#
# MARGINCE_ENV=dev relaxes the production-only postures (an unlicensed install
# warns rather than refuses, the data reset is reachable). It does NOT switch on
# a workspace header: one installation serves one organization (ADR-0061), the
# server resolves it itself, and no request selects a tenant. localhost is a
# browser secure-context, so the Secure session cookie survives over plain
# http — no TLS front door needed.
#
# BYOK: if .env.local sets a cloud key (GEMINI_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY /
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY), sourcing it exports the var and
# the api/worker inherit it — SelectBrain reads the key from the environment at
# boot (the routing file holds only providers), so the cold-start read-back runs
# the real model; otherwise the offline fake (--ai-fake) drives it.
#
# Credentials are NOT hardcoded: the connection URLs derive from OWNER_DSN /
# APP_DSN, which fall back to the MARGINCE_OWNER_DSN / MARGINCE_DSN the binaries
# themselves read before reaching the compose defaults — so this script carries
# no secret literal beyond the shared dev defaults, and there is one set of names
