# seed-demo-company.sh — one company with every card on its record page filled.
#
# The company record page shows a card only when it has something true to say,
# so on a freshly imported account most of them correctly stay empty or absent.
# That is right, and it makes the page impossible to LOOK at: there is no way
# to see the design at full density without an account that has been running
# for a while.
#
# This builds that account. Everything with an API goes through the API — the
# deals, the contacts, the activities — because a hand-inserted row the real
# writer never produces proves nothing and drifts the moment the writer
# changes. Only the accounting CONNECTION is written directly, because there is
# no endpoint to connect a source yet; the invoices behind it are then produced
# by the real sync, not by this file.
#
# Idempotent: re-running adopts what an earlier run created.
#
# Usage:  scripts/seed-demo-company.sh [company-name]

# The stack THIS worktree runs, not whatever holds :8080. Both halves resolve
