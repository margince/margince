# test-laneorder.sh — unit test for scripts/lib-laneorder.sh, the parallel
# integration lane's dispatch order.
#
# The order is a scheduling hint, so getting it wrong never turns a lane red —
# it just makes the run longer, or, in the case this exists to catch, shorter
# for the packages that do not matter and longer for the one that does. That
# silence is the whole reason for a test: a regression here is invisible on
# every dashboard and shows up only as a lane that drifted back to costing what
# it cost before the hint was added.
#
# Three properties, each of which has a failure mode nothing else would report:
#   1. a named package sorts by its recorded duration, longest first;
#   2. an UNNAMED package keeps the order it arrived in — a stale baseline must
#      degrade to no-hint behaviour, not to an order the sort invented;
#   3. the measured hint beats the committed baseline, and an empty or missing
#      file is not a hint at all.
