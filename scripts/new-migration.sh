# Scaffold a core migration pair named for the current unix second.
#
# WHY THE CLOCK AND NOT THE NEXT NUMBER. A sequential name is picked against
# whatever `main` looked like when the branch opened, so two branches open at
# once pick the SAME number and `main` stops loading the moment both merge —
# `pgmigrate: duplicate version 0240`, which is not a partially-migrated
# database but no migration at all, because the loader rejects the whole
# namespace before applying anything. That happened twice in two days (0240,
# then 0248). A clock reading is unique without consulting a base ref, and it
# still sorts in the order the migrations were written, which is the order
# pgmigrate applies them.
#
# THE 4-DIGIT SEQUENCE 0001-0292 IS CLOSED, NOT RENAMED. A version already
# recorded in a database's schema_migrations_core cannot be renamed without
# stranding that database — dbmigrate.assertLedgerMatches refuses to continue,
# by design, because the migration in that slot would otherwise be skipped as
# done forever. The two eras coexist because every version in that sequence is
# ZERO-PADDED and so sorts below any ten-digit stamp — not because ten digits
# beat four, which is false ("9999" sorts above "1787000000").
#
# Stamping the clock removes collisions, not the ordering obligation: a
# migration must still sort after everything on the base ref, so a branch that
# sat while another migration merged re-runs this script and moves its SQL to
# the fresh pair. check-migration-versions.sh is what reports that.
#
# Usage: new-migration.sh <name>     e.g. new-migration.sh add_renewal_risk
