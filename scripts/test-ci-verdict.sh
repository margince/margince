# beside the reporter: the verdict can only be observed exiting 0, and "the check
# was green" is precisely the signal that was already untrustworthy. The case
# that matters most is the one that must FAIL — a skipped job on `merge_group` —
# because GitHub counts a skipped required check as a passing one, and that is
# the hole this script exists to close. A verdict that admitted a skip there
# would look identical to a working one on every dashboard.
