# test-dev-dsn.sh — prove the dev stack resolves its DSNs the way the product
# does, and that doing so did not widen what an isolated stack can reach.
#
# `make dev` passes --dsn explicitly, which OUTRANKS the environment the
# binaries would otherwise read. That is why the resolution has to happen HERE,
# and why it is worth a test: the failure it replaces was a value set in
# .env.local that looked meaningful and did nothing for the whole dev stack.
#
# What must survive honouring MARGINCE_DSN, all three from #1252:
#   1. DEV_SLUG keeps owning the database NAME. A stack that inherited the name
#      from a supplied DSN would sit on slug-derived ports in front of the BASE
#      database — two stacks that look isolated quietly sharing one.
#   2. --fresh still refuses a redirected owner DSN, compared against the
#      EFFECTIVE value rather than the literal default.
#   3. A DSN is never echoed. It carries a password.
