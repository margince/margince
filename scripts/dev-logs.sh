# tags and the severity, and hides the job-queue heartbeat that otherwise buries
# the signal.

# It is a DEV convenience only. The servers' own output is unchanged — plain
# key=value text (or json via --log-format) with no ANSI in it — because that is
# what a production log collector ingests. Nothing here runs outside `make dev`.
