# check-host-ports.sh — fail if any host port published by the dev compose stack
# sits inside Linux's default ephemeral range (32768–60999).
#
# Why this is a gate and not a comment: a port in that range is not ours to bind.
# The kernel draws from it for the SOURCE port of every outbound connection
# (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`), so any unrelated process on the host —
# a docker pull, `go mod download`, the CI runner's own agent — can transiently
# hold one as a client port. Compose then fails with
#   failed to bind host port for 0.0.0.0:<port>: address already in use
# and, being a race, it presents as a flake that names whichever step happened to
# call `make db-up` rather than the port that actually lost. That is expensive to
# read and cheap to prevent, and the only thing preventing it is the choice of
# number — which is exactly the kind of constraint a comment stops enforcing the
# first time somebody picks a memorable port.
#
# Checks the HOST side of `"<host>:<container>"` only. The container port is
# inside the container's own namespace and is unaffected.

# that clears it clears a narrowed range too.
