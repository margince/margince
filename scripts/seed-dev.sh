#
# The seed is an API client, not a SQL fixture, on purpose: passwords
# are salted Argon2id, and every record write must commit domain row +
# audit_log + event_outbox in one transaction. A SQL fixture would
# duplicate all of that and silently drift from the schema; the API
# cannot.
#
# Pure client: the stack must already be running (`make dev`). Idempotent:
# a re-run logs in instead of re-bootstrapping, and re-creating a record
# that already exists answers 409 on its natural key (person email, org
# domain, deal name checked via list), which counts as "already seeded".
#
# Bootstrap happens at api boot from the deployment configuration
# (A107/ADR-0061: `make dev` writes .tmp/dev/*/margince.yaml with these
# demo credentials) — this script only signs in and seeds records.
