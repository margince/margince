# The person record page's demo account, seeded through the API.
#
# It is an API client for the same reason seed-dev.sh is: every record write
# must commit domain row + audit_log + event_outbox in one transaction, and
# captured_by is stamped from the authenticated principal. A SQL fixture would
# duplicate all of that and drift from the schema — and a page filled by rows
# the real writer never produces proves nothing about the real writer.
#
# It seeds ONE account in two states, which are the two mockups:
#
#   Sarah Cole  (active, meeting ahead)  — State A
#   Nadia Ferreira (gone quiet)          — State B
#
# Both hang off the same company so the buying committee has somebody in it.
# Idempotent: a re-run reports what is already present and changes nothing.
