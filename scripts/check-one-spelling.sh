# Choke-point gate: three predicates this tree owns in exactly one place, each
# here because a hand-written second copy already shipped and was wrong.
#
#   1. SQLSTATE. The codes the stores branch on are named once, in
#      platform/database/storekit/sqlstate.go. A literal "23505" at a call
#      site is a second spelling of the same judgement, and the copies drift:
#      one path answers a dedupe hit as a conflict, its sibling as a 500.
#
#   2. CONSTRAINT DISCLOSURE. A CHECK breach is answered by
#      platform/httperr's constraint net, which deliberately names NO field —
#      the only thing that knows one at that depth is the constraint name, and
#      that is our schema. Five modules had each re-spelled the translation to
#      put that name in the caller's `field` slot; one of them also pre-empted
#      the net's 423 for a held activity, telling the caller to fix a value
#      when nothing they could send would work until the retention window
#      closed.
#
#   3. ISO-4217 SHAPE. `values.ValidCurrency` is the Go spelling of the
#      schema's currency CHECK. It had three private copies — a rune loop, a
#      regexp under a different name, and a verbatim copy of the values regexp
#      var under the SAME name.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE IS, AND IS NOT. It is a token scanner, not a proof. It catches
# the SHAPES that actually shipped here, cheaply, on every push. It does not
# understand Go: `scale := int64(100)` and then a divide by `scale` is a real
# instance of defect 1 that it will not see, and the same is true of any of the
# four expressed indirectly enough. Treat a green run as "the four known shapes
# are absent", never as "the invariant holds" — the invariants are held by
# values, storekit and httperr owning them, and by review; this only stops the
# regrowth we have already watched happen.
#
# It reads CODE, not prose: comment text is stripped before matching, so the
# explanations above (and the ones in the source that name each defect) do not
# fail the build while the same token in a literal still does. Tests are out of
# scope — they construct these errors and describe these defects on purpose.
#
# A genuine false positive — `protocolMinor / 100` is not money — is waived in
# source, on the offending line, with a reason:
#
#     x := protocolMinor / 100 // one-spelling-exempt: a protocol version, not money
#
# matching the `// rls-exempt: <reason>` escape scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh
# already uses. scripts/test-check-one-spelling.sh proves each arm fires, each
# arm's waiver works, and the named non-money lookalikes stay silent.

# Every hand-written Go tree. extensions/ and fixtures/ are separate modules but

#
# Overridable so scripts/test-check-one-spelling.sh can point the same regexes
# at a throwaway tree. It plants deliberate defects, and planting them in the

# probe as a finding, and gofmt/license/craft would read it as an unlicensed
# file. The default is the real answer; the override only moves where it looks.
# An overridden root is taken WHOLE, not word-split: the self-test hands this a
# mktemp path, and splitting one that contains a space would silently scan two
# directories that do not exist — a gate reading green over an empty universe.

# The gate reads CODE, so the whole tree is stripped of comments ONCE, into a
# `file:line:content` corpus the three arms then grep. Stripping after grep
# cannot work: grep hands on only the lines that already matched, so the line
# that OPENED a multi-line block comment never arrives and its interior looks
# like code. scripts/test-check-one-spelling.sh plants a three-line block
# comment holding two banned tokens; that case is what forced this shape.
#
# Dropped: a whole-line comment, a trailing ` // …`, an inline /* … */ span,
# and the interior of a multi-line block. A line carrying the waiver marker is
# dropped whole.
#
# There is no residue paragraph here any more, and that is the point. The three
# holes this file used to state — a `/*` inside a string opening a block, a `//`
# inside one truncating the line, a waiver marker inside one silencing it — are
# all closed by scripts/lib-commentscan.awk, which reads a string as a string.
#
# What is left is not stated, it is DETECTED. A construct the scanner cannot
# follow leaves it inside a string at the end of the file, and the run refuses
# by name rather than reporting OK over code it never read. A residue paragraph
