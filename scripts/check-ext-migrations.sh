# The extension migration gate (ADR-0069): every enabled unit's migrations are
# applied as its restricted ext_<name> role against a throwaway clone, and the
# resulting catalog is checked against the allowlist. See
# backend/tools/extmigrategate for what is asserted and why.
#
# This is the ONE gate in the extension tier that is not textual, and it is the
# only one that can refuse what a scanner cannot see (a CREATE TABLE inside a
# DO block, a policy that reads USING (true), an index colliding with another
# unit's table). gen-composition's pre-apply rule names it as the closing gate
# for exactly those.
#
# DATABASE POSTURE. check-backend is otherwise the hermetic lane, and this
# script keeps it that way for as long as no unit ships migrations: a tree
# where no extensions/*/migrations directory exists exits 0 before touching
# Postgres. The first unit that DOES ship one makes the lane need the test
# cluster, which is deliberate — a migration nobody applied is a migration
# nobody checked — and CI runs the deterministic gates with Postgres up.

# extmigrategate applies each unit's migrations itself and assumes it starts
# from an empty ext schema ("the database is thrown away after one run and
# always starts empty", tools/extmigrategate/main.go). Since cmd/migrate began
# applying the composed set, a database migrated under the COMPOSED workspace
# already holds ext.ext_<name>_* for every unit shipping a layer — the very
# units this gate is about to apply — and the gate would fail on
# `relation already exists`. The shared margince_test template is exactly such
# a database whenever `make test-db-up` or the integration lane touched it
# last, which makes the old clone-the-template posture depend on what ran
# before it. Migrating a fresh database under the ROOT workspace makes the
# gate's premise structurally true instead of incidentally true, and stops a
# `make check` run mutating the template as a side effect.
