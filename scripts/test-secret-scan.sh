# test-secret-scan.sh — prove the secret gate still catches.
#
# A scan policy can only fail by being too permissive, and an over-broad
# allowlist is invisible: it reports the same "no leaks found" as a clean tree.
# So every allowlist in .gitleaks.toml is re-checked here — plant a credential
# in a file it covers, and the scan must still fail.
#
# TWO properties, and the second is the one a single plant cannot reach:
#
#   (a) an allowlist does not hide ANOTHER rule's finding. A global
#       `[[allowlists]]` carrying `paths` makes gitleaks skip the whole file
#       before it reads a line, so `condition` never narrows it and the
#       exemption widens to everything in the file. `targetRules` is what keeps
#       the file scanned. Both scoped entries were written the wrong way first.
#
#   (b) an allowlist does not hide ITS OWN rule's finding on a line its regex
#       does not match. Nothing about (a) implies this, and it is the property
#       "the file stays scanned for everything else" is read as promising.
#       Measured: dropping `targetRules`, `regexes`, or `condition = "AND"`
#       each widens a scoped exemption to the whole file for its own rule.
#
# The plants are DERIVED from the policy rather than listed. A hand-kept list
# goes stale the first time somebody adds an allowlist, and an allowlist nobody
# planted against is exactly the one that is over-broad.
#
# THE SHAPE GATE IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART. Deriving from a file this script
# hand-parses is only safe if anything it cannot fully read is REFUSED, so the
# policy is held to a narrow committed form: no indentation, no tables besides
# [extend] and [[allowlists]], one quoting style per key, and a `paths` on every
# entry. Each rejected shape below was demonstrated to hide a real credential
# while this suite printed ok, so every one of them is a fixed bug rather than
# fastidiousness. A coverage ledger backs the gate up: an allowlist that reaches
# the end of the run with no plant against it fails, whatever went wrong.
#
# The tokens are generated per run rather than written down — a literal here
# would be a credential-shaped string in the repo — and each is PROVED to trip
# its rule before it is trusted: a random high-entropy string lands under the
# generic-api-key floor often enough to redden roughly one run in fifty.
