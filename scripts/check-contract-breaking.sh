# Contract-drift gate, breaking-change half.
# Severity-classifies every change to backend/api/crm.yaml since the
# base ref and fails on ERR-level (breaking) changes; WARN/INFO-level changes
# (additive, deprecation) pass.
#
# Contract-first cuts both ways: the whole-file drift gate (`make drift`)
# proves the generated Go matches the contract, but nothing proved the
# contract itself stayed compatible. This gate does. A deliberate breaking
# re-sync from the spec repo runs with CONTRACT_STABILITY=pre-live, which
# still prints every breaking change but does not block.
#
# Usage: check-contract-breaking.sh [base-ref]   (default: origin/main)

# only when its embedded module version (`go version -m`) matches the pin,
# so a stale local install can never gate at a version CI does not run;
# anything else falls back to `go run` at the exact version. Bump this pin
# and the Makefile's OASDIFF_VERSION together. The command is an array —
# the binary path may contain spaces, the fallback is three words — and
# an OASDIFF env override still wins, split on words (it names a command,
