# Shared helpers for the parallel integration lanes (test-integration-parallel.sh
# and test-integration-one.sh): parse this repo's owner + app DSNs, clone/drop a
# throwaway per-package database, derive a per-slot MinIO bucket, and resolve the
# per-package test timeout both lanes answer to. Source this; don't execute it.
#
# This repo's clone-per-package test-DB shape:
#   - TWO roles, not one — MARGINCE_TEST_DSN (owner: migrates + seeds) and
#     MARGINCE_TEST_APP_DSN (the RLS-bound app role the stores connect as). A
#     clone must be reachable by both, so we swap the db segment of each.
#   - Clones are copied from a migrated template (margince_test), CREATE DATABASE
#     ... TEMPLATE — a fast file copy. This repo has two kinds of integration
#     package: the compose/e2e suites migrate the database themselves, but the
#     module suites (people, agents, consent, identity) assume an already-migrated
#     database and only seed their own rows. A migrated template satisfies both:
#     the module suites get their schema for free, and the self-migrating suites
#     rebuild it once per process (harness migrate-once) — either way correct. The
#     template's migrations grant the cluster-level margince_app role USAGE + table
#     privileges (migration 0015), which the clone inherits, so the app role can
#     connect and query without any per-clone GRANT.
#   - Redis is a single shared instance, isolated by logical db rather than by
#     instance: the parallel runner assigns each package its own index through
#     MARGINCE_TEST_REDIS_DB and every Redis-using fixture reads it through
#     testdb.RedisDB. More than one package touches Redis now, and the ones that
#     do FLUSHDB between tests — so a shared index is a corruption, not
#     contention. See REDIS_DBS in scripts/test-integration-parallel.sh.

# The lane's CONNECTION budget, and it is a product the way the lock budget in
# infra/docker-compose.dev.yml is.
#
# Concurrent packages run against ONE server, and each opens pools sized by
# database.NewPool's fallback — 16 per pool whenever nothing says otherwise.
# Nothing related the two numbers, so the demand was
# jobs x (however many pools a package happens to open) x 16, against a server
# whose max_connections nobody had ever set: the stock 100. At CI's 16 jobs that
# is a ceiling of 256 for the shared pools alone. It passed anyway, because
# MaxConns is a ceiling and not a reservation — pgxpool dials lazily, so whether
# a run fits under 100 was decided by how the bursts happened to overlap, which
# is precisely the reported symptom: connect-time failures in a DIFFERENT
# package set every run, green in isolation, green at INTEGRATION_JOBS=3 (#1109).
#
# The terms below make the demand a number the lane can state. They are read
# back by TestTheLaneFitsInsideTheClusterItRunsAgainst
# (backend/laneconnbudget_test.go), which fails `make check` when the committed
# max_connections in infra/docker-compose.dev.yml stops covering them — so the
# arithmetic cannot drift the way it drifted to get here. That test asks THIS
# function for the number rather than re-implementing the expression: two
# spellings of one formula is the shape the whole issue is about.
#
#   LANE_POOL_MAX_CONNS   ceiling for EACH pool the shared harness opens, handed
#                         to it as MARGINCE_TEST_POOL_MAX_CONNS (testdb's
#                         PoolMaxConnsEnv). 8 rather than database.NewPool's 16
#                         because the measured high-water mark for a WHOLE
#                         package at 16 jobs is 16 connections — both shared
#                         pools and every ad-hoc connection together.
#                         It travels as an ENV VAR and not in the DSN: cmd/migrate
#                         and every bare pgx connection a fixture opens parse the
#                         same DSNs with pgx.ParseConfig, which forwards an
#                         unknown pool_* key to the server as a startup parameter
#                         and dies with `FATAL: unrecognized configuration
#                         parameter`.
#   LANE_CONNS_PER_PACKAGE  what one package may hold at once. A SUM, because the
#                         parts are bounded by different things:
#                           2 x LANE_POOL_MAX_CONNS = 16, the two pools testdb
#                             keys by DSN (owner + app) — this part is ENFORCED;
#                           + 8 for everything the pin does not reach. That is
#                             not only the ad-hoc pgx connections a fixture
#                             opens: 49 integration test files build their OWN
#                             pool from the same DSNs, and those keep
#                             database.NewPool's fallback of 16. So this term is
#                             a MEASURED budget, not a proved ceiling — the
#                             high-water mark for one package is 16 with the pin
#                             applied, and 24 is that plus half again. #1744
#                             carries bringing those pools under the pin, which
#                             is what would make this a ceiling.
#                         It must EXCEED the measured peak, not equal it: a
#                         budget equal to its own measurement is not a budget.
#   LANE_FIXED_CONNS      what the lane costs beyond the packages: one admin
#                         connection per slot for CREATE/DROP DATABASE is counted
#                         per job below (cmd/migrate's db verbs open one
#                         connection each, not a pool, and at a slot handover
#                         jobs of them overlap); this covers the template migrate
#                         (2), superuser_reserved_connections (3), and an
#                         operator's own psql or a metrics scrape while the lane
#                         runs (3).

# guard reads these, not a number somebody wrote down once.

# The migrated template every per-package clone is copied from. Exported so the
# xargs -P worker subshells (fresh bash processes) see it — make_clone reads it.
#
# ONE template per machine was a cross-session collision, not a saving. This
# tree is worked in several git worktrees at once by design, and build_template
# recreates the template from scratch: a parallel session on another branch
# rebuilds it underneath you, and your lane then fails wholesale with
# schema-shaped errors that read as your own migration being broken. A linked
# worktree therefore gets its own template, named after itself.
#
# The PRIMARY worktree — and CI, which has no linked worktree — keeps
# `margince_test` unchanged, so nothing about the existing lane moves.
#
# Per WORKTREE rather than per migration-set hash on purpose: migrate_template
# migrates an EXISTING template up incrementally, which is what keeps the
# migration-authoring inner loop fast. A content-addressed name would throw that
# away, since every migration edit would name a database that does not exist yet
# and rebuild the whole schema from scratch.
#
# Underscores, not hyphens: this name is only ever a Postgres identifier, and
# `margince_test_cfg_retire` needs no quoting where `margince_test_cfg-retire`
# would. That is a different constraint from dev.sh's bucket_for_slug, which
# folds the other way for S3 — so the two expressions stay separate rather than
# being unified into one helper that would be wrong for both.
# An answer of "" means the shared `margince_test`, which is also the right
# answer when the question cannot be asked: a tree with no git (a source tarball,
# a container that copied the files in) has no worktrees to collide over, so
# falling back to the shared name is correct rather than merely quiet.
