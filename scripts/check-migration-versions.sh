# Migration-version gate: a migration this branch adds claims a version no
# migration on the base ref has already claimed, and sorts after all of them.
#
# WHY A TREE-LOCAL TEST CANNOT CATCH THIS. `TestEmbeddedMigrationNamespacesLoad`
# fails on a duplicate version, and it passed on both PRs that produced this
# outage: each numbered its migration against a `main` that did not yet carry
# the other, so each tree was individually valid and the COLLISION only existed
# in the merge. `main` then could not load its own sequence
# (`pgmigrate: duplicate version 0240`) — which is not a partially-migrated
# database but no migration at all, because the loader rejects the whole
# namespace before applying anything. It happened twice in two days (0240, then
# 0248), so it is a property of numbering against a moving base, not bad luck.
#
# It also stayed invisible: `main`'s own CI reports green whenever its head
# commit is docs-only, because the change classifier skips the backend lane for
# it. The collision surfaced on an unrelated frontend PR whose `live-boot` boots
# the stack.
#
# WHY "AFTER", NOT MERELY "NOT EQUAL". A version BELOW the base's highest is not
# a collision, and is worse than one, but not because it is skipped: pgmigrate
# tests membership (`done[version]`), not a watermark, so a lower version IS
# applied. It is applied in the WRONG PLACE. On a fresh database it runs before
# everything above it; on a database already past that number it runs after,
# since those are recorded and skipped. The same set of migrations then produces
# two schemas whenever anything in it is order-dependent — a later ALTER of the
# table this one creates, a CHECK this one widens, a backfill reading a column
# added above it — and nothing reports the difference. `down` diverges too: it
# reverts by VERSION order, so on the second database `migrate down --steps 1`
# reverts the highest version, which is not the migration last applied. The fix
# in both cases is the same and is cheap: re-stamp above the base and rebase.
#
# WHY THE GATE OUTLIVED THE NUMBERING IT WAS BUILT FOR. core/ now names a
# migration for the unix second it was written, so two branches no longer pick
# one version — but stamping the clock only removes the COLLISION, never the
# ordering obligation above, which is a property of what a database already
# applied and not of how the name was chosen. A branch that sat while another
# migration merged still sorts below the base and still has to re-stamp.
#
# The namespace list is derived from the tree (backend/migrations/*/), not
# hand-maintained, so a third namespace is gated the day it appears. Every
# shape in the tree works: custom's YYYYMMDDHHMMSS stamp, core's unix seconds,
# and core's zero-padded baseline version — which the ten-digit stamps sort above
# — all compare as strings, the same ordering pgmigrate itself applies.

# A BASELINE CONSOLIDATION is the one change this gate cannot judge on version
# numbers alone.
#
# Squashing a namespace into a baseline reuses its lowest versions under new
# names — that is the point, because a database whose ledger records the old name
# at that version must be STOPPED rather than migrated forward, and
# dbmigrate.assertLedgerMatches is what stops it. To this gate that is
# indistinguishable from the outage it exists to report: version 0001 claimed by
# two different migrations.
#
# A consolidation therefore DECLARES itself with MIGRATION_VERSIONS_BASELINE_RESET=1.
# The declaration is not taken at its word.
#
# WHY IT IS CHECKED, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN USUALLY. A declaration
# that is merely believed has to be REMOVED once the consolidation lands, and
# whoever forgets has left this gate reporting findings it no longer enforces —
# permanently, silently, and looking green. CI's environment is a committed file,
# so "set it for one PR" is not a thing the environment can express. So the
# declaration is honored only in the situation it describes, and it goes inert by
# itself: after the consolidation merges, the base IS the baseline, every version
# keeps its name, and the check below refuses the declaration on its own.
#
# THE CHECK, in two parts, both required. A consolidation (a) replaces a
# namespace wholesale, so the tree and the base share NO (version, name) pair in
# it, and (b) COLLAPSES, ending with strictly fewer migrations than the base had.
# A broken rebase — the case that would otherwise ride in on the same
# declaration — leaves surviving migrations at the versions and names they
# already had, so it fails (a); and renaming a small namespace's files one for
# one shares nothing but fails (b). Part (b) is also what makes the declaration
# inert after the merge regardless of how few files a namespace has: the base
# then holds exactly what the tree does, so the count cannot fall.
#
# Per namespace, because a branch may consolidate one and not the other.
