// Package crmhello is the walking-skeleton reference extension: the
// smallest unit that exercises the whole stable-tier path —
// scanned from extensions/, composed by gen-composition, reconciled into
// the core registries at boot, enumerated in the boot inventory. The CI
// extension lane copies it under extensions/; the vanilla tree never
// compiles it. Its module path is deliberately non-fetchable: an enabled
// extension resolves through the composed workspace, never a proxy.

// contract the generated composition calls). It exercises both kinds the
// manifest reader distinguishes: a jurisdiction pack (passive policy, no
// manifest entry) and a governed agent tool (a 🟡 risk-tier request that DOES
// appear in manifest.generated.json).
//
// There is no Tools entry, and that is the point. hello_ping is declared in
// api/crm.yaml and nothing here carries behavior for it, so it is a
// CONTRACT-ONLY governed request: it reaches the manifest and the merged
// contract, and the composed surface serves nothing. A Tools entry with a nil
// Handle would declare the same inertness a second time, in the one place that
// exists to say what the unit can actually run.
