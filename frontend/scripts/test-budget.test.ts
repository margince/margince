// The budget that governs every other suite here, gated the only way a budget
// can be: against the thing it has to outlast. Issue 1144 was not a slow test —
// it was a per-test ceiling smaller than the sum of the per-waiter budgets the
// test was allowed to spend, so tests failed with every waiter in them still
// inside its own budget. Nothing in vitest compares those two numbers, which is
// why one drifted under the other unnoticed for as long as it did.
//
// Read from the syntax tree rather than run: a guard that proved the ceiling by
// actually waiting eleven seconds would cost eleven seconds every run and still
// only prove it for the machine it ran on. This costs about half a second and
// proves it for every test in the tree.

/**
 * The two `clickRefresh` cases in `company-context.test.tsx` spend 30s of waiter
 * budget under this suite's ceiling, and they are LEFT that way on purpose. That
 * file carries issue 613 — a panel that does not render even with a 10s waiter,
 * which is starvation rather than this arithmetic — and giving those two a
 * ceiling that covers their waiters would turn its fast red into a slow one and
 * bury the defect being investigated.
 *
 * Keyed by file and test NAME, not by file and not by line. By file would cover
 * forty tests under a reason that describes two, and would silently unguard
 * every test added there later; by line would shift the moment anything is
 * inserted above them — in the one file most likely to be edited, since it is
 * the one still under investigation.
