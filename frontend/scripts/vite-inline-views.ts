// The MCP App inliner: it folds each view's entry chunk and stylesheet into its
// document, stamps the licence header, and refuses to emit anything that reaches
// off-origin.
//
// WHY A DOCUMENT MUST BE SELF-CONTAINED. Each view declares an EMPTY origin
// allowlist, and a host builds its content-security policy from that
// declaration. "This view reaches no network" is therefore a promise kept by
// having no origin to name — so a single <link>, font URL or source-map comment
// the bundler emitted would reintroduce the origin the declaration says is not
// there, and the host would refuse it at render time with nothing here saying
// why.
//
// THERE ARE TWO CHECKS AND THEY ARE NOT ALTERNATIVES. validateDocument runs the
// EXACT token list the Go admission check embeds, over the final bytes: a
// document that passes here can then only be refused in production by tampering
// or version skew, never by the two validators disagreeing about the rules.
// inspectDocument parses the document and judges its nodes, which is what a
// substring sweep cannot do — a meta refresh carries no attribute the token list
// looks for, and `data-theme` looks exactly like `data`.
