// Parsed with the TypeScript compiler rather than matched with a regex. A

// this cannot fold, or a test shape it does not recognise, is the one case that
// matters — the budget it hides is exactly the budget nobody checked. An
// earlier version defaulted an unfoldable `{ timeout: … }` to the smallest
// possible value and walked straight past a live 11000ms violation.
