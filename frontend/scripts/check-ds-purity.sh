# Design-token purity gate for the Ledger-Green token system: every colour in
# hand-written frontend code
# reads a token — literal colours live ONLY in src/design-system/tokens.css,
# where tokens.test.ts pins each value to the design source of truth.
#
# Fails on, anywhere else under frontend/src (*.ts / *.tsx / *.css):
#   1. Hex literals (#abc / #aabbcc / #aabbccdd) — use var(--token)
#   2. Raw colour functions rgb()/rgba()/hsl()/hsla()/oklch() — use a token
#
# This is the fail-closed grep arm on top of the vitest conformance suite
# (design-system/conformance.test.ts): the same discipline holds even if the
# test tree regresses. This DS is CSS-custom-property based, not
# Tailwind-class based, so there are no text-[Npx]/utility-class checks.
#
# Usage: frontend/scripts/check-ds-purity.sh   (wired into `make frontend-check`)

# The unit trees are swept too. A unit's screen is shipped UI in the same
# bundle, rendered on the same page, by an author the core team did not review
# line by line — so a gate that stopped at frontend/src would hold the core to a
# standard the extension tier escapes, which is the wrong way round. EXT_DIR is
# overridable so the gate's own tests can point it at a fixture.

# Excluded: the token source file (literals are its job), generated contract
# types, and test files (fixtures aren't shipped UI).
#
# Plus exactly ONE component, named rather than pattern-matched:
# design-system/provider-mark.tsx carries Google's and Microsoft's own sign-in
# marks. Another company's colours are not ours to tokenise, and a provider mark
# rendered in Ledger Green is a wrong mark. Keep this a NAMED file — widening it
# to a pattern is how a real drift gets in beside it, and the same one entry is
# repeated in conformance.test.ts so both arms of the gate say why.
#
# And exactly ONE piece of scaffolding, on the same terms:
# design-system/tokens-testing.ts is what the token suites READ the sheet with,
# so the `rgba(` in it is the grammar it parses rather than paint it applies. It
# declares no colour of its own; every value it touches arrives from tokens.css.
# It sat inside tokens.test.ts, which the test exclusion above already skipped,
# until a second suite needed the same maths and a copy would have been two
# answers to one question.
