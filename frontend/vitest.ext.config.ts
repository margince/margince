// The unit-screen test lane: vitest over extensions/*/frontend/**/*.test.tsx.
//
// WHY A SECOND CONFIG rather than widening `test.include` in vite.config.ts, or
// declaring two `test.projects` there:
//
//   - Widening the default lane's include is wrong because these suites only
//     PASS composed. A unit screen reads its copy through "@composition/copy",
//     which the vanilla alias resolves to the committed empty registry — so
//     a unit's `t("extOpenchannel.…")` returns the key rather than its copy
//     and every copy assertion below fails. The same is true of the routes it
//     calls: they exist in the merged contract and nowhere else. The unit lane
//     is the COMPOSED lane, exactly as `make fe-typecheck-composed` is, and a
//     lane with a precondition should not be smuggled into the one that has
//     none.
//   - `test.projects` in vite.config.ts would work, but a project entry does
//     not inherit the root config's `plugins`/`resolve` — so expressing it that
//     way means restating react(), tailwindcss() and the whole alias array for
//     the core project too, and the 2230-test lane silently changes shape if
//     one of those restatements drifts. mergeConfig keeps ONE definition of the
//     aliases (`@composition/*` and `@margince-ext/*`) and the setup file, and
//     changes only what this lane needs: which files it collects.
//
// Every alias the base config defines is an ABSOLUTE path built from
// vite.config.ts's own URL, so moving the root below changes nothing about how
// a unit screen resolves `@composition/*`, `@margince-ext/<unit>` or the host's
// deduped React — it resolves through exactly the map the SPA build uses.
//
// Run it with `make fe-test-ext` (composes first), which `make check-fe` calls.

// A SPREAD rather than mergeConfig: mergeConfig concatenates arrays, so an

  // single copy of the hook dispatcher and the QueryClient context. Rooting this
  // lane at the repository root instead breaks exactly that: nothing is
