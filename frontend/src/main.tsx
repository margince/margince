// ignored a dark-mode reader entirely, and inherited a stale attribute after a
// sign-out. Setting it here also avoids a light-to-dark flash on reload for a
// reader who has chosen dark.
//
// It also starts the `prefers-color-scheme` subscription that a reader whose
// choice is "system" is asking for. That belongs at boot rather than to the
// first mounted theme control, because the account menu renders its control
// only while it is open — a tab nobody opened the menu in would otherwise stay

// wrong. Either way the cached answer is stale the moment it is contradicted,
// so refetch it rather than let the offending control sit there until the tab
// next takes focus.

// itself owns no cache. Only /me is invalidated — a 403 says nothing about the
