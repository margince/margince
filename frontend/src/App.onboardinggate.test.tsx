// Two places decide, on their own, where a session belongs when the
// installation has not described itself, and each rewrites the hash to say so:
// AuthedApp's onboarding gate sends every route back to onboarding while
// GET /company answers 404, and the conversational shell's restore
// (screens/onboarding-conversation/restore.ts) decides whether the journey is
// finished and leaves. Those are the only two automatic navigators in the app;
// every other navigate() answers a click.
//
// When they disagree they rewrite the hash AT each other, and that is not a
// cosmetic redirect flicker. `useRoute` is a useSyncExternalStore over
// location.hash, so a navigate() inside a passive effect makes React's own
// store-instance check force a synchronous re-render, which runs the effect
// again — nested updates until React trips its limit with "Maximum update
// depth exceeded" and unmounts the shell. The app's error boundary sits above
// every route, so the whole product then reads "This view stopped working",
// including the address "Try again" returns to.
//
// The disagreement is reachable on a brand-new installation and nowhere else:
// the wizard row and the company profile are separate writes, and the connect
// act persists `step: "complete"` without requiring a saved profile. Both
// cases below are mounted through the REAL App, because a unit test of either
// half alone passes while the pair loops.
