// Copy, locale and capability — the app-level surface a unit screen needs to
// render honestly rather than merely to render.
//
// The capability hooks are surface rather than an internal detail on purpose:
// a screen that shows a control the caller may not use has told them something
// false, and the alternative to exporting these is every unit inventing its
// own read of /me. They are UX honesty and never enforcement — the server
// refuses independently (`extensionTool.Handle`), which is what makes it safe
// to hand a unit the same hooks the core screens use.
//
// `useT` reads the merged catalogue, so a unit's own copy resolves through the
// same lookup as core's rather than through a second mechanism.
import { type ExtensionMessageKey, useT as useCoreT } from "../i18n";

export { useCan, useCanWrite } from "../app/capability";
// `formatNumber` alongside `formatDateTime` for the same reason: a unit's screen
// renders figures a person reads, `useT` below refuses a raw number, and the
// only alternative left to a unit would be `String(n)` — which groups for
// nobody. A surface that narrows the parameter without exporting the formatter
// has told the unit to write the defect a different way.
export { formatDateTime, formatNumber } from "../format/format";
// LocaleProvider is here for the TESTS: a unit's screen calls useT, so a test
// that renders it without the provider the app mounts around it renders

// screen the way the app actually runs it.

/**
 * The catalogue lookup, widened to a unit's own keys.
 *
 * Core's `useT` is narrow — its key is a closed union, so a typo in a core key
 * is a compile error, and `ReturnType<typeof useT>` is the parameter type some
 * two dozen core helpers take a translator as. Widening it THERE would make
 * every core-only test fake stop being assignable, for a capability no core
 * helper has any use for. So the widening lives here, on the surface a unit
 * imports, which is the only place that needs it.
 *
 * A unit's half cannot be a closed union: this file cannot enumerate what an
 * installation enabled. The real rule is checked by the generator, which
 * refuses any key a unit ships that is not namespaced to that unit.
 *
 * The KEY is what widens here and nothing else. `params` stays strings, exactly
 * as core's does: a raw number reaching a catalog sentence is coerced without
 * grouping, which is wrong in a unit's screen for the same reason it is wrong
 * in a core one — and a cast that widened it here would put the hole back on
 * the one surface nothing in this repo typechecks against.
