// The design-system surface a unit screen may build from.
//
// A re-export file rather than a deep import into atoms.tsx, because this list
// IS the promise: what is named here a unit may use and the core may not break
// casually, and what is not named here is core-internal however exported it
// happens to be. It is this side's `//margince:extension-surface` — the Go
// tier gets its boundary from the compiler and a marker test, and a bundler
// gives none at all, so the surface has to be a declared thing before a gate
// can hold anyone to it.
//
// Widening it is a reviewed act. Adding a name here says the core will keep
// rendering it for units it did not write, which is a different promise from
// "this component exists".
// SegmentedControl, because a closed choice a reader must SEE all of is a
// different control from one they pick out of a list. Select already covers the
// long closed set; two or three mutually exclusive options rendered as a
// dropdown hide the very thing that makes them easy — that there are only three.
// A unit left with only Select either accepts that, or hand-rolls a row of
// buttons and gets the group semantics wrong: the fieldset, the accessible name
// carried onto each option, and the pressed state are the parts nobody rebuilds
// correctly by eye.
// DataTable, because a unit that has ROWS to show has otherwise to write a
// bare `<table>`, and no extension ships a stylesheet — so what it gets is the
// browser's default table, unaligned, unbounded, and scrolling the whole page
// sideways the moment it is wider than its column. This is the same argument
// FactList was published under, one dimension up: FactList draws one record's
// facts and there was no primitive at all for a LIST of them.
//
// DataTable rather than ListTable, and the difference is the promise. ListTable
// is a record list with server-backed query dials, saved views, a column picker
// and a keyset footer — a caller owes it sort state the server answers to.
// DataTable is columns, rows and a name, already inside the one `TableScroll`
// that keeps an over-wide table scrolling in its own box rather than taking the
// page with it. A unit's listing is the second shape, and publishing the first
// would promise a contract the core changes for its own record screens.

} from "../design-system/atoms";
// Callout, because a unit sometimes has to warn a person about a choice it is
// nonetheless going to let them make.
//
// The case that earned it: zalo-personal's capture card offers "everyone I talk
// to, except the people I leave out", which puts a rep's family, friends and
// doctor into the company CRM. That is a legitimate answer and it is warned
// about, not blocked — and a warning composed by a unit out of a Badge and a
// paragraph carries no ground, no border and none of the weight the same
// sentence has anywhere else in the product. A unit ships no stylesheet, so
// "make it look like a warning" is not something it can do for itself; the
// alternative to publishing this is a warning that reads as body copy.
//
// The tones are claims rather than decoration — see the component's own note —
// and that is exactly why this is publishable: a unit picking `warn` is saying
// the same thing core says with it.
export { Callout, type CalloutTone } from "../design-system/callout";
// ChoiceList, because a unit offering an either/or has otherwise to hide it in a
// dropdown: `Select` was the only closed-choice control published, and a menu
// covering two options makes a person open it to discover what the alternative
// was. A binary a rep has to weigh is the one choice that must be readable at
// rest, and no radio group existed to publish until this one.
export { type Choice, ChoiceList } from "../design-system/choicelist";
// FactList, because a unit screen has NO other way to draw a label→value pair.
//
// No extension ships a stylesheet — nothing in extensions/*/frontend imports
// CSS and the bundler gives a unit no place to put any — so a unit that writes
// its own `<dl>` gets the browser's 40px `dd` indent and no alignment at all.
// Publishing the pre-styled primitive is the only way a unit can present a
// record back, and a surface that offered every control for COLLECTING input
// and none for that is a surface whose screens look unfinished for a reason
// their authors cannot fix.
//
// It is the read-only half of what those screens need, which is why this is the
// primitive that gets published rather than FieldGrid: a unit describing what it
// connected is not editing it.
export { type Fact, FactList } from "../design-system/factlist";
// RecordPicker, because the alternative is every unit that touches a core
// record asking a person to paste a UUID.
//
// Picking a record is the one interaction a unit cannot avoid the moment it
// writes anything the product owns, and it is not a control anybody should
// rebuild: the debounce, a late answer ignored rather than rendered, the
// candidates dropped when the search space changes, and the selected state are
// four decisions each, and a unit getting one of them wrong is a screen that
// looks like the product and behaves like a prototype.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, because the difference costs a caller nothing to know
// and everything to assume:
//
//   - It ignores a stale answer; it does not ABORT the request. Rapid typing
//     still reaches the server, so a searchTargets that is expensive to answer
//     needs a bound of its own.
//   - Its failed-search line is the component's own English, from the caught
//     error. A unit that needs that line translated cannot supply it here yet
//     — the honest workaround is a searchTargets that resolves empty and says
//     so in the unit's own copy.
//   - It is a labelled field over a list of buttons, not a combobox: no
//     role=combobox, no aria-expanded, no arrow-key navigation.
//
// It carries NO transport of its own — the caller supplies searchTargets — so
// exporting it publishes a rendering promise and no data one. A unit reaches
// its candidates through the api surface, under the caller's own RBAC, exactly
// as a core screen does.
export {
  RecordPicker,
  type RecordPickerCandidate,
} from "../design-system/recordpicker";
// Select and its option type, because a unit offering a CLOSED choice has no
// other way to: design-system/native-controls.test.ts refuses a bare <select>
// in extensions/*/frontend exactly as it does in core, and a unit left with only
// TextInput has to accept free text where the contract declares an enum.
export { Select, type SelectOption } from "../design-system/select";
// TokenInput, because a unit collecting a LIST of short values has otherwise to
// ask for them comma-separated in a TextInput and split the string itself.
//
// What it publishes is not the box, it is the decisions inside it: one pasted
// line carrying several values and one keystroke carrying one commit through the
// same path, a value already spoken for skipped whether it collides with a token
// on screen or with an earlier part of the same paste, and a remove control that
// names the token it takes away. A unit that splits on commas gets none of those
// and looks like the product until somebody pastes.
// TokenList, because a set somebody assembled has to READ as a set.
//
// A unit that renders "name, then a remove button" per person produces a run of
// sentences — eight of them for eight people — and it cannot do better, because
// the chip ground, the gap and the placement of the X are all stylesheet, which
// a unit does not ship. This is the same token `TokenInput` draws, deliberately
// from the same file: one visual, one home.
