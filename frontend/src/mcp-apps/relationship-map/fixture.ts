 * One realistic `who_knows` answer, shaped exactly as the tool seals it.

 * MIRRORED BY HAND from agents.WhoKnowsAnswer / agents.KnownColleague — see the
 * account brief's fixture for why that is hand work rather than generated.
 *
 * The third colleague carries NO `strength`, which is the case this view exists
 * to keep honest: the seam omits it when the band is "none", because never
 * having spoken is not a score of zero.
