// WHY THE STATE AND THE DATE TOGETHER. "Overdue" is a claim about a moment,
// and the moment is in the answer — so the header names the instant every
// state below it was judged against. A queue of red labels with no date
// attached cannot be told from a stale panel left open since yesterday.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES TO INVENT. A promise with no due date renders as undated,
// never as overdue and never as "due today": the answer carries no timezone
// and neither does this document, so the only honest day is the one the server
// judged in. A promise with no owner renders as unowned, which is the state a
// reviewer is looking for rather than a blank to be filled in silently.
