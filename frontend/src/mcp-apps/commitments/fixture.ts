/**
 * One realistic `review_commitments` answer, shaped exactly as the tool seals
 * it.
 *
 * MIRRORED BY HAND from agents.ReviewCommitmentsResult / agents.CommitmentItem
 * — see the account brief's fixture for why that is hand work rather than
 * generated. It is HELD to that struct by
 * backend/gates/appviewfixtures_test.go, which compares every member here
 * against the tool's own output schema.
 *
 * The four items are the four states this view has to keep apart: badly
 * overdue, overdue by less than a day, upcoming, and a promise nobody dated.
 * The third one carries NO assignee, which is the state the panel exists to
 * surface — a promise with no owner.
