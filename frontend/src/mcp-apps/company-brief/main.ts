// The account brief view: read_brief's queue, with the factor decomposition
// each item ranked on.
//
// WHY THE FACTORS ARE THE POINT. The brief's own contract forbids the mystery
// number — an item that says only "this ranked first" restates the queue, while
// one that says "first on momentum and warmth" has told the contact something.
// The score alone would fit in the chat text this view renders instead of; the
// five factors beside it are what a table buys.
//
// It renders and nothing else: no control, no action, no call back into the
// surface. Acting on a brief item is a human-only route by contract, so a button
// here would be a door the contract does not have.
