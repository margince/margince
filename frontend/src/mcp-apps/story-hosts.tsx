//
// ONE FILE because it is one thing: Storybook-only scaffolding, never shipped
// UI. Keeping it together is also what lets the i18n copy rule exempt it by NAME
// rather than by a pattern — the developer-facing panel below is not copy a user
// ever reads, and the gate has no way to tell a story helper from a screen.

/**
 * The wrapper the renderer stories mount the REAL render() into. One wrapper for
 * both views, taking the renderer as a prop, because two copies of twelve lines
 * is two places for the mount to drift from what the document does.
 *
 * A CAVEAT THAT BELONGS IN THE FILE, not in a review comment: .storybook/
 * preview.tsx imports app.css, so these stories render against ambient Tailwind
 * and base element styles the standalone document does NOT have. A rule that
 * only works because app.css was loaded looks correct here and breaks inside a
 * host — the document stories beside these are what catch that.

/**
 * The wrapper the document stories put the REAL built bytes into, and then play
 * the protocol at.
 *
 * Three mechanics here are not stylistic, and each was a review finding:
 *
 *   `sandbox="allow-scripts"` with NO `allow-same-origin`. A bare srcdoc iframe
 *   inherits the embedding document's origin and is not opaque, so an
 *   unsandboxed story would not reproduce the real boundary at all — it would
 *   render a view with more privilege than any host ever grants it.
 *
 *   The story authenticates the child by RETAINING `contentWindow` and posts
 *   with `targetOrigin: "*"`. Under that sandbox the child's origin is the
 *   STRING "null", which is not a usable postMessage target, so the usual
 *   `event.source.postMessage(res, event.origin)` reply pattern fails here.
 *
 *   The built document is read through import.meta.glob rather than a static
 *   `import … from "…?raw"`. A static import of an absent file is a
 *   module-resolution error: Storybook would fail to BUILD, taking the CI
 *   frontend job down for unrelated changes — and it could never render the
 *   "run pnpm build" panel below. A glob that matches nothing is an empty
 *   object, which is what that panel exists for.
