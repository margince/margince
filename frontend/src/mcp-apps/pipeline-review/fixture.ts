/**
 * One realistic `whats_slipping_this_week` answer, shaped exactly as the tool
 * seals it.
 *
 * MIRRORED BY HAND from agents.WhatsSlippingResult / agents.SlippingDealItem —
 * see the account brief's fixture for why that is hand work rather than
 * generated. It is HELD to that struct by
 * backend/gates/appviewfixtures_test.go, which compares every member here
 * against the tool's own output schema.
 *
 * The third deal carries NO amount, which is a real state the view has to keep
 * honest: a deal can be worked before it is priced, and a blank amount
 * rendered as a currency zero would say it is worth nothing. The second one
 * carries two evidence lines, because a deal can be both quiet and late.
