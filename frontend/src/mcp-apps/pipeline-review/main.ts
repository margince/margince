// WHY THE EVIDENCE IS ON THE ROW AND NOT BEHIND A DISCLOSURE. The rank is a
// judgement, and the tool's whole contract is that a deal whose risk cannot be
// evidenced from its own fields is absent rather than guessed. A view that
// showed the ranking and hid the reasons would present that judgement as an
// oracle — which is the one reading the tool is written to prevent.
//
// It registers no tool of its own. `render_pipeline_review` is a document hung
// off a tool that already answers, which is what every `render_*` name on this
// surface is.
