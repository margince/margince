// work ready to hand over — and the answer is the list of what is missing. A
// brief that led with what it HAS reads as complete, which is exactly the
// failure the tool's gaps exist to prevent: an absent owner looks identical to
// a present one when nothing points at the absence.
//
// EVERY GAP SHOWS THE FIELD IT WAS READ OFF. The tool refuses to raise a gap
// it cannot point at a field for, and this document keeps that promise
// visible: a warning with no source beside it is advice, and neither the tool
// nor the view gives advice.
