/**
 * One realistic `prepare_handoff` answer, shaped exactly as the tool seals it.
 *
 * MIRRORED BY HAND from agents.PreparedHandoff — see the account brief's
 * fixture for why that is hand work rather than generated. It is HELD to that
 * struct by backend/gates/appviewfixtures_test.go, which compares every member
 * here against the tool's own output schema.
 *
 * It is a handover that is NOT ready, which is the case worth drawing: two
 * gaps, an untitled seat, an unpriced won deal beside a priced one, and a
 * promise already past due at handover. A complete one renders as the empty
 * state, and the stories carry that too.
