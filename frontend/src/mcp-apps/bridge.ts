// The App-side half of the MCP Apps postMessage transport (SEP-1865,
// 2026-01-26): a view is an MCP client that reaches its host through
// window.parent rather than through a socket.
//
// It is imported by EVERY view and folded into each built document, so the
// handshake exists once. A per-view copy would be two implementations of one
// protocol, and the failure they would eventually differ on is the one where a
// view renders nothing because it never announced itself.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO, and why each refusal is load-bearing:
//
//   It never builds DOM from a string. Everything a view displays arrives in
//   `structuredContent`, which is customer data — a person's name, a note
//   someone pasted, the subject line of an ingested email. That is untrusted
//   text by this system's own reckoning, and the view runs inside a sandbox
//   whose whole job is to contain it. Assigning that text as MARKUP would hand
//   it the one privilege the sandbox cannot take back: execution inside the
//   view's own origin. So text reaches the page only through textContent, and
//   structure only through createElement.
//
//   The markup-assignment properties are not named here, deliberately: the
//   admission check reads the built document, and prose that spelled one would
//   trip a check on the very thing it was explaining.
//
//   It holds no credential. A view is given a tool's ANSWER, never the means to
//   ask again. There is no token here to leak, which is a stronger property
//   than a token handled carefully.
//
//   It calls no tool. The protocol permits it; nothing here needs it, and it is
//   the widest part of the extension's surface. A view that stays a renderer
//   cannot become a second door onto a record.

 * money renders an amount the way the product renders one: integer MINOR units

 * JPY stores 1234 minor units and means ¥1,234; a view that divided by 100
 * everywhere would render ¥12.34 for it, and the same class of mistake in the
 * other direction is what made an account brief report every deal a hundred
 * times too large.
 *
 * This used to ask Intl for the digit count, on the stated grounds that it was
 * the rule format.ts applied. Both halves of that stopped being true: format.ts
 * takes the scale from minorunits now, and Intl was never the same table —
 * Intl follows CLDR, which records how a currency is USED, and the server
 * follows ISO, which records what the standard ASSIGNS. They disagree on ten
 * codes, so this view rendered a stored IQD 1234 as "IQD 1,234" where the
 * record means 1.234 dinars, and MGA and IRR a hundredfold out.
 *
 * Importing is safe where importing formatMoney was not: minorUnitDigits takes
 * NO locale — a currency's minor-unit count is a property of the currency —
 * so nothing of the translation machinery follows it into a document that is
 * inlined whole and served to a third-party host. That is the reason the scale
 * lives in its own module rather than inside the formatters.
 *
 * THE LOCALE IS THE HOST'S, DELIBERATELY, and this is the one rendering in the
 * product that does not take the reader's chosen one. What is missing is not
 * the MAPPING — importing `INTL_LOCALE` would cost almost nothing — it is the
 * locale to look it up with: this document is inlined whole into a page the
 * product does not own, with no LocaleProvider above it and no signed-in
 * reader's choice reaching inside it, so there is nothing to index the table
 * by. `undefined` is the honest remaining answer, and it is at least the locale
 * the reader's own browser reports. `format/one-locale.test.ts` carries this
 * file as a named exemption with this reason.
 *
 * An amount that is not a finite number, or a currency Intl does not know,
 * renders as the em dash. Intl throws on an unknown currency code, and a view
 * that threw mid-render would leave the reader a blank panel.
 *
 * SO DOES AN AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE SAFE INTEGER RANGE. The field is an int64 on
 * the wire and a double by the time this sees it, so a value past 2^53 has
 * already been rounded to a number that is not the one that was stored. There
 * is nothing to recover — the digits are gone before this function is called —
