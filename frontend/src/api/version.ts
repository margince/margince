// If-Match / row-version seam. Every PATCH / advance / merge / upsert sends the

// of silently overwriting.
//
// The version is required, and that is the point: a caller holding no version
// holds no claim about what it is overwriting, and the only two honest answers
// are to refuse the write or to read the row again. Neither of them is a header
// this function can invent, so there is no shape of this call that returns an
// empty precondition.
// The header spelled as the contract declares it, not as a bag of strings: an
// endpoint that REQUIRES the precondition takes no widened record, and the
// error belongs at the call site rather than one cast further in.

// a row reaches a write path typed as possibly unversioned even where the server
// always sends one. Unpinned is last-write-wins: the write lands on top of an
// edit it never saw and reports success to both editors. So the absence is a
// refusal, thrown where the write was about to happen — the mutation's own error
// path is what tells the reader the request did not go through.
