// The ONE API seam (architecture/01: the frontend depends on the generated
// contract, never Go internals). Types come from src/api/schema.d.ts —
// regenerate with `pnpm gen:api` after a crm.yaml change; never hand-edit.
//
// The specifier is the composition alias, not "./schema", and that is the whole
// of what makes an extension unit's screen able to use this client (ADR-0069).
// The VANILLA lane resolves it to src/api/schema.d.ts — the base contract — so
// `api.GET("/ext/notes")` is correctly a type error there: that
// installation does not serve the route. The COMPOSED lane
// (tsconfig.composed.json, `make fe-typecheck-composed`) resolves it to the
// types generated from the MERGED contract, where the route exists and is
// typed. One client, no wrapper, no cast, and the vanilla tree still refuses to
// compile a call it could not answer.
//
// It is a TYPE-ONLY import, so nothing changes at runtime and no bundler alias
// is needed: `verbatimModuleSyntax` erases the line entirely.
//
// One installation serves one organization (A107/ADR-0061): the server
// resolves its singleton organization itself — the client sends no tenant
// selector, only the session cookie.

// The reader's language, read from where the shell stores it. Sent on every
// request as Accept-Language so a server-side writer — the model-written
// briefs — answers in the language the reader is reading, rather than making
// them translate a summary they asked for. Storage can throw (private windows,
// blocked site data), and a client that cannot read a preference still has to
// make the call, so a failure is simply no header.
