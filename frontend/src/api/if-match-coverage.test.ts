// Fitness function for the lost update: a write to an endpoint that takes an
// `If-Match` precondition, sent without one.
//
// Two people move the same deal at the same moment. Both requests carry a stage
// and no precondition, both succeed, and the second silently replaces a change
// its author never saw — no conflict, no 409, no trace. The server offers the
// guard on every mutating endpoint that returns a versioned entity; omitting it
// is last-write-wins, and last-write-wins is not something a UI gets to choose
// by accident.
//
// The obligation is DERIVED, not listed: which endpoints take the precondition
// comes out of `schema.d.ts`, generated from the contract. Add a versioned
// endpoint upstream, call it from a screen, forget the header, and this fails —
// nobody has to remember to extend a list.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, deliberately: a call whose path is an expression
// rather than a literal (`api.POST(path, …)`, as the approvals inbox does to
// pick approve-vs-reject). Resolving those needs the type checker, and the inbox
// is also the one place a missing precondition is correct — the server re-admits
// the edited payload from scratch, and its endpoints declare no `If-Match` at
// all, so nothing here has an opinion about them.
