/**
 * The session route, in one spelling: `"GET /me": meRoute({ … })`.
 *
 * Every story that mounts a role-aware surface needs this line, and the reason
 * it is a helper rather than four lines copied per file is that the copies
 * drifted into omission — which is invisible, because a missing session looks
 * exactly like a denied one on screen.
 *
 * `allow` is the grants the story is ABOUT, and it has to be spelled out rather
 * than defaulted into: `meRoute({})` says the story means it.
 *
 * What `meRoute({})` is NOT is a denied seat. `meFixture` defaults to
 * `roles: ["admin"]` on a full seat, so an empty `allow` is an ADMIN holding no
 * object grants — `useHoldsAdminRole()` is true and `useCanMutate()` is true,
 * while every `useCan()` is false. That is a real principal and a useful one,
 * but a story about a denial has to say so with the second argument:
 * `meRoute({}, { roles: ["rep"], seat: "read" })`. Getting this wrong is
 * invisible on screen, which is how a story ends up named for a boundary it
 * never draws.
