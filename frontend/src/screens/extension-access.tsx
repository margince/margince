// Extension access (settings → Extensions): what the composed extension tier
// brought into this installation, and who may use it.
//
// The problem it exists to solve: a unit registers its own RBAC objects at
// composition time (ext_notes_note, ext_notes_signing_key, …), but nothing in
// the product could grant them — the only lever was hand-written SQL against
// role.permissions. So a shipped, enabled extension renders "you do not hold
// access" for every seat, and the screen that would explain why did not exist.
// This is that screen: the unit inventory, and one role × CRUD matrix per
// object the unit registered.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a general role editor. It shows the objects the
// extension tier contributed, because those are the ones no seeded role can
// possibly hold a grant on — every core object already comes granted by the
// bootstrap matrix.

// The wire shapes, read straight off the generated contract — this screen was
// written against hand-written copies while /roles and /extensions were landing
// in parallel, and they are gone now that the contract carries both. Everything
// below goes through the typed client, like every other screen.

// drift from the one the server accepts.

/**
 * One object's role × CRUD matrix.
 *
 * A real `<table>`, not a grid of divs: the two axes ARE the meaning here, and
 * a screen-reader user landing on a tick in the middle of it has to be able to
 * ask which role and which verb it belongs to. `scope="col"` / `scope="row"`
 * is what answers that, and `labelledBy` names which object the whole grid is
 * about — a table announced as "read create update delete" with no subject is
 * unreadable however many ticks it contains. The name is the row's own label
 * rather than a `<caption>`, because the stacked `SettingRow` already draws
 * that sentence directly above the grid and a caption would repeat it.
 *
 * Every cell is a `Switch`, not a `Checkbox`, and the difference is the whole
 * point of this grid: flipping one WRITES an RBAC grant. A checkbox states an
 * intent something later submits, so a reader who was told "checkbox" has been
 * told their next click is safe until they press Save — and there is no Save.
 * `role="switch"` is what says the click IS the change.
 *
 * Each carries its own full sentence as its accessible name ("Allow Rep to read
 * ext_notes_note"), because the header association alone is a hint, not a name:
 * a control has to be identifiable out of context, and it is the only thing a
 * user hears when tabbing straight to it. The name is `labelHidden`, so the
 * visible cell is the track alone.
 *
 * A seat that may not write gets the reason as the switch's own `reason`, which
 * `aria-describedby` attaches to the control — the block above states it once
 * for the eye, this states it to every reader who lands on a single cell.
