// What a staged proposal is, in words a reader recognises.
//
// `approval.kind` is a wire enum — `site_lead`, `fx_rate_proposal` — and it was
// rendered verbatim wherever a proposal was listed. A reader deciding whether
// to accept twenty-five of something needs to know what that something is, and
// snake_case in the German UI is not a translation of anything.
//
// The set is the approvals module's grant maps, and this map is pinned against
// them by backend/frontendapprovalkinds_test.go, which DERIVES the corpus
// rather than restating it. The gate this replaced compared against a list
// hand-copied into the frontend's own test, and a mirror of a mirror agrees
// with itself: eleven stageable kinds had no label and two labels named kinds
// the server had already dropped.
//
// What holds a kind to those maps is the compose-side census over every
// production staging site, not the staging writer itself — that one inserts
// the kind it is handed. So this map covers what the product stages, and the
// fallback below is what a kind reaching a reader some other way gets.
//
// A kind that still slips through falls back to its own words rather than its
// identifier: it must degrade to "site lead", never to a token that only makes
// sense to whoever wrote the server.

// The inline editor's default is every string field of the proposed_change,
// rendered as a text box. That default is right for a rename — the value IS
// prose — and wrong for a proposal built out of identifiers and enums. Editing
// `organization_id` re-aims the proposal at another record, and the server
// refuses that (assertSameEntityRefs); editing `proposed_lifecycle` by typing
// produces an invalid stage, and the server refuses that too. Both refusals
// are correct and neither is a thing to show a reader who was only trying to
// answer the question in front of them.
//
// So a kind may declare which fields it offers and what each one accepts. A
// kind that declares nothing keeps the default, which is why adding this
// changed no existing surface.
