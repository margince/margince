 * The beat between finishing setup and landing in the app.
 *
 * It exists so the workspace appears to be assembled rather than swapped in:
 * the product name rises out of a blur letter by letter, resolves into the real
 * wordmark, and the app's surfaces settle in behind it. The scene then dissolves
 * instead of cutting, and `onDone` fires and the caller navigates — this
 * component never routes.
 *
 * Two things keep a deliberate delay from becoming a trap:
 *  - it says what it is doing. A blocking full-screen scene that is silent to
 *    a screen reader is a dead end, so the whole thing is one `role="status"`
 *    named by the sentence it also prints.
 *  - under `prefers-reduced-motion` there is no scene at all. The end state of
 *    a decorative delay is *being past it*, so the callback fires immediately
 *    and nothing renders. Anything else makes the people who asked for less
 *    motion wait longest.
