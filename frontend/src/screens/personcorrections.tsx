/**
 * EnrichedFields is where the page stops asserting and starts asking.
 *
 * Every value here was read by a machine out of a page or a signature, and the
 * verbatim text it came from sits underneath it. What this adds is the other
 * half: the reader can say the machine got it wrong, and be believed next time.
 *
 * A corrected field shows the HUMAN's value with a marker, and the snippet the
 * machine read stays visible beneath it. Hiding the snippet would make the
 * correction unexplainable — what was misread is the reason the correction
 * exists.
 *
 * What the reader may SAY is a separate question from what they may see. The
 * evidence is a read and renders for anyone who can open the contact; recording
 * a verdict is a write, and `POST /ai/feedback` demands `update` on the subject
 * (ai/feedback.go, `auth.Require(subjectType, ActionUpdate)`), so the controls
 * are asked for once here and passed down rather than offered to every reader
 * and refused by the server.
