// Adding a document to the record the dialog was opened from — an account's
// document library, or a contact's.
//
// WHY THE PARENT IS A QUESTION AND NOT A DEFAULT. A document filed against the
// company is a document about the company; one filed against a deal is evidence
// in that deal, and it is the only kind the extraction panel will offer to read
// for deal fields, because a deal is the only record the accept can write to.
// Filing everything against the company would be the tidier form and would
// quietly make that feature unreachable, which is the state this screen was in
// before: the upload existed, hardcoded to the organization, and the reading it
// fed had no way to happen.
//
// WHY IT TAKES TWO REQUESTS. The upload endpoint carries the bytes and the
// parent and nothing else — category and title live behind
// `PATCH /attachments/{id}/metadata`. So the second call can fail on its own
// with the file already stored, and this dialog says exactly that rather than
// reporting a failure the reader would answer by uploading the same file twice.
//
// WHY THE QUESTION IS ONLY ASKED ON AN ACCOUNT. Deals hang off a company, so
// the account's library can offer its own deals as filing targets and a
// contact's cannot: nothing on a contact's page names a deal, and a contact is
// seated on deals at companies they may not even work for. The contact's
// library therefore files against the contact, with no choice to make, rather
// than growing a control whose one option is the record you are already on.
