// The pure derivations live here (unit-tested); the hook wires them to the

 * The write-body slice as a DIFF against the record the form opened on.

 * being stated for the first time. On an UPDATE it is not: an empty field
 * coerces to `null`, the API reads a top-level null as *forget this column*
 * (httperr.ClearedFields), and no `cf_*` column is clearable — so a full
 * snapshot refused every save of any record with an empty custom field, naming
 * a field the person had not touched. That is the same defect the core fields
 * had, in the other half of the same body.
 *
 * Compared on the FORM's own strings, the way the core diff is: a control left
 * alone holds exactly what it was seeded with, and the stored shape (minor
 * units, a boolean, a trimmed string) is derived from that string afterwards.
 *
 * A blank over a stored value is still a change and still travels as null. The
 * API refuses that today — no catalog column is clearable — which is a real gap
 * and a different one: it is about what the custom-field contract can express,
 * not about a form sending fields nobody edited.
