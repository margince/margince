// the unit BROUGHT (its objects, routes and jobs) reads last, behind a closed
// disclosure: it is reference an operator opens to check which object gates the

// The matrix at 390px, where it is the widest thing in settings that is not a
// table of figures: a role column plus four CRUD columns, with both header rows
// and the role names deliberately nowrap. It is meant to scroll inside
// `.ext-matrix-wrap` rather than push the page sideways (the no-horizontal-page-
// scroll rule), and the scroller holds the checkboxes themselves so it stays
// keyboard-reachable. This is the width at which the stacked row's
// `.settingrow-measure` wrapper earns its place: without the `min-width: 0` it
// carries, the grid grows to its own width inside a flex control column and the
// PAGE scrolls instead of the table. Above it, the version Badge and the link to
// the unit's own page share the panel head with the unit name and are supposed
// to wrap onto their own row.
//
// Storybook applies the viewport from the MANAGER, by resizing the preview
// iframe — so the fe-uat capture, which loads a bare iframe.html, renders this at
