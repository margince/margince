// distinct states, not one: `unsupported_by_sor` is a WRITE the mirror
// cannot serve (mutating a mirrored record — create/log-activity/advance/
// merge/promote/disqualify); `unsupported_in_overlay_mode` is a READ whose
// list/sort/filter dial the mirror does not hold (compose/overlayread.go's
// unsupportedOverlayParam — e.g. tasks' `kind` filter). Collapsing both onto
// one "can't serve this write" string would be false for the read case, so a
// caller holding a translator gets copy naming which kind of refusal
// happened. Callers without a translator — and every other problem code —
// keep the server's own detail verbatim, exactly as before.
//
// A refusal is the OPPOSITE case: `permission_denied` is one code over two
// authorities — an object-RBAC denial (this role does not admit the action on
// this kind of record) and a row-authority denial (the record is on screen
// through a read share) — and nothing on the wire says which of the two
// happened. So the catalog copy replaces the server's detail and deliberately
// does not guess: copy that named the wrong authority would be worse than the
// bare sentinel.
//
// Replacing it loses nothing a reader wanted, and that is the part worth
// knowing before anyone tries to "keep the more specific answer". `httperr`
// builds a refusal's detail from `err.Error()`, and every producer of this
// sentinel wraps it with INTERNALS: `auth.Require` sends the RBAC object and
// verb ("person.update: permission denied"), the admission gate sends its own
// spec name and resolver state. None of that is copy, and showing it would
// leak the shape of the authority model to a client. There is no path on which
// the server sends a sentence written for a reader here.
//
// `seat_tier_insufficient` is the LICENSING ceiling, and it is a different
// refusal from the two above: it is decided before any role is consulted, so a
// reader whose role admits the action is refused anyway. Its server detail is
// the bare sentinel ("seat tier insufficient"), which names a concept no
// reader has met and offers nothing to do about it, so the catalog copy
// replaces it and points at the one person who can lift the ceiling. It names
// the SEAT rather than "your seat": the same code answers a read seat's own
// mutation, an agent passport acting for one, and a grant that would give a
// read seat write access. A surface that knows WHOSE seat it is (share.tsx

// to. A body that DOES carry text always keeps it — the server's own words
// can never be replaced from here.

// so no screen has to remember this and none can lose it; and because
// react-query runs a mutation to completion independently of whichever
