//
// TWO names, and which one belongs where is the whole rule: the surface a reader
// meets is **Decisions** — that is the panel title, and every `decision.*` copy
// key — and the thing on the wire is an **approval**, which is what `crm.yaml`
// calls it and therefore what this file, its hooks and its types are named for.
// Nothing is called an inbox, a drafts queue or a staged list: those were three
// more names for one surface, and a reader who is told four names for one thing
// has been told none. This file was `inbox.queries.ts` and was the last of them
// in the tree.
//
// The Decided view is an Option-1 client-side partition:
// the listApprovals contract only accepts status ∈ {pending, approved,
// rejected} (crm.yaml enum), and the server computes expiry LAZILY at read
// time (approvals/inbox.go effectiveStatus) — a pending row past its expiry
// is STORED status=pending but WIRED back as status="expired". So there is no
// status=expired query; expired items ride in on the status=pending response
// and are re-partitioned here. The merged hooks return a plain QueryLike (the
// narrow surface QueryGate reads) — no `as unknown as UseQueryResult` lie.

// walks every page via the API's opaque `next_cursor` and merges them into
