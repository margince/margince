// workspace-readable the way a sent activity is — so there is no owner column
// here and no sharing affordance, and none of these stories is about a role.

// only one waiting on a person, `scheduled` as the queue proper, and everything
// settled below them. A rep with nothing scheduled reads ONE sentence rather
// than three empty blocks, which is `NothingScheduled`.
