 * Bulk verbs over selected deals: assign an owner, move to a stage, archive.

 * bulk endpoint, and inventing one would bypass the per-row version guard.
 * Each row sends ITS OWN If-Match from the version the list holds; one version
 * copied across the selection would conflict on every row but the one it came
 * from. A row that moved under the reader answers 409, is reported by name,
 * and can be retried once the list has refetched.
 *
 * Only OPEN stages are offered. Closing a deal asks for a lost reason and
 * freezes an exchange rate, and doing that to a dozen deals behind one button
 * — with one reason standing for all of them — is not a thing this bar should
 * make easy.
