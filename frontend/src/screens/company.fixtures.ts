// What the server answers a company record with, in ONE place.
//
// Mounting `CompanyScreen` fires the same five reads on every render — the
// composite 360, the hierarchy roll-up, the deterministic brief, the
// relationship strength, the assistant's context — before a suite can assert
// anything about the one card or tab it is actually about. A suite that carries
// its own copy of those answers is making a second claim about the same wire,
// free to drift from this one, and the next read the screen grows reaches only
// the copy whose file the author happened to have open.
//
// This module answers the WIRE and nothing else: response bodies for real
// endpoints, and the stub that routes a request to one. It never stands in for
// what the screen does with them — a fixture that reimplemented the page's own
// logic would prove the fixture right rather than the page. Mounting is the
// suite's own business, and keeping it out is what lets this file stay JSX-free:
// `scripts/fe-uat.mjs` reads every `.tsx` under `src/` as a component and asks
// for a story that renders it, which a set of response bodies cannot have.
