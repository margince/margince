 * TagsSection carries two independently-governed halves: the lists this
 * account belongs to, and the tags applied to it. Each states its own
 * withheld/empty/ready rather than one verdict speaking for both.
 *
 * The add-tag / add-to-list verbs live HERE, one under each half, rather
 * than in a separate strip elsewhere on the page (CompanyFilingActions,
 * organizations.tsx — retired once this landed): reading and writing the
 * same fact from two different columns is the confusion this section exists
 * to close. Each verb keeps the gate the old strip enforced — rendered only
 * once its OWN half has answered (ready or empty) — so a caller who cannot
 * read tags is never offered a button to add one, and a half that failed to
 * load cannot say whether the write makes sense.
