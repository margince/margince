// The live half of the overlay card takes its two reads as QueryLike props and
// its two grants as booleans, so it needs no network and no query client — it
// is exercised directly against hand-built fixtures rather than through the
// whole OverlayCard, the same seam overlay-health.stories.tsx uses. What is
// under test here is its honesty about WHY the action row is missing: this
// surface renders only on an installation already in overlay mode, so a seat
// without the grants is looking at a live mirror it cannot steer.
//
// The readings and the verbs are two components because the card hands them to
// two different slots of one Panel — the recessed plate and the action band —
// so they are rendered together here, exactly as OverlayCard composes them.

// A settled QueryLike. Written out rather than borrowed from a react-query
// result: this component only ever reads these five fields, and a hand-rolled
// UseQueryResult would assert far more shape than the seam promises.
