// The Reports screen for the fe-uat render gate. All three report segments draw
// into ONE surface — a titled card whose trailing action row carries "Explain
// this number" — so each story below is that same card holding a different
// report, which is exactly the drift these stories exist to catch: the screen
// body had no render coverage while three segments grew three different looks.
//
// Every read is stubbed off the same shapes reports.test.tsx exercises; the
// segment stories click the picker in play() because the screen owns the
// selection, and fe-uat waits for the interaction to settle before capturing.
