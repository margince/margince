// The extension-access card renders the composed unit inventory and one
// role × CRUD matrix per registered object, and drives the grant seam. The
// server stays the RBAC authority — this suite asserts the wire calls and the
// states an operator reads, not the gate itself.
//
// The transport is stubbed at `fetch`, but the SHAPES below are now the ones
// crm.yaml defines — /v1/roles and /v1/extensions have landed, and the fixtures
// were re-checked against the generated types. Two fields spelled `version`
// mean different things and are typed differently, which is the trap this
// fixture set exists to hold still: `ComposedExtension.version` is the unit's
// display string ("0.3.1"), while `Role.version` is an int64 RowVersion — the
// one that rides out as `If-Match`, and therefore the one a test asserts as the
// STRING the header carries.

// The SPA's generated registry, stubbed at the alias rather than at
// app/extensions: the lookup under test IS findExtension, and the vanilla
// registry this suite compiles against is empty by construction, so the "unit
// has a page" case can only be reached by handing the registry the shape the
// generator emits.
//
// Three units, and the three cases are deliberately different. `notes` has a
// descriptor and operations, so it has a page. `quiet` has a descriptor and NO
// operations — the jurisdiction-pack shape, whose generic page would draw a
// heading over an empty list. `stale` is absent from the registry entirely,
// which is the version skew the card has to name rather than swallow.
