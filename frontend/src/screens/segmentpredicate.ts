// The filter tree a human edits, and the one the server stores.
//
// These are the SAME shape on purpose. A node is a group (`and`/`or` over
// children) or a leaf (`field`/`op`/`value`), which is exactly
// storekit.Predicate — so encoding is near-identity rather than a translation.
// A translation layer would be a second spelling of the predicate the engine
// already owns, and the whole point of that engine is that there is one: what a
// filter may say, what it selects, and what an export of it contains cannot
// differ.
//
// The one thing the editor needs that the wire must never carry is stable
// identity. React needs a key, and "remove THIS clause" needs to name a node
// that may be structurally identical to its sibling. So every node carries an
// `id` here, and `encode` strips it — both halves live in this file so a caller
// cannot do one without the other.
//
// No React in this module. The tree is where the real logic is (nesting,
// immutable update, encoding), and it should be provable without rendering
// anything.

 * with nothing in that field — so this asks about the operand's TYPE, never its
