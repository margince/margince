// when `hostSlug` is set, and the session-authed page (#/book) when it is not.
// Both are here, because both are what the component draws.

// The public page's invariant is that a confirmation is never fabricated: a slot
// is only submittable once the visitor has given a name, an email AND consent,
// and the wording shown at the checkbox is byte-for-byte the wording submitted.
// So the resting public story shows slots that are deliberately not yet
// clickable, and the confirmed story earns the click through play().
