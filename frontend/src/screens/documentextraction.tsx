// What a document says, staged for a human to accept onto the deal.

// The panel reads one attached file for four deal facts — its name, its amount,
// its currency, its close date — and offers each one with the text it was read
// from. Nothing here writes anything: accepting is what writes, and accepting is
// a human's click.
//
// THREE STATES, AND THEY MUST NOT COLLAPSE INTO EACH OTHER. A reading that has
// not answered yet, a reading that answered and could ground nothing, and a
// reading that could not read the file at all are three different things to a
// rep, and only the middle one means "this document does not say". Rendering the
// last two the same way is how a rep learns to distrust a correct empty answer —
// or, worse, trusts a broken one.
//
// WHAT THE PANEL WILL NOT DO. It does not offer a value the reading omitted,
// however plausible: a field below the confidence floor is reported as omitted
// with its reason, not shown greyed out with a number in it. And it does not
// re-read the document to check itself before accepting — it sends the id of the
// reading it is showing, so what lands on the deal is the value on this screen.
