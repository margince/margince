/**
 * The gate that stops this bundle rendering against an api from another release.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS AND WHY. Ahead of every other gate in App, including the session
 * boundary and the public screens. A mixed-release set breaks the login request
 * itself — the SPA calls a contract the api has never served — so a guard behind
 * authentication would only ever run on installations that were already fine.
 * The capability probe is anonymous precisely so this can be asked before anyone
 * is signed in.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT LATCH. The skew is recomputed from the probe on every render, so a
 * rolling deploy that momentarily serves one release from one api replica and
 * another from the next clears itself as soon as the fleet converges — no state
 * to reset, no stuck screen. What it will NOT clear on its own is a torn tag
 * pull, because nothing about a torn pull resolves itself; that is what the
 * message asks a human to fix.

 * Reload is offered because it is genuinely the fix for the common case: a tab
