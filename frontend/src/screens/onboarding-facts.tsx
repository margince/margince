 * it. Callers surface `atCap` as `ob.facts.capReached` — a refusal that says why
 * beats a selection silently truncated on the way to the server.
 *
 * Additions append, so the persisted array keeps its order across a re-render
 * and a keys-only diff stays a keys-only diff. Keys already in the list that no
 * longer match a fact in `facts` are left alone: they belong to the wizard
 * state, not to this render.
