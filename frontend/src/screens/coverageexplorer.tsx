// Comparing a chosen few colleagues against the account's contacts.
//
// The compact coverage on each contact row answers "who should make this call".
// This answers the other question — "where are we thin" — and it is the one that
// tempts a contact × every-colleague matrix. With a forty-person sales team that
// matrix is 40 columns wide and nobody reads it.
//
// So the reader CHOOSES the colleagues to compare, up to a handful, and the grid
// is that selection wide. Which is also the honest shape: comparing everyone is
// not a question anybody has, and a grid that answers it is a grid that answers
// nothing.
//
// Two things it will not do. It never shows message content — the cell says the
// band and the reader opens the contact for the rest, so the grid cannot become
// a way to read a colleague's mail. And a grid built from an incomplete graph
// says so, because "no connection" and "the read was capped before it got here"
// are different claims and only one of them means nobody has tried.

// The two fields this surface actually reads, rather than a whole 360 contact.
//
// Narrowed because the caller changed: the roster card this used to sit inside
// is gone, and the account's contact list feeds it now. Naming the fields makes
// both shapes fit and stops a future field on the 360 card reading as a
// dependency this comparison does not have.
