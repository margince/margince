// The card where the page stops asserting and starts asking. Three things it
// owes the reader, none of which the surface enforced:
//
//   - a control is offered only to somebody the server will admit. `POST
//     /ai/feedback` demands `update` on the subject, so a read seat pressing
//     "That is right" was promised a verdict and handed a 403.
//   - a control is offered only where it can still apply. A claim a human has
//     already corrected has been settled by the only party who settles it.
//   - what the editor opens on is what the field says NOW. Text a reader
//     abandoned must not come back on the next open and be saved over the
//     value they kept.
