// Money on this page is an integer minor amount PLUS its ISO currency, and the
// wire may carry either half alone. Neither absence has a safe default, and the
// two failures are not symmetric:
//
//   - a missing amount rendered as 0 states a figure the server never sent, and
//     "€0 won" reads as a settled account rather than as an unknown one;
//   - a missing currency has no rendering at all — Intl.NumberFormat throws a
//     RangeError on an empty currency code, so a page that reaches for one takes
//     the whole record down, navigation rail included.
//
// Both readings therefore go through formatMoneyOrAbsent, and both suites below
// mount the panels directly: the account page renders them from a composite read
// whose deals section a stub would have to fake anyway.
