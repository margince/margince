/**
 * DetailsGrid draws the account's own fields as a label/value grid: legal
 * name, where it stands with us, who owns it, its domain, its address (one
 * row per part), industry, size, LinkedIn page and description. EVERY known
 * field draws a row, whether or not the account carries a value: an absent
 * field is a fact about the record (nobody has filled it in yet), and hiding
 * the row along with the fact erases the "yet" — a reader can only add what
 * they can see is missing. An empty row reads as a quiet add affordance
 * (InlineText/InlineChoice's own empty-state button) rather than a blank
 * line.
 *
 * Writability gates the VERBS only, never the values: an archived or
 * overlay-mirrored account still shows every field, it simply shows them
 * without the edit affordance (InlineText/InlineChoice's own
 * `canEdit={false}` path). Derived internally from `useCan("organization",
 * "update")` and `useCompanyReadOnlyReason` — the same RBAC grant and the
 * same archived/overlay reasoning the header's own inline controls already
 * gate on — rather than threaded down as a prop, so a caller cannot render
 * this grid writable on a record it should not be able to write.
 *
 * Every field here edits in place, including lifecycle, domain and address —
 * none of the three is scalar the way legal name or industry is, so each
 * keeps its own rule about what "editing this" is allowed to touch:
 *
 *   - Lifecycle and owner both reuse the header's OWN control
 *     (`CompanyLifecycleControl` / `CompanyOwnerControl`) rather than a
 *     second InlineChoice PATCHing the same field down its own path — one
 *     implementation of "how this field is written," mounted here and in
 *     the header, so the two can never disagree about what they last wrote.
 *   - Domain edits the PRIMARY domain's name only, and always sends the
 *     record's full domain array back with that one entry changed: `domains`
 *     is a replace-set on the wire (interfaces.md), so a write that sent
 *     just the edited entry would silently drop every other domain the
 *     account has. Clearing the field to empty is refused client-side
 *     (`field.domainRequired`) rather than sent as a delete — removing a
 *     domain outright stays in the full editor, which can retarget which
 *     domain is primary and prompts for confirmation.
 *   - Address is six rows, one per part (line 1, line 2, city, region,
 *     postal code, country) rather than one grouped editor: each part reuses
 *     InlineText exactly as it stands, with zero new commit machinery, at
 *     the cost of a longer grid than a single "Address" row would be. Every
 *     write sends the WHOLE address object back with only that one part
 *     changed (`{...current, [part]: next}`) — `address` replaces the
 *     object wholesale on the wire, so omitting the untouched parts would
 *     blank them.
 *
 * ABSENT VS WITHHELD, stated rather than built: this grid does not today
 * distinguish a field nobody has filled in from one the viewer's role cannot
 * see, because `Organization` carries no field-level grant signal to draw
 * that distinction from — only `computed_fields` does (STATE-4), and it is
 * not one of these fields. `FieldGuard` (design-system/rbac.tsx) is the
 * presentation primitive for a withheld value once one exists; its own
 * comment names B-EP03.4 as the wire change this grid is waiting on. Until
 * then every empty row here reads as absent, which is the only fact this
 * grid can currently tell.
