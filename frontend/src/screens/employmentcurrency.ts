// WHICH employer represents somebody and is written once; whether that job is
// still theirs is a function of today, so every reader derives it — on this side
// too, or the 360 header names a company the account's own contact count has
// already stopped counting them at.
//
// Its own module because three screens read it: the rail's current marker and
// its "add company" default, and the 360's employer line and former-employer
// list. Two copies of a date rule is one more than the number that can be right.

// today is the reader's OWN day, and it is also what the rail SENDS as `ended_at`
// when somebody ends an employment — one spelling, so the date written and the
// date compared against cannot be a day apart.
//
// Built from the local components rather than by `toLocaleDateString("en-CA")`.
// That happens to yield ISO on the engines we ship against and is not promised
// to: the value is compared LEXICOGRAPHICALLY here and sent as a `date` to the
// server, so a locale that formatted it any other way would silently answer a
// different question and write a malformed field.
// `toISOString` would be UTC, which is a different day from the reader's for
// part of every day and a different day again from the database's.
//
// A client-supplied day can still differ from the database's for somebody far
// from the deployment; nothing here can close that, and the flag is only ever
// used for DISPLAY on this side — the server decides what it stores.
