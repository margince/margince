 * Grouping the account's chronology into the events a reader recognises.
 *
 * A company timeline rendered one row per message shows the same exchange
 * several times: a product update sent to three contacts is three rows, and a
 * five-message thread is five. The reader is left reconstructing conversations
 * from fragments, which is the job the page exists to do for them.
 *
 * Two groupings, and no more:
 *
 *  - a THREAD is the provider's own conversation id. Not a subject match —
 *    grouping by subject merges two unrelated "Re: Update" exchanges and splits
 *    one that was renamed mid-conversation.
 *  - a BULK SEND is one message the sender addressed to several contacts at once.
 *    It has no thread of its own, so it is recognised by shape: same subject,
 *    same day, and either the sender's own List-Unsubscribe attestation or
 *    enough copies that no other reading is plausible.
 *
 * Everything else stays a single row. A grouping that guessed would hide a
 * message inside a summary nobody opened, which is worse than the repetition
 * it replaced.
