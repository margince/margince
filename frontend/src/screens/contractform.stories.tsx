// Recording an agreement, and reaching the paper already filed against it.
//
// THE FIVE STATES OF THE SIGNED-DOCUMENT FIELD ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE.
// A field that renders a bare drop zone says "there is no paper on file", and
// that sentence is only true in one of them. It shipped wrong once: an empty
// list stood in for a read that was still running, one that failed, and one a
// grant refused, so the field confidently reported an absence it had no way to
// know about. The fifth is the same failure pointed the other way: the endpoint
// paginates, and a page drawn as a list claims a completeness nobody checked.
// Each story below is one of those states, because that is the difference a
// screenshot can show and a passing test cannot.
