// Exporting what the filter selects (AC-filters-and-views-8).
//
// `/exports` takes the same predicate the preview does, so this sends the tree
// the reader is looking at rather than a saved view's id: what you export is
// what the count above it says, through the one filter engine. Nothing here
// re-derives a slice.
//
// Two things this file does NOT do, both deliberately. It does not page the
// export — the server renders the whole matching slice, and a client-side
// stitch of preview pages would be a second, wrong answer to the same question.
// And it does not ask the reader to confirm: clicking "Export CSV" IS the
// confirmation, and the server writes the audit row that makes the export
// accountable (P7/P12).
