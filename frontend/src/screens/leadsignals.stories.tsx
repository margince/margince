//
// The shape before this asked for Factor / Value / Evidence quality /
// Confidence / Why as five equal fields, and opened by asking a rep to grade
// their own evidence — which is a form a rep abandons. The provenance did not
// leave the wire; it stopped being the first thing asked.
//
// Both halves are stories here on purpose. `Collapsed` is what a rep meets, and
// `ProvenanceOpen` is the state a reviewer has to be able to see, because what
// the disclosure hides is what the unopened form SENDS.
