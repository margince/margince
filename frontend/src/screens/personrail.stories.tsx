// The person rail, and specifically the states a permission produces — which
// the live stack cannot show at all: every seeded demo contact carries full
// RBAC, so `sections_omitted` is always empty there and a withheld reading
// never draws.
//
// The PAIR is the whole gallery. A rail whose relationship sections were
// withheld and a rail belonging to a contact nobody has ever written to must
// not look alike: the first is a fact about the reader's grants, the second a
// fact about the relationship, and the rail's four short verdicts —
// "One-sided", "Never", "No inbound", "Thin" — belong to the second only. Read
// the two stories side by side; if they read the same, the rail is lying to
// somebody.
//
// Check both themes. The Overall reading is the only one drawn in the verdict
// colour, and a withheld reading has to lose that colour in dark as well as in
// light — every tone here is a `color-mix()` of a token and the dark palette
// lifts the accents, so the one surface that must NOT look like a verdict is
// the one worth re-checking after the theme switch.
