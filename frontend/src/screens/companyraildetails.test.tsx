// The address is six rows of one fact, and a crawled record fills none of them:
// a team page names no registered address. Drawn inline, the panel opened with
// six consecutive invitations to type and pushed the account's actual facts
// below the fold — so the parts sit behind a disclosure that is closed exactly
// when there is nothing in them.
//
// Both cases assert on the browser's own state (`details.open`, and jest-dom's
// `toBeVisible`, which is the one matcher that knows a closed `<details>` hides
// its content): the six labels stay in the DOM either way, and dom-testing-
// library's role queries return them whether the disclosure is open or shut, so
// an absence assertion phrased as a missing node would pass on markup that
// shows the reader all six.
