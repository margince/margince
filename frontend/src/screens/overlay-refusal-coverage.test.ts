// Fitness function for the overlay-mode refusal set (backend/internal/
// compose/overlaywrite.go's overlayRecordWriteTools + overlayread.go's
// unsupportedOverlayParam): a SPA call site that can receive
// `unsupported_by_sor` (a refused WRITE) or `unsupported_in_overlay_mode`
// (a refused READ dial) from one of these ops must hand problemMessage/
// throwProblem a translator, or the caller falls back to the server's terse
// sentinel text instead of the copy in screens/common.tsx naming which kind
// of refusal happened. Most of these ops are also hidden client-side behind
// `!overlay` (create.tsx, merge.tsx, DealBadges, …), so the untranslated
// fallback is latent, not a live user-facing bug — but it fires the moment
// a workspace's overlay mode flips mid-session and a stale ["me"] cache
// still shows the affordance. This test does not discover a NEW refused
// call site by itself: it pins the swept set below, so an edit that drops
// the `t` argument from one of these lines fails loudly here instead of
// only in a stale-cache bug report. The swept set (11 ops per
// overlaywrite.go, minus DELETE /activities/{id}, which no SPA screen
// calls):
//   create person/org/deal/lead, log-activity (POST /activities from
//   logactivity.tsx), advance-deal (both its board and reopen callers),
//   merge-person, merge-org, promote-lead, disqualify-lead.
