// They live apart from the page that draws them because three other surfaces
// send a reader to a tab — the header's verbs and the rail's "view all" — and
// `navigate` takes `id2` as a bare string. When the tab set last changed, two
// of those call sites kept pointing at ids that no longer existed: the router
// fell back to Overview and nothing anywhere said so. `personTabRoute` is
// typed on `PersonTab`, so the next rename fails to compile instead.

/**
 * The seven tabs, in the concept's order (§5.4). URL-addressable, so a tab
 * survives a reload and can be linked to.
 *
 * Activity and History are ONE tab, as they are on the account page: what was
 * said to a contact and what was changed about them are one chronology to the
 * person reading them, and the filter above the list is what separates them.
 *
 * Network sits next to Timeline because the two answer neighbouring questions:
 * the timeline is what passed between us and this contact, the network is who
 * else that reaches. It is a tab rather than an overview card because its
 * answer is a working surface — a reader interrogates the routes and the
 * seats — and the overview stack is a glance.
