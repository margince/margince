// The Filters & views screen (AC-filters-and-views-1/3/4): the surface a
// human authors a dynamic filter on, which until now existed only through the API.
//
// It hosts three things and owns none of them. The object control picks which
// record type's vocabulary to read; the builder draws the tree; the count comes
// back from the preview. What this file adds is the wiring and one judgement — how
// to report a count that is one edit behind, which is the honest state of any live
// recount over a moving table.
