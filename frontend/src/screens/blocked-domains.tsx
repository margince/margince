// The domains this installation refuses a company (ADR-0072). A vendor the

// a crawl can gather says "company" — only a standing decision says otherwise,
// which is why the refusal lives on the domain rather than on any sender or
// read.
//
// The card exists for one question an operator cannot otherwise answer: a
// company that never appeared — was it refused, and by whom? So `source` is a
// first-class column, not a detail: a bulk-sender verdict and somebody's
// deliberate call look identical in the outcome and are completely different
// facts. Every human role reads the list (`organization:read`); changing an
// entry demands `organization:update`, so the verb is refused rather than
// hidden, like the capture cards beside it.
//
// The write is a PUT that is idempotent on the normalized domain: there is no
// version to quote and none to send, so no `ifMatch` here — an entry for a
// domain already on the list REPLACES it, which is also how a refusal is undone.

// The row shape comes from the generated contract rather than being restated
// here: a hand-written copy would drift the first time the contract gains a
// field, and drift silently, since nothing compares the two.
