// state, and a load failure — all off the same GET /connectors shape the
// unit tests (connectors.test.tsx) already exercise.
//
// Every story renders TWO panels now — mail capture and the workspace's
// Telegram bot — because the component draws both, and both are built from the
// same SettingRow: identity and health on the left, state and verbs on the
// right, at one x. What to check in any of these pictures is that the right
// column really does line up down the whole pair, including across the
// history-import block that rides under a connected mailbox's row.
//
// Both panels also put their description in the BODY rather than in `Panel`'s
// `sub`, which is what keeps the two header bands the same height: a sentence in
// the band raises it, and one card taller than its neighbour is a page that has
// lost its beat.
