 * however large it is set. Two details keep it honest:
 *
 *  - the GHOST is an invisible copy of the full sentence holding the final height
 *    open, so the scope line and the limits below never move. A typewriter that
 *    reflows the column under itself is worse than none.
 *  - the sentence reaches assistive tech COMPLETE, through an `.sr-only` span,
 *    because a screen reader must not be fed a partial sentence character by
 *    character. It is a span rather than an `aria-label` on the <p> because a
 *    paragraph has no role that supports being named — biome's a11y lint says so
 *    too.

 * Under reduced motion (or on a hidden tab) `useTypeStream` returns the complete
