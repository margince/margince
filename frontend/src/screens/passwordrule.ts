 * The password rule the client states, in one place.

 * It was in three: `passwordcard.tsx`, `setupclaim.tsx` and `auth.tsx` each
 * declared `MIN_PASSWORD = 12`, each commented as "the floor the server applies,
 * restated". Three copies of a number the server owns is a lesser problem than
 * what sat under them — the three did not agree on what a character IS.
 * `auth.tsx` measured `password.length`, which counts UTF-16 code units, while
 * the other two measured `[...password].length`, which counts code points. A
 * password carrying an emoji or any astral character therefore passed on the
 * reset screen and was refused on the change screen, or the reverse, depending
 * on which side of twelve it landed. The server has one rule; the client had
 * two, and neither screen could see the other.
 *
 * Code points is the reading kept, because it is what a contact means by "twelve
 * characters" — a single emoji is one character to the reader who typed it, and
 * counting it as two lets a password that LOOKS eleven characters long pass.
