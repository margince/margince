 * whether the relationship is healthy or what deals are open with them. What
 * the lifecycle changes is the fifth reading: a prospect is asked when the deal
 * lands, a customer what the money says.
 *
 * The standing readings come first, the money readings after: what is true of
 * the account regardless of what it has paid is the frame the money sits in,

 * none. A slot that vanishes leaves the reader unable to tell WHICH reading is
 * missing — the row simply looks shorter — and only an empty state is allowed to
 * claim there is none (SurfaceState's rule). So the three absences are three
 * different words and never one: withheld is a fact about the READER, unassessed
 * is a fact about how much has been judged, and "no date" is a fact about the
