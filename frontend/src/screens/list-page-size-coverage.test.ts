// Fitness function for the ONE page size.
//
// `ListQuery.perPage` is the size the reader picks in the table footer, and
// every fetcher's `limit` is derived from it through `listFetchLimit` — a whole
// number of rendered pages per read. A screen that keeps a literal limit
// instead renders a page size the server never returned: the footer offers 100,
// the response holds 50, and the count line says "1-50 of 100 loaded so far" —
// the exact reading that made the company list look like a broken pager.
//
// A limit that is `query.perPage` itself is the same defect in the other
// direction: one page per read is what leaves the pager unable to offer a
// second number until the reader has already asked for it.
//
// Four screens (leads, partners, products, offer templates) carried that
// mismatch for a whole release after the shared wrapper had already been fixed,
// because nothing derived the obligation from the tree. This does: the screen
// list comes from the directory, so a NEW list screen is covered the day it is
// written rather than the day somebody remembers to add it here.
