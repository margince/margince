// `is_current_primary` is the SERVER's to decide when a request omits it — a
// contact's only current employment becomes their current primary one. A screen
// that states the field by hand takes that decision away, and the two screens
// that did it were the ones a real user reaches: the contact rail, which sent an
// untouched checkbox's `false`, and the generic relationship modal, which sent a
// literal for every kind while offering no primary control at all. Between them
// the rule could not fire from anywhere a contact actually works.
//
// Derived from the tree rather than from a list of the two known offenders: the
// literal is one line and trivial to reintroduce on a screen that does not exist
// yet, and nothing else would notice.
