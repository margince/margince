// The three verbs the company page hands the rep directly, so none of them
// is a click-through to another screen: open a deal on this account, tag it,
// or add it to a list. All three share CreateAction's button+modal shape
// (create.tsx), so the states worth a story are the same shape too: the
// resting button, the open form, mid-submit, and a failed submit. None of
// these controls reads a capability (no useCan anywhere in companyactions.tsx
// or create.tsx) — there is no read-only or permission-denied variant to
// cover, unlike companyraildetails' Archived story.
//
// The session still has to be stated, for a reason that is not object RBAC:
// CreateAction reads the workspace's system-of-record mode off /me and renders
// NOTHING on a mirrored screen in overlay mode (companies, deals — all three
// controls here). Every story below is a NATIVE workspace, which is what
// meFixture answers by default. The grants each one names are the ones its
// flow actually spends, so the session reads as the rep the story is about.
