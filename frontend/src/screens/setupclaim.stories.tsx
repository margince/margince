/**
 * The first-run claim (ADR-0105).
 *
 * An installation whose deployment file names no `bootstrap_admin` holds no
 * organization. Its boundary would otherwise render "installation not ready" —
 * true, and a dead end. This screen is what stands there when the installation
 * is instead WAITING to be claimed, and it is the only screen in the product
 * that creates an account without one.
 *
 * The states worth looking at are the ones a screenshot settles rather than an
 * assertion: whether the warning that this account is the installation's ROOT
 * reads as a warning, whether the token field reads as something copied from a
 * server log rather than a password, and whether a refusal is legible next to a
 * form the person has just filled in. The three refusals differ in meaning, not
 * just wording — a wrong token, an installation someone else already claimed,
 * and a field to fix are three different next actions — so each is a story.
