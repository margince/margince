 * unknown — and rendering a bare drop zone in any of them makes the same false
 * claim this field exists to stop, just later and more convincingly. Reading
 * documents needs its own grant, so a reader who cannot have them is told they
 * are withheld rather than shown an empty field about a contract that has
 * paper.
 *
 * AND IT NEVER PRESENTS A PAGE AS A LIST. The documents endpoint paginates, so
 * an agreement with more filed paper than one page holds is `partial` and says
 * how much is missing — never a truncated list under a field that reads as
 * complete.
