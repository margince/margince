 * ContractPaper is the signed document itself, on the row for the agreement it

 * from a matching title — a company with a 2024 and a 2026 framework agreement
 * has two files whose names differ by one digit, and matching on text would
 * hand a reader the wrong contract with full confidence.
 *
 * A contract with no paper renders NOTHING, not an error and not an empty
 * word. Recording what was agreed and filing the PDF are separate acts, and a
 * commercial record entered from an invoice is complete without a file.
 *
 * What it never does is present a PAGE as the paper. The documents endpoint
 * paginates, so a row that kept the first page and dropped `page.has_more`
 * showed some of the files under a label that reads as all of them — the same
 * silent truncation on the row as in the form, and the same fix: the chips the
 * read reached, and under them how many it did not.
 *
 * Each link is NAMED BY ITS FILE, not by a generic word for paper. This row is
 * the only place the file is read — the account's library below deliberately
 * leaves agreement paper to the agreement — so an amendment filed beside a
 * signed original has to be tellable from it, and two identical links are two
