// How a captured interaction is drawn and named, in ONE place.
//
// Since ADR-0107/A158 the KIND (what sort of interaction happened) and the
// TRANSPORT (what carried it) are separate axes, and reading one off the other
// is what drew an envelope beside every chat message on a contact page — on
// contacts who have no email address at all. So the icon comes from the kind,
// the transport name comes from the directory, and neither is inferred from the
// other.
//
// It lives beside the screens rather than in the design system because both
// halves are domain reads: the kind vocabulary is the activity contract's, and
// the label resolves through the installation's own transport directory.

// interactionIcon draws the kind, and ONLY the kind. Every case is a kind the
// activity contract declares; the fallback is deliberately a plain record mark,
// because an icon for a kind this build has never heard of can only be a guess
// about the transport, and the envelope that used to stand there was the wrong
// guess for every kind but one.
