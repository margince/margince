// Fitness function for the one way a mutation can refuse work the screen was
// plainly offering: a `mutationFn` that reads the value it needs out of its
// CLOSURE instead of taking it as the mutation's variable.
//
// `useMutation` re-arms its options in a PASSIVE effect
// (@tanstack/react-query's useMutation.js: `useEffect(() =>
// observer.setOptions(options))`). Between the commit that first renders a
// control with loaded state and the effect that hands the observer that
// render's closure, the observer still holds the PREVIOUS render's closure —
// the one where the state was null. A click landing in that window runs the
// older function, reads nothing, and refuses. React yields between commit and
// passive effects, so the window is real in a browser and merely wider on a
// loaded machine.
//
// The tell is a zero-parameter `mutationFn` that throws on a falsy check of a
// value it closed over. Such a guard cannot fire on a real path — the control
// that triggers it only renders once the value exists — so the only state it
// can ever report is the stale-closure window, and what it reports there is
// false: it tells a reader with a filled form that there is nothing to submit.
// A variable cannot be older than the control that carries it, so the fix is
// always the same shape: pass the value to `mutate()` and let the parameter
// replace the guard.
//
// WHAT THIS CATCHES: the guarded form, which is the one that produces a false
// refusal a user can see and report.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, deliberately: an unguarded closure read. Deciding
// which free identifier is component state and which is a stable prop needs
// the type checker and a rule about what counts, and a gate whose rules are
// fiddly is a gate that gets worked around rather than fixed. The guard is the
// author's own admission that the value can be absent, which is the honest
// place to draw the line.
