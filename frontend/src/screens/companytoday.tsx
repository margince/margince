// "Today on this account" — the record's daily brief, and the only part of
// the page that answers *what do I do now*. It replaces two earlier cards
// ("Today on this account" and "Worth doing next") that used to say the same
// things twice between them: this one merged reading, not two that agree.
//
// TWO PARTS. A CONTEXT block of dated readings — whose move it is, the way
// in, what was last said, what is running, what is wrong — and, under it,
// the MOVES: the advice rows and the two verbs (draft a follow-up, prepare a
// meeting) that act on that context. The context states what IS; the moves
// say what to DO about it, and the split between them is this component's
// whole reason to exist.
//
// THE SPLIT IS DRAWN, not merely ordered. The context sits on its own tinted
// plate, inset from the panel's edges; the moves run full-bleed on the panel's
// own ground with their verbs at the row's end. A reader can tell which half
// is which before reading a word of either, and nothing on the plate looks
// pressable.
//
// WITHIN THE BLOCK, ONE READING LEADS. Whose move it is, with how long it has
// stood that way, sits above a rule in its own weight; the readings that
// support it are a label-and-answer list beneath. That is a claim about
// importance and it is the only ranking on the panel — everything under the
// rule is drawn alike, because a reader who cannot predict an order stops
// trusting it.
//
// A reading that is BAD NEWS still says so, in colour: an account gone quiet,
// a deal stalled, a move that has been ours for weeks. Nothing else in the
// block is coloured, so the colour means one thing.
//
// The second rule is quieter and does more work: an item appears only when it
// has something to say. Missing data is not a recommendation — "no meeting
// scheduled" earns a line only when the system can name whom to contact and
// why, which is the suggestion engine's job, not this component's.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CARRY, and the rule behind it: a second,
// weaker rendering of a claim that already has a good one is the duplication
// the page's own rules forbid.
//
//   - the open tasks THEMSELVES, which the Tasks screen lists in full with
//     their quick actions. The footer's commitment reading answers how many
//     are open and how soon, and never repeats a subject you would act on
//     somewhere better;
//   - a converted pipeline total or a KPI reading the strip already carries
//     for the account's STANDING state — this band carries what is DATED.
//
// So this section earns its place by carrying what nothing else says: whose
// move it is, who can reach them, what was last said, what is running, what
// is wrong, and what to do about any of it.

 * What was last said, and when.

 * The subject of the most recent exchange, which is the one reading a rep
 * opens the page for that no other tile carries: the footer's commitment
 * reading says what we OWE, this says what was SAID.
 *
 * The pulse line under the title still names both directions with their dates,
 * and this does not replace it. The two answer different questions — the pulse
 * is who wrote last, which is the direction a rep acts on, and one tile could
 * only ever show the later of the two. This is what the exchange was ABOUT.
 *
 * TWO FILTERS, and neither is cosmetic. The timeline carries every activity
 * kind, so without them the head of the list can be a TASK — whose subject
 * this file refuses to render twice — or a meeting scheduled for next week,
 * which `occurred_at DESC` sorts to the top and which has not been said yet.
 *
 * A FACT: the subject is what the activity says, quoted rather than judged.
 * The builder returns null both when the section was withheld and when nothing
 * has been logged; it cannot tell those apart, and the withheld footer below
 * is what tells a reader they are missing what was said.
