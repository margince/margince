// is the canonical AA small-text role — a rule written against the LIGHT palette
// and, until this story, never looked at once both tokens re-resolved. The lines
// under test are the object hint and the file-format sentence, sitting beside a
// SegmentedControl whose selected segment is the loudest thing in the dialog.

// not want reversed — the outcome, the notice saying where it came from, and the
// undo that used to vanish the moment they navigated away.
//
// It carries no `play`, and that is the state under test: an operator who does
// not know their last import stopped half-way cannot finish it, so the wizard
// opens ITSELF for a run it picked up rather than waiting behind a verb.

// The reference it plants is self-clearing: every other story routes these reads
