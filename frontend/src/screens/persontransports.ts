/**
 * Which transport a NAMED message is on, and whether it can still be answered.
 *
 * A worklist row is about one message. Opening the composer on whichever
 * transport the person happens to lead with would draft a reply to the wrong
 * conversation — the same overstated promise that kept `moveHref` returning a
 * bare record href until the composer could honour the link.
 *
 * `chosen` is the transport to open on, absent when the message names none this
 * contact still has. `stale` says which of the two absences it is, and the
 * distinction is the whole reason this returns a pair rather than a transport:
 *
 *   - no id asked         → nothing named, no claim to keep, `stale` is false
 *   - named, resolved     → open on it
 *   - named, unresolvable → open on the default AND say so
 *
 * The third is a real shape rather than a defensive one: a channel disconnected
 * since the row was ranked, an address removed, a message archived out of the
 * page's own window. Falling back silently there is the defect this pair
 * exists to prevent — the reader asked to answer one conversation and would be
 * writing into another without being told.
