 *
 * Two feeds paged separately cannot simply be concatenated and sorted: below
 * the oldest row of a feed that still has more, the merge is missing rows it
 * does not know about, and the result reads as a complete history with gaps in
 * it — the one failure a reader cannot see. So the merged list ends at the
 * newest such boundary, and the caller says what was cut.
 *
 * A feed that is fully loaded imposes no boundary: nothing older is missing
 * from it. When neither feed has more, the merge is the whole history.
 *
 * The cut is STRICT. Both feeds page on (timestamp, id), not on timestamp
 * alone, so a feed whose oldest loaded row sits at T may still have unfetched
 * rows at exactly T. Keeping the boundary row would put a same-second gap
 * inside a stretch the merge presents as whole — which is the one failure this
 * function exists to prevent, reappearing one row further down.
