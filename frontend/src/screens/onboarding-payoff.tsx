/**
 * The payoff at the end of onboarding: what those two minutes actually bought,
 * counted rather than congratulated.
 *
 * Every cell is a number the backend produced. The interesting half is the
 * distinction the type enforces: `null` is not `0`.
 *
 *  - a number, INCLUDING zero, is something the server told us. "0 people
 *    found" is a real answer about a site with no team page, and it is more
 *    useful than silence.
 *  - `null` is the absence of the operation that would have produced the
 *    number — no site read at all on the manual path, `pages_read` missing
 *    from the wire, a voice profile that was never built. A zero printed for
 *    an absent input reads as "you failed to do this", which is a lie about
 *    work that never ran.
 *
 * So an absent cell is never drawn as a 0. Where the absence itself is worth
 * stating it says so (`absentLabel`), and where it is not the cell is omitted:
 * a grid with nothing to report about pages is a grid without a pages cell,
 * not a placeholder that looks like data.

 *
 * `resumedSession` is checked FIRST and, once true, ends the question: a
 * restored session's `startedAt` is a server instant, but `nowMs` is the
 * reader's own device clock, which the wire never corroborates — a device
 * clock that reads behind reality (wrong timezone, a machine that has been
 * asleep for days, no NTP) can shrink an old setup's elapsed time into the
 * fresh window and claim "this was an empty install minutes ago" about
 * something built long before this visit. A restore is never that: whatever
 * the clock says, the reader already left once, so the timeless sentence is
 * both the honest answer and the one the wire can prove without trusting a
 * clock this component does not own.
 *
 * A live, never-restored session still earns the fresh lead from the elapsed
 * check below, because both instants there come from the SAME clock reading
 * (the device that has been open the whole time) — the failure mode above
 * needs two independently-clocked visits to appear, which a restore is and a
 * live session is not.
 *
 * Every case the elapsed check itself cannot verify falls to the neutral
 * lead, which is true regardless of when the setup ran: no start instant on
 * the wire, an instant that will not parse, and an instant in the future — a
 * browser clock behind the server's turns a genuinely fresh setup negative,
 * and answering that with the timeless sentence costs a little colour
 * instead of telling a lie.
