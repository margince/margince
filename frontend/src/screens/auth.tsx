 * labels the form rather than the buttons.
 *
 * **Renders nothing when the capability is empty**, and that is the §19
 * enforcement point rather than a convenience: `oidc_providers` is served by
 * `/auth/capabilities`, so a control for a flow this installation cannot
 * complete never reaches the screen. An installation with no Google OAuth app
 * configured (or where the deployment's state-signing key/redirect base are
 * incomplete) serves `[]`, and this component draws nothing for it — exactly
 * as an installation with a configured app draws the button. Do not "fix"
 * this to render a disabled button, and do not seed a provider list into the
 * capability response — the empty list IS the gate, and this component must
 * keep asking only "did I get providers?".
 *
 * The one thing that may put providers here without a server is
 * `app/ui-preview.ts`, and it is not an exception to the above: it substitutes
 * at the CALL SITE in `AuthScreen`, off unless `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_OIDC` is set at
 * build time, and it draws the block without making the flow work. This
 * component cannot tell the difference and must not try to.
 *
 * **The label is the server's string, not ours.** The contract types it as
 * `{ key, label }` and documents `label` as the button text, so the installation
 * owns the wording and `t()` is not involved. The consequence is real: a German
 * reader sees the installation's English label. Only the MARK is ours to choose,
 * from `key`.
