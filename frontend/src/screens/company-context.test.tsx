// is a vi.fn, so its call log is readable, and the container is rendered.
//
// Measurement is why this is the fix rather than a bigger budget: the chain
// costs about a second and does not move under four times the CPU
// oversubscription, so a timeout here is a HANG and not a slow settle. Nothing
// about a busy runner explains ten seconds of work that takes 0.9. A larger
// SETTLE_MS, a retry or a sleep would each make the next occurrence quieter
