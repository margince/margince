/**
 * The unauthenticated surface, whole (ADR-0076).
 *
 * The Core is a design-system primitive now, so its own states live in
 * `Design System/Margince Core`; these stories are about the SURFACE — the two
 * regions, the runtime posture the identity region reads from the server, the
 * two narrow layouts where the regions stop being side by side, and the states
 * that are not a failed password.
 *
 * Two kinds of failure are treated differently here, and the split is an
 * argument rather than an accident. A LOGIN failure changes one sentence, so the
 * credential error, the login rate limit and the pending button are still not in
 * this catalog — they are asserted in `auth.test.tsx`, where a sentence can be
 * compared instead of eyeballed. A RESET failure changes what the surface
 * OFFERS: only a token verdict may offer "Request a new link", because minting
 * one supersedes the token the user is still holding. That is a difference in
 * controls, so each of the four is a story, driven through a real submit.
