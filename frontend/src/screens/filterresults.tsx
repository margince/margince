// The preview's first page as a table (AC-filters-and-views-5, the reading half).
//
// It renders through the catalog's ListTable rather than a grid of its own. That
// was worth checking rather than assuming: ListTable reads as a record-list
// component, but its column type is generic over the row — key, header, and a cell
// function — so a schema-derived projection fits it without pretending to be a
// record. A second table beside it would have been the easy mistake, and
// frontend/CLAUDE.md records that this tree has twice grown a duplicate surface
// exactly that way.
//
// What this file decides is WHICH columns to show, because the preview carries
// every non-generated column of the table and thirty columns is not a table
// anybody reads.
