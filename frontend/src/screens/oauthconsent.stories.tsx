// The screen where a human hands an agent their own authority. It reads its
// whole request out of the redirect FRAGMENT — every authorize param plus the
// single-use `consent` nonce the server armed against an HttpOnly cookie — so a
// story arrives the way the server sends a visitor: by setting the hash before
// the component mounts (OAuthConsent reads it once per mount).
//
// The nonce is stubbed, not earned. Nothing here holds the cookie half of the
// pair, so no story submits: the forms are rendered for review, and the flow
// itself belongs to oauthconsent.test.tsx, which drives the real POST.
//
// The rule the screen keeps, and the reason the stories split the way they do: a
// submittable form is rendered ONLY where a nonce is actually held. A refusal the
// human's next choice can fix carries its nonce back and keeps the selector; a
// terminal one hands back the request alone and presents no action at all.
