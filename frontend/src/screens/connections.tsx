 * so a node sitting there gets no label from them — a deal is not "a
 * stakeholder" because a stakeholder edge leaves it.

 * On the remaining kinds both ends mean something and the direction is what
 * says which. The hierarchy edge runs parent → child. A partner edge runs from
 * the organization that RECORDS it to its counterparty, so `referred_by`
 * pointing at this account means that company referred it, while pointing away
 * means this account referred them — calling both "referral" would lose which.
 * `co_sell_with` is the one partner edge whose sides read the same, so it gets
