// The account whose password an operator chose.
//
// A configured bootstrap hands the first admin a credential from a deployment
// file. The server refuses every route but the one that replaces it, so the
// contact is authenticated and can do nothing — and the login screen is the
// wrong answer, because their credentials are correct and using them again
// lands in the same refusal.
//
// This stands at the boundary instead, carrying the same card the settings page
// uses. One implementation of "change your password", reached two ways: nothing
// about the act differs here, only the reason for being sent to it.
