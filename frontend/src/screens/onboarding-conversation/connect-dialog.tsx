// The connect act's one dialog shell: a provider's ask, its own surface,
// never a card growing an inline panel underneath it. Built on the shared
// `Modal` atom (focus trap, Escape, focus return, `role="dialog"`) rather
// than a bespoke one — those guarantees already have their own passing
// tests, and a second implementation is a second place they can drift.
//
// The redirect that follows a real "allow" click leaves this dialog and the
// whole page behind; nothing here pretends otherwise. What the dialog owns is
// the ASK — what is about to be read, in plain words, before the reader
// leaves for the provider's own consent screen (or, for IMAP, before they
// hand over a credential at all).
