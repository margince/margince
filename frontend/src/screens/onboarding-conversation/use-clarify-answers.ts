// round-trip lands — on failure (or a reply that never confirmed the
// change) the answer rolls back, the question re-opens, and the human is
// told, so Continue can never ride on an unapplied decision.
//
// The legal-entity clarify is the one exception to "one field per answer":
// the contract authorizes exactly legal_name, by design (interfaces.md — a
// selected_option verifies a single field+value tuple and nothing else), so
// address and registration number are never in the server's reply. They
// were already on screen, in the SAME candidate the human just picked
// (CompanySiteRead.legal_entities, matched by name) — the entity fill pulls
// them from there once legal_name itself is authorized, with the same
// grounded provenance as any other site-read value, never as if it were a
// manual edit.
//
// One decision leaves one provenance, so the authorized legal_name travels
// with them rather than down the ordinary change path: that path is for a
// value the human TYPED and stamps it as their own assertion, which would
// leave the two fields the same pick filled reading as the site's evidence
// and the name they were picked by reading as hand-entered.
