 * Where a field stands, derived from the draft and the proposal in one place
 * so the tallies, the section nav and the row markers cannot disagree:
 * - `required` / `empty`: no value; required is the blocking kind.
 * - `typed`: the human wrote it this session: human truth, no meter.
 * - `stored`: carried in from the existing profile untouched (member path).
 * - `quoted`: the value came off the site's own legal notice, through the
 *   entity census rather than the graded extraction lane — either as the one
 *   company the site names, or as the candidate the human picked from
 *   several. It keeps that page's quote when the read captured one, but
 *   nothing measured a confidence for it, so it is banded nowhere: an
 *   unmeasured value must not read as a weak or a strong one.
 * - `high` / `med` / `low`: site-grounded and measured, banded by the shared
 *   confidenceLevel thresholds, never a hand-written label beside a number.
