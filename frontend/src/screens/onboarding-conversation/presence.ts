// How the Margince orb accompanies the conversation: ONE pure mapping from
// machine state to the Core scene's presence and progress ring, shared by
// every act so the choreography reads as one performer. The company read's
// live snapshot rides in as an extra argument because the machine holds only
// run identity, never poll payloads.
//
// The grammar is the agent's own lifecycle, and each phase takes the state that
// names what is actually happening: idle while the human owes the next move,
// ingest (with a progress ring) while pages or corpus material arrive, working
// while the agent reasons over what it has or composes from it, warning while
// it is stopped on something a person must resolve, error on a failed run. A
// confirmation settles the orb back to idle rather than a state of its own.
// Anything waiting on a person is the agent at REST: the surface's own card is
// what asks for the answer. Nothing here claims the agent is listening — it
// reads captured activity and never holds a conversation.
