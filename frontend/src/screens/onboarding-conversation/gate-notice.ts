// Why the reader is looking at the gate instead of a read in progress.
//
// The gate is a single-question screen with no thread, so the narration that
// explained a previous attempt is not on it. Without this, a returning
// administrator whose earlier read failed would meet a blank gate and be told
// nothing — the message existed, it just had nowhere to appear. So the same
// facts the thread would have narrated are composed into one finished sentence.
//
// Precedence is deliberate: what just happened outranks what happened last
// session. A failed POST is the newest news of all, then this run's terminal
// state, then a lost poll, then the restore recap, and last of all the plain
// fact that this is a setup being picked up rather than started.
