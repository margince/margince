// the same unit's channel messages carry the provider. Resolving only the first
// half is what put "Dispact" and `ext:dispact-connector:dispact` side by side in
// one list: one transport under two spellings, one of them provenance nobody
// outside this repository can parse.
//
// The fallback is still the RAW ID rather than a placeholder, and that part is
// deliberate: a provider this build has never heard of is exactly what a unit
// creates, and "telegram" read by a human beats "Unknown" or an empty cell. The
// directory is the resolver, not a gate — a label it cannot supply must not make
// the row unreadable.
