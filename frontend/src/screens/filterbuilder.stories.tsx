// The predicate builder: a tree of clauses, each offering only what the server's
// vocabulary admits for the field it names.
//
// What these stories document is the VALUE control, because it is the part whose
// right answer depends on the field. An operand is a record picker, a date, a
// two-way choice or a box, and picking wrong makes a field either unusable or
// silently wrong — a uuid box nobody can fill, or a free-text box over a closed
// set that answers "0 match" to a typo.
//
// There is no story for the OPEN listbox: Select portals it outside the story
// root, so the capture is indistinguishable from the closed state and would
// document nothing. That interaction is covered in filterbuilder.test.tsx, which
// can reach the portal.
