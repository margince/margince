// The registry is the ONE place the SPA learns what an installation composed.
// Two states have to hold at once, and they are not the same test: a composed
// tree must route into its unit, and the VANILLA tree — the empty registry the
// committed stub carries, which is what a bare `pnpm build` and every core
// developer's checkout compiles — must still build and answer cleanly for a
// unit route nobody enabled. A lookup that only worked against a populated
// registry would strand the empty lane on a crash or a blank frame, and the
// empty lane is the default one.
//
// The fixtures below stand in for a composed installation. They are NOT read
// from build/composition/: this suite runs in the vanilla lane, where that
// directory legitimately does not exist, so the composed case is exercised by
// handing the same shape the generator emits to the same function App.tsx
// calls. The generator's own output shape is pinned on the Go side
// (stubMatchesVanilla + emit_test.go), so the two halves cannot drift apart
// without one of them failing.
