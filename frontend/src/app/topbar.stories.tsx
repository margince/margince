/**
 * The one strip that is true of the whole session rather than of the page under
 * it: where you are, how you reach anything, which system of record is
 * answering, what is waiting on you, and who is signed in.
 *
 * Every frame renders the REAL frame — the `.app` grid, the sidebar beside it,
 * the bar as the first row of `<main>`. Nothing here is decoration. The bar is
 * three tracks, `minmax(0, 1fr) auto minmax(0, 1fr)`, and the search stands IN
 * that row rather than being taken out of it: the field therefore lands on the
 * centre of the CONTENT column — not of the window — and the trail beside it has
 * an edge to shrink and ellipsis against. A bar rendered at a hand-set width is a
 * picture of geometry the product does not use, and the one thing it would get
 * wrong is the thing worth looking at.
 *
 * The strip's height is one token, `--topbarH`, and the sidebar's head is
 * measured against it so the first destination's row begins on the line this
 * bar's rule ends on. That alignment is a claim about TWO components, so it can
 * only be read with the panel beside the strip — which is the other reason these
 * frames render the whole L rather than the bar alone.
 *
 * The sidebar control is live in every frame, so either state can be moved to
 * the other. What that shows is the search MOVING: it is centred on the column,
 * the column's left edge travels 188px, and the field travels half of that. A
 * field that stayed put under the toggle would be centred on the window, which
 * is the arrangement this bar was changed away from.
 *
 * TWO things these frames cannot promise on their own, both because `fe-uat`
 * captures every non-phone story at 1024px:
 *
 * - The labeled field and its two key caps belong to a `min-width: 1101px`
 *   arrangement, so the render gate photographs the collapsed glyph on every
 *   wide frame below. The caps are real only in Storybook, in a window wider
 *   than 1100px; `Narrow` is the frame that pins the small arrangement
 *   deterministically.
 * - The approvals bell is the other way round — it is hidden only under 700px,
 *   so 1024px does photograph it, and `Phone` is the frame where it is gone.
 *
 * fullscreen: the bar is the first row of the content column and the trail is
 * flush to that column's right edge, so Storybook's default canvas padding would
 * frame a geometry the product does not use.
