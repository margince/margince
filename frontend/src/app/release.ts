/**
 * The release this bundle was built from, and the one rule for comparing it.
 *
 * WHY THE SPA CARES. A customer pulls each role image by tag, and the tag
 * resolver answers each pull separately. Two pulls are two requests, so a
 * publish landing between them hands back a web tier and an api from different
 * releases; the OCI distribution protocol cannot express "these manifests or
 * none", so the registry cannot refuse it at the pull. The api and the worker
 * settle it between themselves against the database they share. This tier
 * cannot: it is a static bundle in a browser, so all it can do is ask the api
 * what release it is and refuse to render against a different one.
 *
 * It also covers the ordinary, much more frequent version of the same problem:
 * a tab left open across a deploy is running last week's bundle against this
 * week's api, and every request it makes is a guess about a contract that has
 * moved.
 *
 * THIS MIRRORS internal/shared/buildinfo ON THE GO SIDE — same "dev" sentinel,
 * same "unknown disables the comparison" rule — because the two halves have to
 * agree about what counts as a difference. There is no way to share the code
 * across the language boundary, so the obligation is to keep the two files
 * saying the same thing.
