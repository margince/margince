/**
 * The line under the orb, one item at a time.
 *
 * The agent's work is worth watching, and the way to make it worth watching is
 * to name each PIECE of it as it happens rather than to report a total. A bar
 * that says "reading 128 captured items" and then sits still for thirty seconds
 * reads as a hang. The same thirty seconds spent naming each item as it arrives
 * reads as speed, because a reader counts events and not seconds.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE.
 *
 * It is THIS READER'S work and nobody else's. Everything here comes out of the
 * query cache of the tab it is running in, so it cannot report what another
 * contact's session is doing even by accident. That is not a side effect of the
 * implementation, it is the reason for it: a status line that quietly narrated a
 * colleague's afternoon would be surveillance wearing a status light.
 *
 * It never invents a line. A cache key with no entry in `SAID` produces NOTHING
 * rather than a guess spelled out of its own key: "reading contact-360" is not
 * language, and a surface whose job is to be believed cannot afford a sentence
 * nobody wrote.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, and the reason is worth writing down. The overnight run:
 * it happens in the worker, hours before this tab existed, and the contract
 * serves no run-progress read and no stream, so nothing about it reaches a
 * browser. A write with no `mutationKey` is invisible for a much smaller reason,
 * which is that the cache cannot say which write it is. Both gaps show as the
 * state's own resting line, never as a fabricated event.
