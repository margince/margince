// What the SPA knows about the units an installation composed.
//
// The registry arrives through the "@composition/extensions" alias, which is
// the TypeScript mirror of GOWORK: the DEFAULT lane resolves the committed
// empty-tree stub at src/composition/extensions.gen.ts, and a composed lane
// (tsconfig.composed.json + MARGINCE_COMPOSITION_FRONTEND) repoints the alias
// at build/composition/frontend/. One program, two registries — never two
// programs, and never a committed file regenerated from a composed tree, which
// would destroy the empty-tree byte-identity the composition gates prove.
//
// Everything below is a pure function of that registry and takes it as an
// argument, defaulting to the composed one. That is not test scaffolding: the
// vanilla registry is empty by construction, so a lookup that read the module
// binding directly could only ever be exercised on its miss path.

 * The screens an installation composes, keyed by unit name.

 * implementation of it: both lanes' modules import it, and one of those modules
 * (`src/screens/ext/`) is outside the vanilla TypeScript program entirely — a
 * type imported from there would pull the whole excluded directory back into
 * it.
 *
 * A component, not a rendered node: React needs a stable type to mount, and a
 * registry of pre-rendered elements would build every unit's screen on every
 * route change including the ones nobody navigated to.
 *
 * Unkeyed by a union of unit names on purpose — the composed set is an
 * installation's, not this program's, so the lookup is a miss like any other
 * and App.tsx already renders the honest fallback for one.

 * The route segment every unit surface lives under: `#/ext/<name>`.
 *
 * Spelled once and exported, because App.tsx's switch and any caller building
 * a link have to agree — a registry keyed under a screen name the router never
 * dispatches on resolves nothing, however correct its lookup is. `ext_` is the
 * namespace token everywhere else in the tier (tables, roles, job kinds,
 * `/v1/ext/<name>` routes); this is its hash-route spelling.
 *
 * NOT REACHABLE FROM THE RAIL. `nav.ts` keeps `NAV_GROUPS` as the canonical
 * 12-item list whose order `rail.test.tsx` pins, and an installation cannot
 * add a thirteenth: enabling a unit is not the product growing a destination.
 * A unit is OFFERED in Settings instead, on the page that already holds the
 * kind of credential it is configured with — see `unitsForSecretScope` below
 * and `screens/extension-units.tsx`.
 *
 * `RAIL_LESS_SCREENS` was reviewed with it and is unchanged: a unit's screen
 * wants the rail like any other destination, and `nav.ts` marks Settings
 * current while it is open. What it does NOT get is a badge or a phone-bar
 * slot — both are the product's judgement about what deserves a person's
 * attention, and it cannot make one for a surface it did not write.

 * Both settings pages already carry exactly that meaning, which is why the
 * declared scope is enough and no unit names a destination.
 *
 * A unit declaring no secret is in neither list, and that is not a gap: a
