/**
 * The document's theme: resolved in ONE place, applied before React mounts.
 *
 * This exists because the theme used to be owned entirely by `useTheme` inside
 * `TopBar` — the AUTHENTICATED chrome. Every unauthenticated surface therefore
 * rendered with no `data-theme` at all: a reader whose OS is set to dark got the
 * light sign-in page, however carefully the dark tokens were authored. Worse, the
 * effect that set the attribute had no cleanup, so after signing out of a dark
 * session the stale `dark` persisted and the SAME screen rendered dark. One
 * screen, two appearances, neither of them chosen.
 *
 * Applying it at boot fixes both at once, and keeping the resolution here rather
 * than duplicating it means the boot path and the toggle cannot drift on what
 * "dark" means. Changing it lives here too, because several surfaces offer the
 * control — the account menu, the sign-in page and the onboarding rail — and
 * component-local state would let two of them disagree about the theme the
 * document is already showing.
 *
 * Two values, not one, and the distinction is the whole point of "system":
 * a CHOICE is what the contact picked (`ThemeChoice`, including "system"), a
 * THEME is what the document is painted in (`Theme`, only ever light or dark).
 * "system" resolves to a theme and keeps resolving: while it is the choice this
 * module follows `prefers-color-scheme` live, so an OS switch reaches an open
 * tab instead of waiting for a reload.
