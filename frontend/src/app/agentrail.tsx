// The agent's place in the app: the foot of the workspace rail, under the

// This is the ONE agent surface. Two others were built and judged first, a dock
// beside the page title and a bar across the foot of the viewport, and both put
// the agent in the content column, which is the column the reader is working in.
// Both then had to answer a question every other always-present thing answers
// with the rail: an agent that is always there belongs in the chrome that is
// always there.
//
// The rail also settles the SPLIT the bar was built to argue for. What the agent
// has on the page you are standing on, and what it is doing everywhere else, are
// two readings of different scope, and a horizontal bar spent its whole width
// keeping them apart. Stacked in a column they are simply two lines, and the
// panel that opens beside them carries the detail of both.

// are unreachable, the model the last call actually ran on, this account's own
