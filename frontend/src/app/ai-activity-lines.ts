The human's read is already narrated where it was started — the organization page polls the read's own status and draws it live (SiteReadPanel), and the taskbar carries a `site-read` key for the same action — so a rail line would be a third telling of one thing. The system's read belongs to nobody, exactly like the sweeps above. There is also a grain the rail could not render honestly: the occurrence key is correlation+task and one read's correlation is its site_read row id, so a single read files one occurrence PER LANE it runs — the extract lanes for an ordinary read, and site_triage on top for a domain-triage one, which is the only read that reaches all three",

Reachability: the one production site is the signature-enrichment pass, which runs under a system principal with no on_behalf_of, so ResolveActor scopes every occurrence to the workspace with a NULL actor_user_id while the personal feed selects on actor_user_id. Worth: it could not be per-person even if it were reachable. The pass mints ONE correlation id for the whole run (api/jobs.yaml capture_enrich, up to 100 candidates in series), and the occurrence key is correlation+task, so every candidate collapses into ONE row — a per-person subject would make that single row flap from one person to the next rather than narrate any of them.
