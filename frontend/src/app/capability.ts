// Scoping an affordance to the permission it actually needs.
//
// The four predicates this replaces asked which ROLE the user held and inferred
// the grant from the seeded matrix. That inference is only true of a freshly
// bootstrapped installation: the server reads live `role.permissions` at
// authentication, so on any workspace whose stored grants have drifted — an
// object added after bootstrap, an operator-edited role — the client and the
// server disagree, and the client renders a button the server then refuses.
//
// So the answer comes from the server (GET /me carries the merged grants it
// computed) and only the VOCABULARY comes from the contract. `RbacObject` and
// `RbacAction` are generated from crm.yaml's enums, so a misspelled object or
// verb is a TypeScript error rather than a check that compiles and silently
// denies forever.
//
// This is UX honesty, never enforcement: the server's auth.Require is the
// authority on every call, and a client that gets this wrong shows the wrong
// button, not the wrong data.

 * created itself — additive-only ownership is the property that makes an
 * installation's contract reproducible, and an enum-append action would spend
 * it. Widening here instead costs the core vocabulary nothing: a misspelled
 * CORE object is still a type error, because a string that does not start with
 * `ext_` has to be a member of the enum.
 *
 * The runtime never needed the change — `/me`'s `authorization.objects` is
 * string-keyed and already carries registered extension objects — so this is
 * the client catching up to a response it was already being handed.
 *
 * THE COST, stated rather than discovered: this template accepts ANY
 * `ext_`-prefixed string, so a misspelled EXTENSION object compiles. `useCan`
 * then finds no grant and denies, which looks from the screen exactly like a
 * grant the operator has not made — the two failures are indistinguishable
 * without reading `/me`. That is inherent to a vocabulary whose members depend
 * on the COMPOSED SET rather than on the contract: the union cannot be
 * generated because it is not known until an installation is chosen. It is a
 * deliberate trade-off, not an oversight, and only the CORE half of this union
