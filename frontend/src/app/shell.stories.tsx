 * middle of adding a colleague.
 *
 * Rendered in both states side by side because the row has two geometries and
 * only one of them is a reading. Expanded it takes the destinations' own metrics

 * second grid. Collapsed it keeps 44px like every other row at that width, drops
 * to the glyph, and carries the reading in a tooltip on hover and on keyboard
 * focus.
 *
 * ONE half of that is not what this frame photographs, and the reason is worth
 * more than the frame. The collapsed panel's rows are 44px, so its intrinsic
 * height is 774px — and `.rail.collapsed` sets `overflow: visible` so the
 * collapsed tooltips can escape its 56px box, which means it neither scrolls nor
 * clips. In a window shorter than that the foot is simply BELOW the bottom of the
 * viewport with nothing to scroll, and `fe-uat` captures at 720px. So the right
 * half of this frame shows the destinations and no foot at all. The expanded
 * panel is unaffected (34px rows, and it does scroll); read the collapsed foot in
 * Storybook in a window taller than 775px, and treat the shortfall as a note
 * against the panel rather than against the frame.

 * heading names it, and the switcher under the heading names the entry the reader

 *
 * Rendered from the parts rather than through `Shell`, because the real settings
 * section is published from live grants: the rail and the head are both handed the

 *
 * The bar itself carries five glyphs and no captions — four destinations and
 * More. Every row keeps its name in `aria-label`, so nothing is lost to a screen
 * reader or a voice-control user; the words are simply not drawn at a size where
 * they would be legible, and the sheet behind More is where they come back.
 *
 * One thing about the viewport tool is worth knowing before trusting a picture
 * of this: it is applied by the MANAGER, which resizes the preview iframe, and
 * these are viewport media queries — so a story opened as a bare `iframe.html`,
 * which is how the fe-uat capture gate renders, would get the harness's own width
 * and draw the SIDEBAR. `uat-phone` is what stops that: the gate reads the tag and
 * drives the browser itself to 390px. Without it every story named for a phone was

 * the one thing in the chrome that reports rather than navigates as an eleventh
 * place to go. What the cell it left behind buys the sheet is the room for the
 * whole list: the ceiling is the viewport less the ledge it stands on and the
 * same air again at the top, and the ten destinations now sit inside it without
 * scrolling. It is still a scroller — a longer locale or a level with more rows
 * will reach that ceiling.
 *
 * The close control is the same More button in its other state, renamed, and it
 * is PINNED to the head's corner rather than left at the end of a scrolling list
 * — a reader who opened the sheet by mistake should not have to walk ten rows to
 * leave it. There is deliberately no grab handle: a handle is a control on every
 * platform that documents one, and this sheet has one height and no drag, so
 * drawing it would promise a gesture that does nothing.
 *
 * The route is Reports, which the bar does not carry. That is the case the sheet
 * exists to answer: the current page's own row is `display: none` in the bar, so
 * the closed bar reports it through More instead, and opening the sheet is what
 * makes it visible. It is also why the scrim and the `inert` content column are
 * part of the frame rather than decoration — the page under a sheet this size has
 * to stop being reachable by Tab, not merely be dimmed.
 *
 * `uat-phone` is what makes the capture gate drive the browser to 390px, and the
 * `play` below opens the sheet the way a reader does; there is no prop that forces
 * it open, and adding one would put a control in the product that exists only for
 * the catalog. The focus ring on the first row in the captured frame is that
 * opening, not a stray state: a sheet that covers the page has to take focus with
 * it, or a keyboard reader is left tabbing through a page they can no longer see.

/**
 * The phone bar, closed — three destinations, the agent, and More.
 *
 * Five cells of equal width, and only three of them are places to go. The middle
 * one is the agent, and everything about how it is drawn is one claim: it is a
 * different KIND of thing from the four glyphs around it. It rises out of the
 * bar's top edge in a round well of the bar's own material, it carries the only
 * lit object in the chrome, and it has no caption — the bar has no captions at
 * all, and a word under the one cell with room for one would read as a label for
 * the bar rather than for the agent. Its accessible name says the rest.
 *
 * The Worklist is what the bar gave up for that cell. It is a tap away in the
 * sheet, which is the same distance the other six destinations already are.
 *
 * Position is load-bearing twice over. It is the CENTRE because the agent
 * belongs to the whole session rather than to any destination, so it stands
 * outside the row of them rather than at one end. And it is the third cell in
 * the DOM as well as on screen (app/navlevel.tsx renders it into the row stream),
 * so a thumb and a Tab key read the bar in the same order — a cell placed by a
 * grid column alone would have been third to the eye and last to the keyboard.

 * rather than as a sheet that arrived from nowhere.
 *
 * It is MEASURED from the well, not from the cell behind it — the well rises
 * clear of the bar, and a frame taken from the cell would open the panel across
 * the orb it belongs to. And it carries a notch that points back down at that
 * well, drawn on the portalled wrapper rather than on the panel, because the
 * panel scrolls its own body and would clip anything outside it. The notch's x
 * is the measured middle of the well, so it still lands if the bar's cells ever
 * stop being even.
 *
 * There is no scrim. This is a popover, not the More sheet: the page behind it
 * stays live and readable, an outside tap or Escape closes it, and focus goes
 * back to the orb. A dimmed page would claim the reader has to answer something
 * before carrying on, and there is nothing here to answer.
