// Three tracks, the outer two equal, so the search sits at the middle of the
// CONTENT column — the reference this follows centres there too, and a field
// centred on the window sits visibly left of the column it stands in.

// The sidebar's shortcut, spelled the way the platform spells it — the palette's
// label helper answers the same question for ⌘K.
