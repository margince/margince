// The /me body a test serves, built from the grants under test rather than
// from a role name.
//
// Tests used to stub `roles: ["admin"]` and rely on the screen inferring
// capability from it. That made every assertion a statement about the seeded
// matrix — so a screen wired to the WRONG object still passed, because admin
// holds everything and one wrong grant looks exactly like the right one.
//
// Naming the grants makes the binding testable: a fixture that allows
// `automation:update` and nothing else proves the screen asks for exactly
// that. Divergent fixtures (one object granted, its neighbour not; one action
// granted, its sibling not) are the point, not an edge case.
