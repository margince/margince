 * UI-preview scaffolding for design review. **Not a feature flag.**

 * of already-built, capability-gated MARKUP visible on the running app so it can
 * be reviewed at full size, in both themes, at real breakpoints — the things
 * Storybook shows in isolation but a stakeholder walking the screen never sees.
 * Every switch is OFF unless its env var is set at dev/build time, so a plain
 * `pnpm build` and a plain `pnpm dev` behave exactly as if this file did not
 * exist.
 *
 * The naming rule is the whole point: `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_*`. A reader who greps
 * for it must not be able to mistake it for a capability toggle. These switches
 * cannot make a flow work — only draw one.

 *
 * Why it exists: `/auth/capabilities` serves `oidc_providers: []` because the
 * OIDC flow has not shipped (§19), and `ProviderButtons` correctly renders
 * nothing for an empty list. That gate is right and stays right — but it also
 * means the federated block, which IS designed and built, can only be seen in
 * Storybook. A UI/UX review of the login screen needs it on the login screen.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it does not touch the wire or the query cache.
 * `startFederatedSignIn` (screens/auth.tsx) checks this same switch and stays
 * inert under it — the real flow is a full-page navigation to an endpoint this
 * preview build never mounts, and letting the click through would take the
 * whole review tab to a 404 instead of drawing the design.
 *
 * Read at the call rather than at module load so a test can pin BOTH positions
 * of the switch without re-evaluating the module graph. `import.meta.env` is a
 * compile-time substitution either way: with the var unset this is
 * `isOn(undefined)`, i.e. `false`, in every build.

/**
 * `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_RESET=1` — draw the "Forgot password?" link even though this
 * installation reports the reset capability as off.
 *
 * Why it exists: unlike OIDC, this flow is finished on BOTH sides. The contract
 * documents `POST /auth/forgot-password` and `POST /auth/reset-password`, the
 * handlers are `backend/internal/modules/identity/reset.go`, and this screen
 * already renders all four views behind the link — the request form, the neutral
 * "check your inbox" confirmation, the emailed deep link's new-password form, and
 * the spent-token refusal. What is missing is one operator setting.
 * `AuthCapabilities.password_reset` is computed live as `h.resetMailer != nil`,
 * and the shipped `config/margince.yaml` carries no `email:` block, so
 * `Email.Enabled` is false, no mailer is wired, and the capability answers
 * `false` on every local run. The link is right to be absent there — and a design
 * review that only ever sees the local run never sees the link, or the card behind
 * it, at all.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it does not wire a mailer, and it does not fake one. What
 * becomes reviewable is the link and the request card it opens — the real one,
 * posting to the real endpoint. Against a mailer-less installation that post is
 * answered `501 not_implemented` (`httperr.NotImplemented`; a status this path does
 * not enumerate in `crm.yaml`) and the card shows it as its failure note, so the
 * confirmation, the deep-link form and the spent-token refusal stay where they
 * were — asserted in `screens/auth.test.tsx`, not on this screen. The switch draws
 * the door and the door opens; the room behind it is the installation's to
 * configure.
 *
 * Read at the call rather than at module load, for the same reason as the OIDC
 * switch above.

 * Core states describe an overnight run no read can reach. The only way to judge
 * how those look is to walk the real screens wearing them, because what is being
 * judged is how the section sits in a rail that collapses beside a page that
 * scrolls. Storybook shows the states; it cannot show that.
 *
 * What the section itself draws is READ, not invented: approvals waiting, which
 * sources are unreachable, the open duplicate queue, whether this deployment has
 * a model bound, the model the last call was served by, and the account's own
 * suggestions. A read that has not answered draws nothing rather than a zero.
 *
 * What this switch adds is the part no read can reach. Three states, the
 * overnight run taking captured mail in, traversing the graph and drafting, have
 * nothing behind them: the contract serves no run phase and no stream. With the
 * switch on, all five are offered from the panel under a heading that says
