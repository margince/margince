/**
 * UI-preview scaffolding for design review. **Not a feature flag.**
 *
 * Nothing here changes what the product can do. Each switch below makes a piece
 * of already-built, capability-gated MARKUP visible on the running app so it can
 * be reviewed at full size, in both themes, at real breakpoints — the things
 * Storybook shows in isolation but a stakeholder walking the screen never sees.
 * Every switch is OFF unless its env var is set at dev/build time, so a plain
 * `pnpm build` and a plain `pnpm dev` behave exactly as if this file did not
 * exist.
 *
 * The naming rule is the whole point: `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_*`. A reader who greps
 * for it must not be able to mistake it for a capability toggle. These switches
 * cannot make a flow work — only draw one.

/**
 * `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_OIDC=1` — draw the federated sign-in buttons on the login
 * screen even though this installation serves none.
 *
 * Why it exists: `/auth/capabilities` serves `oidc_providers: []` because the
 * OIDC flow has not shipped (§19), and `ProviderButtons` correctly renders
 * nothing for an empty list. That gate is right and stays right — but it also
 * means the federated block, which IS designed and built, can only be seen in
 * Storybook. A UI/UX review of the login screen needs it on the login screen.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it does not touch the wire or the query cache, and it
 * does not disable a REAL provider. `startFederatedSignIn` (screens/auth.tsx)
 * stays inert only when `previewedOidcProviders` actually invented the button
 * a click came from — an installation that genuinely serves OIDC providers
 * keeps working buttons even under this switch. Only the synthesized case has
 * nowhere real to go: the full-page navigation would be to an endpoint this
 * preview build never mounts, taking the whole review tab to a 404 instead of
 * drawing the design.
 *
 * Read at the call rather than at module load so a test can pin BOTH positions
 * of the switch without re-evaluating the module graph. `import.meta.env` is a
 * compile-time substitution either way: with the var unset this is
 * `isOn(undefined)`, i.e. `false`, in every build.

/**
 * `VITE_UI_PREVIEW_RESET=1` — draw the "Forgot password?" link even though this
 * installation reports the reset capability as off.
 *
 * Why it exists: unlike OIDC, this flow is finished on BOTH sides. The contract
 * documents `POST /auth/forgot-password` and `POST /auth/reset-password`, the
 * handlers are `backend/internal/modules/identity/reset.go`, and this screen
 * already renders all four views behind the link — the request form, the neutral
 * "check your inbox" confirmation, the emailed deep link's new-password form, and
 * the spent-token refusal. What is missing is one operator setting.
 * `AuthCapabilities.password_reset` is computed live as `h.resetMailer != nil`,
 * and the shipped `config/margince.yaml` carries no `email:` block, so
 * `Email.Enabled` is false, no mailer is wired, and the capability answers
 * `false` on every local run. The link is right to be absent there — and a design
 * review that only ever sees the local run never sees the link, or the card behind
 * it, at all.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it does not wire a mailer, and it does not fake one. What
 * becomes reviewable is the link and the request card it opens — the real one,
 * posting to the real endpoint. Against a mailer-less installation that post is
 * answered `501 not_implemented` (`httperr.NotImplemented`; a status this path does
 * not enumerate in `crm.yaml`) and the card shows it as its failure note, so the
 * confirmation, the deep-link form and the spent-token refusal stay where they
 * were — asserted in `screens/auth.test.tsx`, not on this screen. The switch draws
 * the door and the door opens; the room behind it is the installation's to
 * configure.
 *
 * Read at the call rather than at module load, for the same reason as the OIDC
 * switch above.

 *
 * What it CAN do is stand in for the right server. A German installation's
 * operator writes German labels, so a hard-coded English label stands in for an
 * English installation — and shows a German reviewer a screen no German
 * installation serves. Taking the label from the caller, which is the one place
 * that knows the locale, makes the stand-in follow the reader instead.
 *
 * The keys live in this `.ts` module rather than in `auth.tsx` for a second
 * reason: the no-inline-copy gate (`design-system/conformance.test.ts`) walks JSX
 * text and four user-facing attributes in `.tsx` files, and a provider key is

 * The provider keys the preview marks as **not yet available**, so a reviewer can

 * part rather than an implementation note. `AuthCapabilities.oidc_providers`
 * items are typed `{ key, label }` and carry NO availability field — there is no
 * wire shape a real server could use to say this, so a real server can never
 * produce a marked provider. `ProviderButtons` therefore behaves identically in
 * the product: it receives an empty set, and an empty set is the same component
 * it was before this existed. Nothing about the shipped surface changes, which is
 * why this needs no spec amendment.
 *
 * The spec position, plainly: §3.3 of the login spec ("honest functionality")
 * forbids a disabled provider control, naming Google, Microsoft and SSO
 * explicitly, and ADR-0076 keeps §3.3 load-bearing rather than relaxed — Decision
 * 1's own prose bans a control whose behaviour does not exist. A marked button is
 * exactly that control, so it is illegal on the PRODUCT surface and stays
 * illegal. What makes this legal is what it is: a design-review fixture in the
 * same class as a Storybook story, off unless a build-time var is set, never
 * reachable by a user of a shipped build.
 *
 * `served` is the same real capability answer `previewedOidcProviders` reads —
 * a non-empty list means this installation genuinely serves at least one
 * provider, and the preview marker must not fall on any of THOSE (a real
 * `microsoft` button disabled by a build-time var an operator never asked
 * about is the honest-functionality violation this fixture exists to avoid,
 * not to commit).
