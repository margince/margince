// -record chip and the account menu.
//
// Three of those five are proved here, because three of them are the top bar's
// own: the toggle, the trail and the search. The chip and the account menu are
// components with suites of their own (sormodechip.test.tsx, account.test.tsx);

// that they are mounted (shell.test.tsx).

// top bar. It stands inside the scroller above the content it names, and its
// rules are PageTitle's, in shell.test.tsx.

// construction — a unit's trail could otherwise only ever be exercised on its
