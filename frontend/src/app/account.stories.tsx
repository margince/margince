// The strip's own sheet, loaded because THIS file builds a `.topbar` by hand and

// written when `.topbar` still lived in shell.css, and the strip moved out into a
// sheet of its own with the shell restructure. Without this line every frame
// below drew an UNSTYLED strip: `display: block`, no height, no ground, no rule,
// the trail at the left edge and the menu anchored to the viewport instead of to
// the block. The frames still passed the render gate, because an unstyled

/**
 * Who is signed in, and the two things the product now offers nowhere else: the
 * door into settings, and the appearance choice.
 *
 * ONE chrome: the avatar at the end of the strip's trail, with the menu dropping
 * out of it and the theme flyout opening LEFT because there is no room on the
 * right. The block had a sidebar form once — a row at the foot of the column,
 * menu rising, flyout mirrored — and it went with the foot it stood in; the
 * sidebar carries the installation's entitlement there now (Shell/Navigation
 * shell). Nothing here photographs an arrangement a reader cannot reach.
 *
 * The chip is the design system's `Avatar` rather than a mark of this block's
 * own: the monogram is taken the same way everywhere, and the tint is keyed on
 * the ADDRESS, so the reader carries one colour from the chrome to their own
 * account page and a rename does not move them to another one.
 *
 * fullscreen: the block measures itself against the container it sits in — the
 * strip's trail is flush to the content column's right edge, and the menu's drop
 * offset is computed from the strip's own height — so every story renders the
 * real chrome. Storybook's default canvas padding would frame a geometry the
 * product does not use.

/**
 * The block in the top bar's trail, which is where the product renders it.
 *
 * The strip is the real one, INSIDE the real frame: `.app`, the sidebar taking
 * its column, the bar as the first row of `<main>`. That is not ceremony. Both
 * numbers the strip is built from — `--topbarH` and `--pageGutter` — are declared
 * on `.app` (app/shell.css), so a bar rendered on the bare canvas resolves them
 * to nothing: `height` and `padding` are then invalid declarations, the strip
 * collapses to its content, loses its gutter, and puts the trigger hard against
 * the WINDOW instead of against the content column's edge. The account menu's own
 * drop offset is computed from `--topbarH` too, so it lands wrong in the same
 * breath.
 *
 * All THREE of the bar's tracks are rendered, and the middle one is why: the
 * strip is `minmax(0, 1fr) auto minmax(0, 1fr)`, so a frame that supplied only a
 * lead and a trail put the trail in the MIDDLE track and left the third one
 * empty — the block then sat near the centre of the bar, which is the one thing
 * about its position these frames are for. The slot is the search's own, left
 * empty: what the trail needs from it is its width, and a live field here would
 * be a second component in a frame about this one. Below 1100px, where `fe-uat`
 * captures, the real slot is a 36px glyph and this one is 0px — so the block in
 * the captured frames sits about a glyph's width right of where it really does.
