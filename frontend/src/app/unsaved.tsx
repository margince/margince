/**
 * Unsaved edits, and what happens when the reader leaves without saving them.
 *
 * A draft that is discarded without a word — a rewritten signature, a retyped
 * installation name, a voice profile somebody spent ten minutes on — is one
 * sidebar click away on every form in the product. Silently is the part that
 * matters: a form that warns you is annoying, a form that loses your work
 * without asking teaches you not to trust it with anything long.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because there are two ways to leave and only one of them is
 * ours to intercept.
 *
 * A RELOAD or a closed tab is the browser's to ask about, through
 * `beforeunload`, and the browser's own dialog is the only thing allowed to
 * appear there — a page cannot render its own confirm at that point, and every
 * attempt to reads as a page fighting the window.
 *
 * A move WITHIN the app is ours, and it is asked with this product's own
 * `ConfirmModal`. `UnsavedGuard` is rendered ABOVE the routed screen (App.tsx),
 * because a guard can only hold the moves it is still mounted for: inside a
 * screen it caught that screen's own tabs and lost everything the instant the
 * reader left for another page. What it holds is CONTENT, never the URL. A guard
 * wired into `hashchange` would also intercept Back and Forward, where undoing
 * the browser's own history gesture means rewriting entries underneath the
 * reader — and the failure mode of getting that wrong is broken navigation for
 * everybody, far worse than the loss it prevents. So the subtree waits, the URL
 * is allowed to move, and the browser's gestures are left alone.

 * several components apart — the card that owns the textarea is inside the tab
 * that is inside the screen that would hold the answer — and threading a boolean
 * up through that is how one card ends up guarded and the next one does not.
 *
 * Safe to call outside a provider: it reports nothing, which is the honest
 * behaviour for a card rendered somewhere no guard is installed (a story, a
 * test, a record page). A hook that threw there would make the provider a
 * requirement of every caller rather than of the surfaces that want guarding.
