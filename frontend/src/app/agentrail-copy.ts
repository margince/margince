 * the licence. Six subjects taking turns in one slot at the edge of every screen
 * is why a reader could not say what the line was for. What went is not lost,
 * it moved to where it is acted on: the spend has its own figure in the block,
 * the duplicates have their queue, and the licence is stated on the card in

 * would teach a reader that none of the line means anything, which is exactly
