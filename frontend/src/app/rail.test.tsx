// It is destinations only: the canonical 13-item nav in order (AC-shell-1b —
// Automations left it for Settings → AI while the dedupe queue and the filter
// builder took rows, which is a UI divergence on the founder's back-fill list),
// at most one active
// item tracking the route (AC-shell-2), badges only on the attention screens and
// only from live counts (AC-shell-1e), collapsed rows on the expanded rows' own
// geometry with a dismissible tooltip (AC-shell-1d), and the phone bar with its
// More sheet. It carries no search row, no collapse control, no Settings door
// and no account block any more — each of those moved to the top bar
// (topbar.test.tsx).
//
// The second suite is the panel's own DEPTH: a section route replaces the
// destinations with that section's entries, one level at a time, with the way
// back up in the panel. A few of those cases drive the whole Shell, because
// where the reader walked down FROM is remembered above the rail and a rail on
// its own always answers "home".
//
// What the shell composes around this panel — the page title, the top bar's
// mounting, sign-out — is shell.test.tsx's.
