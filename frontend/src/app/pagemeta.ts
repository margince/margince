// and the content column's heading both answer from here, so the crumb and the
// h1 under it can never name the same page two different things.

// The line under the page's name, for the screens whose name alone does not
// say what the page is for. It belongs to the page rather than to anything on
// it, which is why it lives beside the title keys: a screen that printed its
// own subtitle had to print its own title above it to hang it on, and the
// shell was already printing that title — the page then named itself twice.

/**
 * Screens that head THEMSELVES, so the shell prints no heading above them.
 *
 * Home greets the reader by name in its own h1 — "Guten Morgen, Demo." — and
 * the shell's own nav label above it named the page a second time at heading
 * level.
 * Two top-level headings is no outline at all, and it is the same defect the
 * shell already avoids for a record (whose name is its heading) and a unit.
 *
 * A screen earns a place here by rendering an h1 of its own, not by having a
 * heading somewhere on it. A screen whose own heading is an h2 still wants the
 * shell to name the page.

 * the column. The agent asked it separately once and printed the route's raw id,
 * so the chrome offered to answer questions about `01a01811-c847-…` while the
 * trail two inches above it said "Carol Wagner".
 *
 * A hook, because the answer is a read. `useEntityName` is called on every route
 * so the hook order never depends on which page is on screen, and it makes no
 * request without an id to resolve.
 *
 * The three ways a read can leave this without a name are not one case. A read
 * that FAILED says so: the id is the thing the reader cannot act on, and
 * printing it for a 403 made a refusal indistinguishable from a record whose
 * display field is blank. A read still in flight, and one that answered with no
 * name, both fall back to the id — which is not a name, but is true, and is what
 * the reader can quote.
