// The system-of-record mode chip: in overlay mode the whole installation
// reads from an incumbent mirror, which changes what every screen can do —
// list sort/filter dials narrow, some reads answer "not available", and
// mirrored-record writes refuse. Any seat looking at the topbar should be
// able to tell this is happening, not just the admin who is on the Settings
// card that manages it. It reads the already-cached ["me"] query (the same
// probe AuthGate already resolved before any screen mounted), so mounting it
// costs no extra request and it never renders ahead of a real answer. Native
// mode renders nothing — the chip is a state marker, not a permanent fixture.
//
// The MODE is for every seat; the DESTINATION is not. Integrations lives in
// Admin settings, which only an operator seat reaches, so a link offered to a
// rep would land them on the Account fallback — a chip that lied about where it
// went. So the fact keeps its place for everyone and only an operator gets the
// affordance, which is the same rule the rail's license chip follows.
