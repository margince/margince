/**
 * What the agent surface knows about the person using the app, as opposed to
 * what it knows about the database.
 *
 * The taskbar's right half reports the workspace, which arrives from reads. Its
 * left half reports the SCREEN, and most of what a reader experiences as "it
 * noticed" is this half: not a query answering, but the chrome tracking what
 * they are doing — the rows they selected, the record they have been sitting on,
 * the thing they just saved.
 *
 * The direction matters. Screens PUBLISH; chrome READS. Chrome that reached into
 * screens to work out what was happening would need a branch per screen and
 * would go quietly wrong every time one was rewritten — and it could only ever
 * guess at what a selection MEANS. A screen naming its own state is a screen
 * that stays correct when it changes.
 *
 * What travels here is STANDING state: it is true until the screen says
 * otherwise, and the bar shows it for as long as it stands. Moments — a write
 * landing, a record being read — do not, because both are already legible from
 * the caches the app keeps (app/writewatch.ts), and a channel screens had to
 * remember to fire would go quiet exactly on the screen nobody updated.
