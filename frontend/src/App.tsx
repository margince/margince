// is a not-found page rather than a surface that reads as unbuilt.

// The routed screens arrive as their own chunks, so a visitor who has only
// reached the login form downloads the form rather than every screen in the
// product: a screen's code arrives when somebody navigates to it.
//
// What stays STATIC is what a first paint genuinely needs — the shell, the auth
// surfaces, the router — plus screens/onboarding, whose company probe the shell
// itself calls. A module that is imported statically anywhere lands in the entry
// chunk whatever a dynamic import elsewhere says, so splitting it would cost a
// round-trip and save nothing.
// Every route chunk, registered as it is declared. A screen is split so the
// login screen does not carry the app, and warmed once a session exists so a
// reader past that point never pays the fetch on a click — splitting alone
// moves the cost from first paint onto the first navigation to each screen,

// paint a blank frame.
//
// A unit surface comes from one of two places, in this order:
//
//   1. The unit's OWN screen: extensions/<name>/frontend/ is a pnpm workspace
//      package (@margince-ext/<name>) whose default export is a component, and
//      gen-composition lists it in the composed screen registry
//      ("@composition/screens"). notes, the reference extension, is the one
//      such screen today. This is unit-authored TSX compiled into the SPA
//      bundle, which is why collectUnitFrontend refuses a package that is not
//      private, mis-named, or takes a direct dependency on a hosted framework,
//      and why check-ext-imports.sh gates what such a screen may import.
//   2. Otherwise the contract-derived descriptor set — the operations the
//      unit's fragments published, which is all the app can honestly say about
//      a unit nobody wrote a screen for (de, crm-hello).
//
// The registry is consulted only AFTER the descriptor resolves, so a screen
// cannot render for a unit this installation did not compose: an entry for a
// disabled unit is inert rather than a route into a surface with no server
// behind it.
// The generated registry is emitted UNTYPED, and the annotation lands here.
//
// That file is written to two locations at different depths — the vanilla stub
// under src/composition/ and the composed output under build/composition/ —
// and stubMatchesVanilla requires the two to be byte-identical, so it can carry
// neither a relative type import (the paths would differ) nor a bare one
// (nothing resolves from build/composition/). Annotating at the import site
// costs nothing and moves the check rather than losing it: a unit whose default
// export is not a component fails HERE, in core, in the composed lane, at the

          which makes moving to another THING a REMOUNT rather than a
          re-render. Two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one. A
          screen carries state about the record it was opened for — an expanded
          section, a half-typed note, a scroll position — and reconciling one
          record's screen into another's keeps all of it, which is how a note
          begun on person A ends up on the form for person B. And an arrival
          animation (design-system/enter.css) plays when a block is INSERTED:
          without a key the DOM nodes are reused, so walking from one record to
          the next would be the one navigation in the product where the page
          changes with no motion at all.

          The identity, NOT the whole address, and that distinction is the
          difference between a tab and a destination. A tab segment names a view
          of the thing already on screen, so remounting on it threw away a page
          the reader had not left: the header, the readings, the rail and the tab
          strip they had just clicked all re-animated, and every query on the
          page re-observed and refetched.

          Two things deliberately still key on the WHOLE address. The guard below
          does, because a half-typed note is worth asking about however small the
          move is; and the shell's scroll reset does, because a panel swapped
          under a reader who had scrolled past the tab strip should still open at
          its top.

          A Fragment rather than a wrapper element: the key belongs to the
          subtree, and the shell's content column must keep the screen's own
          root as its child (shell.css sizes `.wrap` and a full-height `.lt`
          against it). */}
      {/* The guard sits HERE, above the screen, and not inside any one of them.
          Inside a screen it can only see moves within that screen: a settings
          draft was safe from one tab to the next and still discarded the moment
          the reader clicked Contacts, because the screen holding the guard
          unmounted before it could ask. Above the screen, every address change
          is one it can hold — and the claim comes from wherever the draft is,
          through `useUnsavedGuard`, so no screen has to know this exists.

          It holds CONTENT, not the URL. The address is allowed to move and the
          browser's own Back and Forward are left alone; what waits is the
          subtree. Refusing a history gesture means rewriting entries underneath
          the reader, and the failure mode of getting that wrong is broken
          navigation for everybody. */}
