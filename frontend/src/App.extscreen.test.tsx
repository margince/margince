// The THIRD extension-route case, beside App.test.tsx's vanilla lane and
// App.composed.test.tsx's descriptor lane: a composed unit that also has a
// bespoke core screen listed in the composed screen registry.
//
// Both aliased modules are swapped, because both are what a composed build
// swaps: "@composition/extensions" is the descriptor registry the route
// resolves against, and "@composition/screens" is the registry it then looks
// the unit's screen up in. The order matters and is what this file pins — the
// screen renders only AFTER the descriptor resolves, so a registry entry for a
// unit the installation did not compose is inert rather than a route into a
// surface with no server behind it.
//
// The screen itself is a stub. The real one (src/screens/ext/notes.tsx) is
// outside the vanilla TypeScript program and is exercised by its own suite;
// what is under test here is App.tsx's dispatch, and mounting the real screen
// would drag its six network calls into a routing test.
