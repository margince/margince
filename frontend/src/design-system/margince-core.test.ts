// value in the stylesheet is mixed from those three. That is what these cases
// hold: a state changes exactly the triple, the triple is built from tokens, and
// the vocabulary the stylesheet paints is the same one the motion table moves.
//
// State carrying colour is the design here rather than a drift, and the guard
// that matters is the other direction: colour may not REPLACE motion. Two states
// that differ only in hue are two states a reader cannot tell apart in a
// screenshot, cannot tell apart at 34px, and cannot tell apart at all if they are
// colour-blind — so every state owns a distinct movement, asserted below off the
// motion table rather than off a list written by hand.
//
// Derived from the stylesheet, so a state added later is covered without being
// added to a fixture: the assertions are about every `[data-core-state]` rule the
// file contains, whatever they turn out to be.
