/**
 * WDS-CORE-2 says the state vocabulary is closed. A catalog showing three of
 * the five is how a closed vocabulary quietly becomes an open one, so every
 * state gets a story, including the two nobody demos: `warning` and `error`,
 * the states a reviewer never asks to see and a user meets on a bad day.
 *
 * **The vocabulary is the agent's work lifecycle**, in order: idle → ingest →
 * working, and back to idle when a run settles, plus the two ways it stops.
 * There is no `listening`: Margince's agent works overnight over captured
 * activity and stages proposals a human confirms — it never holds a
 * conversation, and a state naming one would be the product claiming
 * something it does not do.
 *
 * **State is motion first and colour second.** Each state owns one distinct
 * `level` / `speed` / `pulse` / `ingest` signature (`margince-core-motion.ts`),
 * driven straight into the shader, before it owns a colour triple
 * (`margince-core.css`). Two consequences worth knowing before reading the five:
 *
 *  - A still frame is not the story. `ingest` and `working` sit in
 *    neighbouring greens and are told apart by how the ribbons move: one turns
 *    material inward, the other runs hot and fast. `margince-core-motion.test.ts`
 *    pins the signature, which is where a movement can be asserted instead of
 *    eyeballed.
 *  - The condition a user acts on is never the orb. Every surface that shows a
 *    Core also states its condition in words beside it, which is what makes the
 *    orb safe to be `aria-hidden`.
 *
 * `Ladder` at the end of this file shows all five at once, which is the view that
 * catches two states having drifted into looking alike.
