/**
 * The Core's shading, as GLSL.
 *
 * Kept in its own file for one reason: it is a foreign language. The engine
 * beside it (`margince-core-engine.ts`) is TypeScript about lifecycle, sizing
 * and easing, and reading it should not mean scrolling past three hundred lines
 * of another grammar.
 *
 * WHAT THE OBJECT IS. Four ribbons on their own shells inside a glass ball, all
 * threaded through one shared focus, which is why they cross at a single hot
 * point. Every ribbon is drawn as a SURFACE, hit analytically where the ray
 * crosses its shell, not marched as a volume: near the silhouette a ray runs
 * almost parallel to the surface, and integrating along it smears every edge.
 * That single choice is the whole difference between crisp ribbons and a cloud.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, and was in the study this is ported from: no page
 * background (the Core is a component and has to sit on whatever surface hosts
 * it, so it composites with alpha), and no second palette. The study carried a
 * Siri dress to argue against; the product has one.
