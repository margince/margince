// "Give this a name, then save it" — the one dialog for a write whose only input
// is a name the reader chooses.
//
// It owns three things and delegates the rest: the name, the rule that an empty
// name cannot be saved, and clearing the box on success. The chrome — heading,
// Cancel/Confirm pair, the in-flight and refused readings, the error's live
// region — is ConfirmModal's, which is what keeps this from becoming a second
// dialog. It exists because that composition was hand-rolled with a raw `Modal`
// in the saved-view action, and a second surface needing the same question would
// have hand-rolled it again slightly differently.
//
// The name is NOT held for the caller between openings: a dialog that reopens
// carrying the last name typed offers to save something under a name the reader
// has already used, which on a create surface is how a duplicate gets made.
