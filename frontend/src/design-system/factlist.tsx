// It exists because ten sheets already style the same `<dl> > div > dt + dd`
// shape, and two sites style none at all — `contact360.tsx` applies a
// `.fact-list` class no stylesheet has ever declared, so those rows render with
// the browser's 40px `dd` indent and no alignment at all. A primitive that
// nobody can forget to style is the fix; a eleventh sheet would not be.

 * text: an evidence mark, a record link, a status pill, a monospace amount.
 * Formatting stays at the call site, where the locale is.

 * a row must be shown as unknown, the caller passes the honest words as
 * `value`.
 *
 * `numeric` sets tabular figures on every value, for the case the workbench
 * runtime rows already handle by hand: a column of counts that would otherwise
