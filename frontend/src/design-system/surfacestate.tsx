/**
 * SectionState is what a surface actually knows, and the four base cases are
 * deliberately not collapsed:
 *
 *   ready       — the section came back with rows.
 *   empty       — the section came back, and there are none. A FACT.
 *   withheld    — the caller's role cannot read it; the payload says so.
 *   unavailable — the section is missing and nobody said why: the read
 *                 failed, or the server sent a payload this client does not
 *                 fully understand.
 *
 * empty is the only one that may say "there is none", because it is the only
 * one that knows. Rendering the other three as empty states a fact the page
 * does not have — the reader sees "no open deals" and stops looking.
 *
 * The §7 matrix adds four more, each of which would otherwise be drawn as one
 * of the above and lose what makes it different:
 *
 *   unsupported — this MODE cannot serve the section (an overlay-only
 *                 installation and a native composite section). Distinct from
 *                 unavailable: nothing is broken and retrying changes nothing.
 *   failed      — the read failed and can be retried. `onRetry` is what makes
 *                 it a different state from unavailable rather than a
 *                 differently-worded one.
 *   stale       — the last known value, with when it was last true. It is
 *                 shown rather than withheld, because a figure from this
 *                 morning beats a blank, but never without its `as of`.
 *   partial     — some of the rows, with the count that is missing and a way
 *                 to the full list. Never a silent truncation.
