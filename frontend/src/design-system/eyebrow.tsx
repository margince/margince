import type { ReactNode } from "react";

// The micro-label that sits above the thing it names; its type rule is defined
// on the `.t-eyebrow` role hook. It was spelled out five times across three
// stylesheets — .co-part-label, .co-brief-section-label, .co-timeline-day-heading,
// .code-label and `.firmo dt` — and no two of them agreed. Every one looked
// right on its own.
//
// It ships as BOTH a class and a component, and that is deliberate rather than
// indecision. The declarations live exactly once, in base.css beside
// .t-label and .t-caption, because two of the five sites are reached only by a
// selector — `.firmo dt` names a <dt> the caller never writes a class on, and a
// component cannot help there. This component is the other half: a TSX caller
// that would otherwise retype the class name gets the element choice as a prop
// instead, which is the part that actually varies.
//
// The element varies because the same look does two different jobs. Over a
// section it is a real heading and owes the document an <h3>; beside a value in
// a definition list it is a label and a heading there would invent structure a
// screen reader then has to read past. Nothing about the type says which one it
// is, so the caller does.
