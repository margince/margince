 * state to the next. What it looks like is the shader's business
 * (`margince-core-shader.ts`), and the numbers each state is made of are the
 * table's (`margince-core-motion.ts`).
 *
 * Three rules hold this file together.
 *
 * **Nothing snaps.** Every dial eases toward the current state's target, so a
 * state change reads as the material changing rather than a switch being thrown.
 * The phase is INTEGRATED rather than derived from elapsed time, which is what
 * lets `speed` change without the motion teleporting.
 *
 * **The loop parks whenever nobody is watching, and only ever resumes on an
 * EVENT.** A window without focus, a state that has finished easing and is not
 * advancing, a document hidden behind another tab: in each case the frames are
 * work with nothing to show for it. The condition a loop parks on must have an
 * announced end, or the sphere freezes for good.
 *
 * **It survives the machine.** No WebGL2, a refused compile, a context lost to
 * a GPU reset: the hook reports that it is not live and the component wears its
 * static dress instead.
