/**
 * The trail that says where the reader is and how they got here.
 *
 * Its one caller in this product is the TOP BAR (app/topbar.tsx), not the page
 * head: the trail is chrome that says where the session is, and the page's own
 * name is a heading in the content column below it. The frames here render the
 * primitive on its own ground at `layout: "padded"`, because what they are about
 * is the rules rather than the strip — the strip itself is framed under
 * Shell/Top bar, where the trail can be seen shrinking against a real track edge.
 *
 * What they catch, in order: a single-stop trail is a real state and not a
 * degenerate one (TopLevelPage), the two-stop list→record shape is the one the
 * bar draws on a record route (ListToRecord), only the LAST stop gives way when
 * the row runs out of room while the ancestors keep their full width
 * (LongRecordName — read the ellipsis, then hover or tab to it for the whole
 * name), a middle stop that is user data is capped so the page keeps the row
 * (LongMiddleStop), and a glyph rides with the label rather than replacing it
 * (WithIcon).
 *
 * Flip the Theme toolbar to check both renderings; every colour is a token.

 * The 420px box is the one hand-set width in this file, and it is here because
 * the pressure IS the story: the trail has to be given less room than it wants
 * before there is anything to look at, and the canvas at any reviewer's window
 * width would not do that reliably. In the product the same bound arrives as a
 * grid track rather than as a wrapper (`minmax(0, 1fr)` on the bar's lead), which
 * is the version Shell/Top bar frames.
