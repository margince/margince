/**
 * One answer out of a few, with every answer READABLE AT REST.
 *
 * It exists because the product had the `Radio` atom and no radio GROUP, so
 * every caller wrapped it by hand — each with its own stack gap, its own idea of
 * whether the question was named at all, and at least one with no `fieldset`,
 * which leaves a screen reader announcing loose radios rather than one question
 * with two answers. The invariant this holds: a set of radios IS a question, so
 * it carries a name and a group, and neither is the caller's to forget.
 *
 * When to reach for this instead of the neighbours, because the difference is
 * about the reader and not about taste:
 *
 *  - **`Select`** hides every option but one behind a click. Right for a long or
 *    boring list — a stage, a currency, a date field. Wrong for a decision the
 *    reader has to weigh, and wrong for a BINARY: a dropdown covering two
 *    choices makes somebody open a menu to find out what the alternative even
 *    was.
 *  - **`SegmentedControl`** shows a closed set at once, in a tab strip, at 12.5px
 *    and bold. Right for short labels that name a view. Wrong the moment an
 *    option is a sentence.
 *  - **`Switch`** is one thing on or off. An either/or where BOTH sides need
 *    naming is not that: "everyone except the people I leave out" has no
 *    off-state a reader could infer.
 *
 * `description` is part of the LABEL, not a sibling — which is deliberate, and
 * the reason `Radio` takes a node: for a tick the words are the other half of
 * the click target, so a help line rendered outside the label is a line the
 * reader cannot click and a screen reader does not read with the option it
 * belongs to. Both go in, and the type carries the hierarchy.
 *
 * Copy never lives here: every word arrives as a prop, translated by the caller.
