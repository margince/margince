 * GROW as tokens wrap (it reads `.input`, which is a single-line height, so the
 * override is load-bearing and a regression is invisible until the second row
 * clips), the token and the date box have to sit on the same baseline as a
 * `TextInput` beside them, and both have to read correctly in dark — every value
 * here is a token, so all of it re-resolves.
