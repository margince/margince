 * does not serve). That is a real state and not an omission, which is why the
 * type says so rather than asking a caller to pass an empty string.
 *
 * `lang` is a BCP 47 tag for a label that is not in the page's language — the
 * same obligation `Select`'s options carry (WCAG 2.2 AA 3.1.2), and the reason
 * a record named in German reads correctly on an English page.

/**
 * The trail that says where the reader is and how they got here.
 *
 * It generalises the two-segment record crumb the page head drew by hand
 * (the shell's own record crumb: the list, a slash, the record's name), which could only ever
 * be those two segments and hard-coded the fact that the second one was the
 * page. Every decision that one made by position is a rule here: the LAST item
 * is the current page and is never a link even when it carries an `href`,
 * because a link to the page you are already on is a control that does nothing;
 * and it is the item that gives way under pressure, because it is user data of
 * unbounded length while the first stop is a nav label of the product's own
 * choosing. A stop between them may be user data too, so it is capped, and it
 * folds away at phone width (breadcrumb.css).
 *
 * Separators are `<span aria-hidden>` INSIDE the list item they lead — never
 * list items of their own, which would make a three-stop trail announce as five
 * things, and never CSS `content`, which some screen readers speak and others
 * do not, so the same page reads differently to two readers.
 *
 * It accepts no `className` or `style`: a primitive owns its chrome, and a
 * trail restyled per screen is how the head and the record page came to draw
 * two different crumbs.
