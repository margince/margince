/**
 * The Margince select: a button trigger plus a portalled listbox popup.
 *
 * It exists because a native `<select>` is the one control the browser draws
 * itself. Its closed face takes our tokens, and everything the user actually
 * chooses from — the option list, its fill, its type, its highlight, its
 * scrollbar — is painted by the platform in the platform's own idiom. On the
 * same screen as the rest of this design system that reads as a hole, and no
 * amount of CSS closes it: `option` is not stylable in any engine we ship to.
 *
 * Two consequences the caller sees, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - `onChange` reports the VALUE, not an event. A listbox has no
 *    `event.target.value`, and threading a synthetic event through would be a
 *    lie about where the value came from.
 *  - `options` is data, not `<option>` children. The component has to know the
 *    labels to render a trigger face, to run typeahead and to skip a disabled
 *    entry from the keyboard; reading that back out of children would be
 *    guesswork.
 *
 * `required` becomes `aria-required` rather than a `required` attribute: a
 * button carries no constraint validation, and neither does the hidden input
 * that mirrors the value into a real `<form>` (the HTML spec exempts hidden
 * inputs from validation). So a required select announces the requirement and
 * the surrounding form still owns refusing an empty submit — which every screen
 * here already does in its own submit handler.
