// reading them as an alternative computation is the mistake the popover exists
// to prevent.

// No fetch and no query: the whole fixture arrives as a prop, so LocaleProvider
// is the only context needed. `workspaceZone` is the zone the rate DATES are
// read in (a reporting-period label, not the viewer's calendar), pinned here the
// way every other date-bearing catalog entry pins it.
//
// The popover is component-local state with no `startOpen` prop, so the open
// stories click the toggle in play(); fe-uat waits longer on a play-fn story
// before it captures.
