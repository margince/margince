/**
 * Whether this window has focus — ONE signal, for the whole document.
 *
 * A window sitting behind another one is not being watched, so the Core holds
 * still there. Two very different consumers need that answer: the WebGL draw
 * loop, which parks, and the stylesheet, which pauses its rhythms off
 * `data-window-blurred` on the root element. Both read the state maintained
 * here, so the sphere and its glow can never disagree about whether the Core is
 * moving — the failure that duplicating the condition per consumer produces.
 *
 * ONE `focus`/`blur` pair for the document however many Cores are mounted, held
 * only while somebody wants it: the listeners arrive with the first consumer and
 * leave with the last, so nothing outlives the last Core — not a listener, and
 * not the attribute.
 *
 * `document.hasFocus()` is read once per attach, to seed the state, and never
 * again. It is deliberately not polled: a poll answers only for the instant it
 * is asked, and a draw loop may park on a condition only if the END of that
 * condition is announced by an event. `focus` is that announcement; asking
 * would be a missed resume and a permanently frozen sphere.
