// a caller may hand it — and the second is the interesting one. A malformed date
// is not refused at runtime by anything: the element sanitizes what it cannot
// read down to "" per the HTML spec, so the value simply disappears with nothing
// said about why. That silence is what the prop type exists to prevent, and both
// halves are asserted below: the type refuses the shapes at compile time, and the
// runtime shows what would otherwise happen.

  // Each of the three below carries two assertions. The `@ts-expect-error` is
  // one: the line fails to compile if the narrowing stops working, because an
  // unneeded expect-error is itself an error (TS2578, and `tsconfig.node.json`
  // includes `src`, so these files are in a typechecked project). The `expect` is
  // the other, and records the cost of getting past the type — the value is gone,
  // and nothing anywhere says so.
  //
  // React stringifies whatever it is given, which is why a ONE-element list is
  // absent here: `["2026-07-18"]` coerces to exactly the right string and works
  // by accident. That is the strongest argument for putting the check in the type
  // — a mistake that sometimes survives is one no runtime gate will find.
