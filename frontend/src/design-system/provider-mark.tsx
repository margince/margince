/*
 * SANCTIONED LITERALS — third-party brand marks.
 *
 * Google's, Microsoft's and LinkedIn's own colours, identifying their sign-in
 * (or connect) providers. These are not design-system colours and must not be
 * tokenised: a provider mark rendered in Ledger Green is a wrong mark, and
 * re-tinting another company's logo is not ours to do. This file is the ONE
 * named exclusion in both colour gates — `scripts/check-ds-purity.sh` and the
 * `keeps literal colours in tokens.css only` case in
 * `design-system/conformance.test.ts` — each carrying that reason.
 *
 * Lucide ships no brand logos, so the marks are inline SVG. They live in the
 * design system rather than in the auth screen because the mailbox-connect step
 * needs the same two (Google, Microsoft) and the network-connect step needs
 * LinkedIn: a second copy of any of these palettes is a second place for the
 * rule above to quietly stop holding.
 *
 * The mark is chosen from the provider's `key`, which is the ONLY part of a
 * provider this frontend decides. The button's label is the installation's own
 * string, served by `/auth/capabilities` — see `ProviderButtons` in
 * `screens/auth.tsx`.
 */

/**
 * The brand word for a key this frontend recognises, or null.
 *
 * Same knowledge as the mark, so it lives beside it: recognising `google` well
 * enough to draw its logo is recognising it well enough to name it. A narrow
 * layout can then show "Google" where the installation's full label
 * ("Continue with Google") does not fit on one line.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately is NOT. It is not a translation — these are proper
 * nouns and stay identical in every locale, the same rule the served label
 * follows (§11.5). And it is not derived from the label by trimming a leading
 * "Continue with": the next installation's label is "Sign in with Okta" or a
 * German sentence, and a trim would mangle both. An unrecognised key returns
 * null, and the caller shows the server's own words — which are the only thing
 * that can be right for a provider this file has never heard of.
