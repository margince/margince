/**
 * The Margince Core — WDS-CORE-1..4 (ADR-0076).
 *
 * The product's one piece of AI identity, shown by the unauthenticated surface,
 * the session splash, onboarding and the workspace rail: a glass ball with four
 * ribbons turning inside it, all threaded through one shared focus, which is
 * why they cross at a single hot point. The ribbons are drawn on the GPU
 * (`margince-core-shader.ts`), moved by the engine beside it, and what each
 * state DOES is one table (`margince-core-motion.ts`).
 *
 * Four things about it are load-bearing rather than stylistic:
 *
 *  - **One implementation** (WDS-CORE-1). A caller passes `state` and never
 *    restyles. Sizing through the documented `--coreSize` / `--coreGlass`
 *    custom properties is configuration; anything past that is a caller
 *    restyling a shared primitive.
 *  - **The state list is closed** (WDS-CORE-2), and it is the AGENT'S WORK
 *    LIFECYCLE: idle → ingest → working, and back to idle when a run settles.
 *    `warning` covers every way the agent stops on something a human must
 *    look at — a contradiction, an unreachable source, a licence it lacks —
 *    and `error` is the one way a run breaks outright. Callers use the Core as
 *    a status channel, and a status channel with an open vocabulary is one
 *    nobody can test and no second caller can reuse. There is no `listening` or
 *    `speaking`: Margince's agent runs overnight over captured activity and
 *    stages proposals a human confirms — it never holds a conversation, and a
 *    state naming one would be the product claiming something it does not do.
 *  - **State is MOTION first**, colour second. One behaviour per state, so the
 *    three that share the palette's indigo (idle, ingest and working) are still
 *    three distinguishable things. Only the two that stop leave the indigo:
 *    amber for `warning`, red for `error`.
 *  - **It is `aria-hidden`** (WDS-CORE-4). Every state it shows is also stated
 *    in text by the surface around it, which is what makes it safe to be this
 *    decorative — and why it carries no click: the caller's own button owns
 *    that.
 *
 * WHAT A HOST WITHOUT WEBGL2 GETS. The static dress below: the same ball, the
 * same state colour, no motion. That is not a courtesy path, it is what jsdom
 * renders in every test, what a locked-down browser renders, and what a context
 * lost to a GPU reset falls back to. `data-core-state` is on the root either
 * way, so a surface reading the Core's state off the DOM cannot tell the
 * difference.
