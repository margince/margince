// The app-level boundary (app/errorboundary.tsx) is the floor, not the whole
// story: it catches the throw, but by then the whole routed shell has unmounted
// and the reader is looking at a single apology where a page used to be — the
// navigation rail included, so the one thing they could have done next (go
// somewhere else) went with it. A page assembled from a dozen independent reads
// has a dozen ways to throw, and every one of them costs the reader the page.
//
// This boundary keeps its own place. The card that failed says so and offers a
// retry; the eleven beside it, and the rail, never learn anything happened.
//
// It never shows the thrown error's text, for the same reason the app-level one
// does not: a render throw is a defect in this app, not a message from the
// server. Its text names our internals, the reader cannot act on it, and a
// stack trace on a settings page is the app leaking rather than explaining.
