// subtree on what the address is ABOUT (app/router.tsx's routeIdentity) so that
// moving between views is a re-render rather than a remount. What that buys is
// visible: the record's header, its readings and the tab strip the reader just
// clicked keep their DOM nodes, so design-system/enter.css plays the arrival
// animation for the panel that actually changed and for nothing else.
//
// It is asserted here rather than in screens/personpage.test.tsx because the key
// lives above every screen: that suite mounts the page with a `tab` prop and can
// never see the router decide.
