 * A draft survives the reader leaving the page it is on.
 *
 * Asserted end to end because the thing under test is where the guard SITS. It
 * is rendered above the routed screen (App.tsx), and the reason is only visible
 * across a whole navigation: a guard installed inside the settings screen
 * unmounted with that screen, so it caught a move from one settings entry to the
 * next and lost the draft without a word the moment the reader clicked anything
 * in the sidebar. A unit test of the guard cannot tell those two arrangements
 * apart — both hold content when the address changes — so the proof has to be a
 * real route change in a real shell.
