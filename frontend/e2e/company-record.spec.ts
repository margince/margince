 * The company record page against the design's glance (DESIGN.md §7).

 * This suite exists because "it looks like the mockup" kept being reported from
 * reading the code rather than the page. TWO describes, and the split matters:
 *
 *   - page shape — which regions exist and in what order;
 *   - visual weight — how big and how prominent they are.
 *
 * Shape alone is not the requirement, and asserting only shape is how a page
 * with the right skeleton at half the mockup's scale passed every check while
 * looking nothing like it. The second describe reads computed styles.
 *
 * Never pixel-equality and never the drawn English strings: the app renders
 * German chrome, so a copy change must not fail a layout suite, and a font
 * substitution must not fail a scale one. The visual assertions are FLOORS —
 * they say "at least this prominent", which is the claim the mockup makes.
 *
 * It runs against a LIVE stack (BASE_URL + a real company id), because the two
 * states that have to look right — a populated account and a freshly imported
 * one — are data states, not mock fixtures. Without BASE_URL the whole suite
 * skips itself loudly rather than passing on an app it never loaded.
