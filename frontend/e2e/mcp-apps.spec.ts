// The MCP App views, driven in a real browser, asserting the one property no
// static analysis can reach: the built document makes NO network request.
//
// WHY THIS LANE EXISTS. The api's admission check is a substring ratchet and its
// own comments admit computed properties and aliases bypass it — `node['inner' +
// 'HTML']`, `window[fetchName](url)`. The build-time parsed validator judges the
// document's nodes, which is stronger, but neither can see a request that is
// only assembled at run time. A browser can.
//
// OBSERVED AT CONTEXT LEVEL, with service workers blocked. Page-level routing
// misses service-worker-handled traffic, popups and workers, which is precisely
// where a computed sink would hide.
//
// FIVE STATES, not one happy fixture. A document that fetches nothing while
// rendering a populated list may still fetch something on the empty state, on a
// warning, on a malformed payload, or when the host changes the theme.
