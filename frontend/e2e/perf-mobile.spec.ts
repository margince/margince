/**
 * MOBILE-AC-2: record open p95 < 300 ms perceived, on a throttled Fast-3G
 * profile at 390px. The BUDGET is PERF-1's and is single-homed there;
 * MOBILE-PARAM-2 pins only the condition it has to hold under.
 *
 * This is the ONLY place PERF-1's perceived budget is asserted. The acceptance
 * lane keeps the structural claim — the head renders from the route, not from
 * the read — and no number, because one wall-clock sample on a runner shared
 * with six integration shards measures the machine. Throttled p95 is the harder
 * condition: a budget that holds on Fast-3G holds on a fast link by
 * construction, so an unthrottled copy would add a second answer, not a second
 * question.
 *
 * Run it with `make bench-mobile`. It is not collected by `pnpm e2e`.
