// The frontend suite's time budget, derived rather than picked.
//
// Six screen suites failed intermittently with `Test timed out in 5000ms` —
// vitest's default `testTimeout`, which nothing overrode. They passed in
// isolation and failed when the machine was busy, so the same commit produced a
// different verdict run to run (#1144).
//
// It is NOT starvation, and it is not vague slowness either. Measured under
// deliberate load (8 spin loops on 10 cores) with the timeout lifted, the two
// tests observed failing completed in 609ms and 910ms, and the slowest test in
// the whole suite took 3437ms. Nothing is stuck, and nothing is close to five
// seconds of work.
//
// What is actually wrong is arithmetic between two budgets that were never
// compared. Testing Library's `asyncUtilTimeout` and `vi.waitFor`'s timeout both
// default to one second, and this repo overrides neither — so a test built from
// N sequential waits may legitimately spend N seconds waiting without any single
// wait failing. `company-act.test.tsx`'s "re-arms Continue once a skew refetch
// actually lands a NEW hash" chains six of them. Against a five-second ceiling
// that test can fail while every assertion in it is passing, and the failure
// names the test rather than the wait that was slow.
//
// The repo had already found this once and written it down — in
// src/screens/company-context.test.tsx, which pins its own
// `TEST_MS = SETTLE_MS * 4` with the reason spelled out: "it must cover EVERY
// waiter in there: four run in sequence, each bounded by SETTLE_MS. A test whose
// own limit is smaller than the sum lets vitest fire while a waiter still has
// budget, and what surfaces then is an opaque timeout rather than the assertion
// the test was written to make." That is this defect exactly, fixed for one
// file. #1144 is the same arithmetic everywhere it was not fixed, so the ceiling
// belongs here, once, rather than as a per-file constant six more suites would
// have to remember to copy.
//
// That file keeps its own numbers and is deliberately untouched: it overrides
// the per-waiter budget as well as the per-test one, and the defect it is still
// carrying (issue 613) is starvation rather than arithmetic. Its two starved
// cases are exempted by name in scripts/test-budget.test.ts so they stay
// fast-red.
//
// Two of its OTHER cases state no ceiling of their own, so they sit in the
// population this ceiling is measured over and are what set its width at
// 10000ms. That is a real cost and it is recorded rather than smoothed over:
// the whole suite's ceiling is being driven by one file's local waiter
// override, and until issue 613 is settled and that file can be edited, the
// right fix — giving those two cases their own ceiling, as
// integrations-provider.test.tsx does — is not available. Issue 1717 carries
// it. Do not read the ceiling below as "smaller than anything company-context
// waits for": it is larger, and what keeps issue 613 fast-red is the exemption,
// not this number.
//
// So the ceiling has to clear the longest chain the suite legitimately composes,
// plus the render and act work sitting between those waits.

 * A test that deliberately raises its OWN waiters above the default — a slow
