  // alone. Registered here rather than per file because the leak belongs to
  // every suite that renders a list, including the ones nobody has written yet.

  // jsdom environment is torn down. React's scheduler then wakes on a
  // `setImmediate` into a world with no `window` and throws there, which vitest

  // `afterEach` before this one, and unmounting an unmounted tree is a no-op.
