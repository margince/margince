// The notepad's rows are the unit's, so nothing in the core can describe a
// write to them — no entity type, no field images, no verb. This file is where
// the unit says those things, and the core supplies everything a unit must not
// choose: the actor, the workspace, the attribution and the trace.

// SQL calls it. Both, because they are two different names for one thing:

// statement resolves through a search_path the ext schema is not on. Deriving
// one from the other keeps them from drifting apart.
