// Package notes is the tier's REFERENCE extension: one first-party unit that
// exercises every capability an extension can hold, so PR1's acceptance is a
// human driving the SPA rather than a green test suite. It ships enabled in the
// vanilla tree alongside de and yogi — a demo nobody runs is not a demo.
//
// The six surfaces, and the one screen (#/ext/notes, "Demo Notepad") that
// makes each of them visible:
//
//   - migrations/ — ext_notes_note, workspace-scoped under forced RLS. Add a
//     note, restart the stack, it is still there.
//   - api/ — seven governed operations under /ext/notes/, gating on three RBAC
//     objects of the unit's own. A read-only seat sees the list and no Add
//     control; ext_notes_filing is the one no seeded role holds, because
//     filing writes a record the whole product shares.
//   - secrets — a stored HMAC signing key, proven by USE. Signing a payload is
//     the whole demonstration; no operation returns the key, masked or
//     otherwise, because the production shape this stands in for (a webhook
//     signature, a request signature) never needs one to.
//   - Jobs — a heartbeat tick that writes one row naming its own workspace. It
//     is the only thing on the screen that happens without a user, and naming
//     the workspace is what makes the dispatcher's FAN-OUT visible rather than
//     silently demonstrating the single-tenant case.
//   - Tools — the same seven operations reach the agent as governed tools;
//     list_notes is the one an operator asks "what's in my demo notepad".
//   - the screen — served from the CORE frontend tree, not from this unit.
//     extensions/<name>/frontend/ is still an unbuilt capability layer that
//     gen-composition refuses on sight, and lifting it means bundling
//     unit-authored TSX into the SPA — a supply-chain decision with its own
//     reviewed slice. See frontend/src/screens/ext/notes.tsx.
//
// NOTHING about this unit's GOVERNANCE is repeated in Go. api/crm.yaml holds
// every operation's tier, scope, RBAC object, prose and schemas; api/jobs.yaml
// holds the job's cadence, wall clocks, queue and attempt cap. These files hold
// the one thing a static document cannot: the functions.
