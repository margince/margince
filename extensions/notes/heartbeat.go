// The scheduled tick: the only thing on the demo screen that happens without a

// the attempt cap; this is the whole of the behavior.

// heartbeat writes one row naming the workspace this tick is for, and prunes
// its own history to the newest keptHeartbeats.
//
// Naming the workspace is the point of the row, not decoration. A scheduled
// extension job is a FAN-OUT: the cadenced dispatcher enqueues one workspace
// child per live tenant, and on a single-workspace dev install that is one
// child. A row naming no tenant would demonstrate the single-tenant case and
// leave the multi-tenant guarantee untested, so the tenant the runner pinned is
// written into the row a human reads.
//
// THERE IS NO TICK NUMBER, and its absence is a correction. The row used to
// carry `tick #N` counted as `count(*) + 1` over surviving rows — which, with
// the prune holding the population at keptHeartbeats, meant the counter climbed
// to 11 and then every subsequent tick wrote the identical string. The comment
// here described "renumbering from the oldest kept tick"; nothing renumbered,
// it simply saturated, and consecutive rows read the same. Raising the kept
// count only moves the ceiling.
//
// created_at carries the sequence instead. The screen already renders it in
// front of every row, so an ordering the database maintains is displayed rather
// than a counter this unit would have to maintain — and a monotonic counter
// would need a sequence the unit has no reason to own.
//
// THE PRUNE IS NOT HOUSEKEEPING. At a 60s cadence this writes 1,440 rows per
// workspace per day, forever, into the same table the screen reads with
// LIMIT 200 — so after about 3.3 hours of uptime every note a human typed is
// below the read window, and "add a note, restart the stack, it is still
// there" stops being observable. The demo would crowd itself off its own
// screen, and the acceptance step that proves the migrations layer works would
// fail for a reason that has nothing to do with migrations.
//
// Pruning was chosen over filtering the ticks out of the notes read, because
// the tick is meant to be SEEN in the list — it is the one row that appears
// with no user action, and moving it to a separate strip would make the jobs
// surface something a viewer has to be told about rather than something they
// watch happen. A bounded history keeps both properties, and it also bounds
// the table, which a filtered read would not.
//
// THE TICK RECORDS NOTHING, and it is the one write in this unit that does not.
// Every other own-table write goes through recordNote — a ledger row and an
// event — because each is a fact somebody may later ask about: who added this
// note, who filed it, who took the filing away. A tick is none of those. It
// writes a row nobody asked for, at a cadence, and prunes it again minutes
// later; recording it would put 1,440 immutable audit rows per workspace per
// day into a table nothing prunes, to say that a demonstration ran. The history
// of the demo would outlive, and outnumber, the history of what the demo is
// for.
//
// The exemption is about CADENCE and about what the row means, not about
// convenience. A unit whose unattended pass writes something a person could be
// asked about later should record it, and the withdrawal handler beside this
// one does exactly that, under the same no-caller conditions. `tx.Record` is
// offered rather than enforced (extension.Tx), and this is what declining it
// looks like when the choice is deliberate.
//
// An error fails the attempt, which the dispatcher's next tick retries. There
// is no result — nobody is waiting for one.

		// matched on the body's leading glyph, which meant a note a person
		// typed starting with the same characters was counted as a tick and
		// then DELETED by the prune below. Neither statement carries a tenant
		// predicate, and neither needs one: the table holds one installation's
		// rows and nothing else.
		//
		// The author columns are LEFT OUT rather than written as anything, and
		// that is the whole handling of the no-author case on this side: a tick
		// has no person behind it (rt.Caller() here is the zero Caller —

		// this row, and naming them with a zero uuid would invent a user that
		// does not exist. Omitting them satisfies the both-or-neither CHECK by
		// taking the "neither" branch, and the read renders no `author` at all.
