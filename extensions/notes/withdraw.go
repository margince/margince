// withdrawFiling clears a note's filing when the activity it was filed to is
// archived.
//
// WHY THIS IS AN OBLIGATION RATHER THAN A DEMONSTRATION. file_note writes two
// rows: this unit's note, and a core activity on the record's timeline. The
// note keeps the activity's id, which is what lets the screen say a note
// reached a record. Archiving that activity takes the timeline entry away — and
// leaves the note claiming a filing whose entry nobody can see. Nothing in the
// core knows this unit's column exists, so if the unit does not listen, the
// claim stays wrong forever.
//
// NOBODY IS BEHIND THIS CALL. rt.Caller() is the zero Caller and the core port
// is shut, which is exactly right for the work: the row this touches is the
// unit's own, and the archive that triggered it was already authorized by
// whoever made it.
//
// IT IS SAFE TO RUN TWICE, which the bus requires: the UPDATE matches on the
// filing that is being withdrawn, so a redelivery matches nothing, writes no
// ledger row and publishes nothing. An audit trail of writes that did not
// happen would be worse than no trail at all.
