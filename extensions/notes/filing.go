// filingSource is what the activity's provenance says about where it came from.
//
// The contract leaves `source` free-form except for the reserved `mirror:`
// namespace, and the value matters to a human reading a timeline: it is the
// only place the row says a unit filed it rather than a person typing into the
// activity screen. The AUDIT row carries the same fact structurally (the core
// stamps evidence.extension from the invocation); this is the copy the timeline
// itself can show.
const filingSource = "extension:notes"

// fileNote writes one note AND files it to a record: the unit's own row and a
// core activity against the subject the caller names, in one transaction.
//
// This is what the governed port is for, and the shape is the point rather than
// the feature. Everything about the activity — that the caller was allowed to
// create one, that the subject exists and is theirs to see, the audit row, the
// outbox event, the captured_by stamp — belongs to the core write the port
// delegates to. What this unit contributes is its own row and the decision to
// pair them.
//
// The pairing is atomic in both directions, which is why the activity is
// created FIRST: the note's receipt column can then be written in the insert
// that creates it, so there is no window where a note exists without its
// receipt. If the note's own insert fails afterwards, the transaction takes the
// activity with it — a filed note that lost its note would be a timeline entry
// nobody can trace back.
