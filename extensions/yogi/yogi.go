// Package yogi is a first-party reference extension shipping one governed
// agent tool: yogi_quote returns a random Yogi Berra quote. It exercises
// the whole served-tool path — the contract fragment that DECLARES the tool
// (api/crm.yaml: its route, risk tier, Passport scope, prose and schemas), the
// manifest derived from that declaration, and boot registration into the same
// MCP registry and admission gate the core tools ride. The tool is read-only
// with no arguments, so the contract requests the 🟢 auto-execute tier and the
// read scope: nothing to confirm, nothing to mutate.
//
// Nothing about the tool's GOVERNANCE is repeated here. This file holds the
// verb and the function; api/crm.yaml holds everything a reader, a client or an
// operator needs, and gen-composition merges it into the effective contract.
