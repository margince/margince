// extension — the ADR-0069 migration pilot: the first first-party unit
// shipping enabled-by-default in the vanilla tree (its directory under
// extensions/ IS the enablement). V1 ships the GoBD statutory retention
// classes; further obligations (the XRechnung/ZUGFeRD fiscal formats,
// the CRA conformity regime) return to the seam when their work packages
// land. Core code never contains a jurisdiction string — this unit is
// where Germany lives. The legal position behind the product's German and
// European compliance posture, including why no scraping-based enrichment
// ships, is docs/explanation/data-enrichment-position.md.

// commercial correspondence 6), each ANCHORED at calendar-year end —
// §147(4) AO starts every period at the end of the calendar year the
// record occurred in, so a January Handelsbrief keeps almost seven
// calendar years. The core engine treats these as FLOORS — a workspace
// policy may keep longer, never destroy earlier. The spans are calendar
// years (ISO 8601 periods), never day counts. Bücher/Abschlüsse (10 yr)
// are deliberately absent: a CRM holds no books or annual accounts, and
// a floor no record can carry would be documentation posing as
// enforcement.
