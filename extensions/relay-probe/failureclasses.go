// This unit's failure vocabulary: one entry for every way its poll can fail that
// an operator would act on DIFFERENTLY.
//
// WHY THE SENTENCES LIVE HERE rather than being composed from the cause: a job
// failure reaches an admin through river_job.errors, a column with no workspace
// and so no RLS, which every workspace's admin reads. A provider refusing a
// message routinely names the account or the address it refused, so the job layer
// persists nothing but a sentence from a closed vocabulary — and until this unit
// declared one, a tick that had already worked out which member was broken and
// why could report only that its failure was unclassifiable.
//
// Every string below is one this unit WROTE. Nothing the provider said can reach
// that column through this file, because nothing the provider said is in it.
//
// THE PER-CONNECTION TOKENS ARE ALSO last_error_class on the connection row (see
// noteFailure), and that is deliberate: the Relay screen and the Maintenance
// screen describe the same outage, and an operator comparing them must read one
// fact rather than two vocabularies.
//
// WHAT THIS UNIT CAN AND CANNOT DISTINGUISH is narrower than it looks, and the
// list is short for a reason rather than by omission. It reaches ONE provider
// over one token per member, so it has no package tier to lapse and no developer
// app registration to be missing — the classes those would earn do not exist
// here. What it has instead is a FLEET: many members polled in one tick, each
// failing on their own, which is where classEveryMemberFailed comes from — a
// unit polling a single account on one workspace-wide credential has no use for
// that class and should not copy it.

		Remedy:   "That member reconnects Relay from their own Connections page and pastes a current token; nobody can deposit one on their behalf.",
	}
	// classProviderUnavailable is the outage that needs NO intervention, and
	// saying so is the point: no cursor moved, so the next tick walks the same
	// region and no message is lost. It is also the class a base URL that does not
	// resolve from this installation lands in, which is the most common way this
	// connector fails and the one nobody should be repairing a token over.

		Class:    "provider_unavailable",

		Remedy:   "Nothing to do: the poll catches up by itself and no message is lost. If every tick fails, check this installation's network reach and DNS for the connection's base URL.",

		Remedy:   "The answer is in the process log. A provider whose format changed needs a change to this connector, so report it rather than reconfiguring anything.",

	// stops their poll without anything about Relay changing.
	classMemberNotPermitted = extension.FailureClass{
		Class:    "member_not_permitted",
		Sentence: "the member this poll acted for may no longer capture what it lands",
		Remedy:   "Restore that member's role, or disconnect their Relay connection if they are not meant to capture into the CRM any more.",

	// classConnectionUnusable is the core refusing what this unit handed it as

	// state no poll can repair.
	classConnectionUnusable = extension.FailureClass{
		Class:    "connection_unusable",
		Sentence: "this connection was refused as unusable, so the poll had nothing valid to act on",
		Remedy:   "The member disconnects Relay and connects it again: a poll cannot repair the connection record it was handed, and the refused value is in the process log.",
	}
	// classPollFailed is the catch-all, and it is honest about being one. Its

		Class:    "poll_failed",
		Sentence: "the Relay poll failed for a cause this connector does not yet classify",
		Remedy:   "Read the cause in this job's process log. A failure that keeps landing here is one this connector owes a name, so report it with that line.",

	//
	// It is reported ONLY when every connection failed AND they did not fail the
	// same way. Every member failing identically is not a fleet condition needing
	// its own name — it is that one condition, happening everywhere, and reporting
	// the shared class is what turns a screenful of dead jobs into a sentence
	// naming the thing to go fix (see fleetFailure). Members failing for DIFFERENT
	// reasons is the genuinely different situation: nothing is common to them, so
	// there is no single outage to chase and the class must not imply there is.
	//
	// Unlike every class above it, this token lands on NO connection row: each row
	// carries its own member's class, which is the more specific truth. What this
	// class describes is the tick, and the tick has no row.
