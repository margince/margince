// conversation the poll captured (ADR-0107/A158, DESIGN-SP5 §9).
//
// Whose credential transmits is the whole shape of this file. A message leaves
// under the MEMBER's own token — the person who staged it — never under an
// installation credential, because this provider has none: the unit holds one
// sealed secret per member and nothing else. That is also why Live exists: the
// core has to be able to ask "can this member still send" without spending the
// credential to find out.
