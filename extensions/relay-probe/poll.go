// The scheduled poll: the only thing here that happens without a user, and the
// reason this unit exists.
//
// THE SHAPE TO HOLD ONTO is that a tick reads its work in one transaction,
// closes it, and only then ingests. Runtime.Ingest hands a record to the core's
// capture pipeline, which opens its own transaction — so calling it inside one
// of this unit's would take a second connection while holding one, which on a
// small pool does not fail, it hangs. The core refuses that (ErrNestedIngest)
// rather than letting it happen, and this file is what obeying the rule looks
// like: read, close, ingest, then open a second transaction to move the cursor.
//
// The cursor moves AFTER the ingest and never before it — that asymmetry is the
// whole safety argument. A cursor not advanced past a record that landed costs
// one deduplicated retry, because the natural key makes a replay a no-op; a
// cursor advanced past a record that did not land costs the record.
