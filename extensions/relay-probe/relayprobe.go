// Package relayprobe is the ingress seam's consumer: a unit that pulls each
// connected member's Relay inbox and lands what they were directed at on the
// CRM timeline, through the same capture pipeline a mailbox goes through.
//
// WHAT THIS UNIT IS NOT. The product's Relay integration — cross-linking a
// deal or a person to a conversation, both directions resolving from one stored
// row, riding the shared event bus — is CORE interop and is untouched by
// anything here. This unit owns no link, writes no conversation_link, and
// consumes no bus. It is the INBOUND half of a channel, built on the extension
// tier: a member deposits their own token, a scheduled poll reads their
// directed messages, and each one becomes an ordinary captured activity.
//
// Which file demonstrates what:
//
//   - migrations/ — ext_relay_probe_connection, one row per connected
//     member, workspace-scoped under forced RLS. It holds the cursor and the
//     status; it deliberately does NOT hold the token.
//   - connection.go — connect / status / disconnect, gating on one RBAC object
//     of the unit's own, which no seeded role holds. Connect binds the token to
//     the CALLER's own user id, taken from the invocation and never from the
//     body: otherwise any holder of that object could deposit a credential for
//     a colleague, and the consent the ingress port checks would be forgeable
//     through this unit's own surface.
//   - secrets — the member's personal access token, at user scope, read back
//     only by the poll that acts for that member. No operation returns it,
//     masked or otherwise.
//   - poll.go — the scheduled job, and the whole reason the unit exists:
//     Runtime.Ingest, called with none of this unit's transactions open,
//     followed by a cursor advance that is a separate commit. The cursor rule
//     lives there and is the part most worth reading.
//   - ledger.go — every state change on the connection row records a ledger row
//     and an event, because a connection appearing, moving or breaking is a
//     fact somebody may later ask about.
//
// NOTHING about this unit's GOVERNANCE is repeated in Go: api/crm.yaml holds
// each operation's tier, scope, RBAC object, prose and schemas, api/jobs.yaml
// holds the cadence and the wall clocks, and the ingress declaration below is
// what an operator reads to see that this unit reaches core capture at all.
