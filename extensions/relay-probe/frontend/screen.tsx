// supply-chain decision the tier already made for extensions/notes: unit-authored
// TSX is compiled into the SPA bundle, guarded by collectUnitFrontend (private
// package, correct name, react and react-query as PEERS so the host's single
// copy runs) and by check-ext-imports.sh (the core reachable only through the
// exports map).
//
// WHAT THE SCREEN DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SHOW: the token. No operation returns
// it, masked or otherwise, and there is nothing here that asks. What a stored
// credential can honestly produce is exactly what is rendered — that a
// connection exists, how far it has read, when it last ran, and whether the
// provider still accepts it.
//
// Everything is about the CALLER's own connection. The operations take no
// member argument at all, so there is no version of this screen that shows a
// colleague's inbox position.
