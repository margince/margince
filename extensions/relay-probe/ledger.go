// other listeners hear.
//
// EVERY state change on a connection is recorded — it appears, it moves, it
// breaks, it goes — because each is a fact somebody may later ask about: who
// connected this member's account, when the cursor last moved, when the token
// stopped working. The one write that is NOT recorded is the poll's
// last_polled_at touch on an otherwise unchanged row, and that exemption is
// stated where it is taken (poll.go), not here.
