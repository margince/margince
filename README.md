# Margince

**A CRM your AI agents can actually work in. And it's yours: you get
the source.**

CRMs got stuck. You pay per seat, per contact, per feature. You can't
change anything without consultants. And the "AI" is a sidebar that
summarizes what you typed in yourself.

We hit that wall ourselves, so we're building Margince: a fast,
opinionated core for the 80% every sales team needs, plus a governed
agent surface so the AI you already pay for (Claude, Copilot, your own)
works inside your customer data, not next to it.

Three things matter:

**Your agents do the real work.** An agent connects over MCP or plain
REST and gets audited tools. Every action has a risk tier. 🟢 actions
(reading, drafting, normal updates) just run and get logged. 🟡 actions
(sending mail, archiving, merging, closing a deal) stop and wait for a
human to approve them. An agent never gets more rights than the human
behind it, and it can never approve its own actions. Punkt.

**You change it by changing the code.** No config screens, no metadata
engine, no ceiling. Need a custom field or a workflow? That's a normal
code change in your own copy, protected by types, tests, and extension
seams upstream never touches. Made by you, by a partner, or by us.

**It runs where you want.** SaaS, your own servers, or fully local
including the LLM, for teams whose data can't leave the building.
Sub-100ms interactions is the budget, not the marketing line.

our own HubSpot with it first. If it can't carry our pipeline, it
doesn't ship

## This repository

This is where Margince is built: the running Go code, the OpenAPI
contract it is generated from, the tests that prove its behaviour, and
the documentation for building and operating it. There is no separate
specification that outranks what is here — `backend/api/crm.yaml` is the
contract and the tests are the record of behaviour.

**Start here:**

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the gates, DCO sign-off, and AI-disclosure rules.
- **[docs/explanation/backend-onboarding.md](docs/explanation/backend-onboarding.md)** — the backend
  contributor hub: the codebase map, reading order, and how to add a feature.
- **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — the full documentation index (tutorials, how-to, reference,
  explanation).

Everything below this line is for people (and agents) working on the code.

## Quick start

**Boot it.** `make dev` brings up the whole local stack — the Docker
Compose infra (Postgres 16 + Redis 7), migrations, the api, and the Vite SPA
— then prints the URLs and returns (the servers run in the background; stop
them with `make dev-stop`):

```sh
make dev
```

It boots **cold**: the organization and admin seat the api bootstraps from
`config/margince.yaml`, and no other data. That is the state a real first
customer sees, so onboarding and empty states are what you develop against
by default.

**Log in.** Open **http://localhost:8080** — that is the app, always. The
dev server proxies `/v1` (and the probes) to the api behind it on :18080, so
the one port serves both the UI and the contract. Sign in as
`admin@demo.test`. Which password depends on whether you have seeded:

- **After `make seed-dev`** — `demo-password-123`. That is the password the
  seed **chose**, not one from a config file.
- **Straight after `make dev`, unseeded** — `operator-supplied-first-password`,
  from `config/margince-admin-password`. The app will immediately ask you to
  replace it, and nothing else is reachable until you do.

The difference is the product working as intended: a configured bootstrap has
the *operator* pick the first admin's password, and that account reaches
nothing but the change-password screen until the person using it picks their
own. `make seed-dev` completes that first login the way you would, which is why
the seeded path lands on a password no config file ever held.

`make dev-fresh` is `make dev` onto a rebuilt database — use it when a
previous session left data behind and you want the first-run experience
again. Plain `make dev` keeps what is there.

**Skip the cold start** with `make seed-dev` against a running stack: demo
people, organizations, and deals plus the two rep seats and FX rates. The
seed goes through the public API — same audit trail, same events as real
traffic — and is idempotent; `make seed-reset` wipes the demo workspace for
a clean re-seed.

`make dev` is always safe to re-run: it sweeps first — every margince
api/worker/vite on the machine is killed (including one another checkout left
behind), anything holding `:8080` is evicted, and leftover
`margince_dev_*` databases are dropped. One stack, always the same ports, and
no chance the browser is talking to an api from an older branch. `make dev-stop`
is the mirror: bare, it stops every stack.

**Isolate a second stack.** `make dev DEV_SLUG=<slug>` gives a private
`margince_dev_<slug>` database on slug-derived ports so a second worktree
runs concurrently without colliding; `make dev-stop DEV_SLUG=<slug> [DROP=1]`
tears it down (`DROP=1` also drops the database). The sweep spares a running
slugged stack — but the next bare `make dev` will not.

**Verify** the whole thing end to end (admin login over `/v1`, seeded people
visible, frontend production build — fails loudly on the first broken step).
It reads the demo records, so seed first:

```sh
make seed-dev && make verify-boot
```

Toolchain: Go ≥ 1.26, Docker (Compose), `jq`, `golangci-lint`, and
node+pnpm for the frontend lane. On a fresh worktree, `make install`
does the one-shot setup (frontend deps + the Go gate binaries + the git
hooks); after it, `make check` runs immediately. `make help` lists the
root commands and `make -C backend help` every backend target.

The merge gate is `make check` = `check-backend` (build, vet, lint,
arch-lint, unit + fitness tests, contract drift, and the deterministic
script gates) + `check-fe` (the frontend lane). The real-Postgres lane
is `make test-integration` (parallel, per-package clone DBs; needs
`make db-up`). Full target table:
[docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md); the CI
pipeline that runs these as required checks:
[infra/ci-pipeline.md](infra/ci-pipeline.md). A step-by-step walkthrough
and the full flag/env reference live in [docs/](docs/) (tutorials,
how-to, reference, explanation — see below).

The web UI is the Vite/React app in `frontend/` — a standalone static
build served separately from the API binary, and a plain client of the
same `/v1` contract as everything else — no backdoors (ADR-0013).

Connect an agent (Surface A2): the api serves the governed tool surface
at `/mcp`, on the same origin as `/oauth/*` and the discovery documents.
A client needs only the URL:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http margince <base>/mcp
```

It walks discovery, dynamic client registration, the consent screen and
the token exchange itself; on that screen a human lends one of their own
passports and the connection receives exactly that passport's scopes. A
passport can also be minted directly (`POST /v1/passports`,
session-authed), and the same token is a REST bearer credential,
governed identically (see below).

Deployment note: the login and bootstrap rate limiters key on the direct
peer address (they refuse `X-Forwarded-For` — it is attacker-controlled);
behind a reverse proxy that collapses to one bucket, so enforce
per-client throttling at the proxy.

## How it's built

- **Contract-first.** `backend/api/crm.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.1) is the
  authoritative surface: 3.0-overlay → oapi-codegen types + chi server;
  every operation is mounted (unimplemented ones answer an explicit
  501); regeneration drift is merge-blocking.
- **One governed agent surface, every transport (ADR-0055).** The 🟢/🟡
  autonomy tier of an action is declared once (on the tool spec / the
  contract's `x-mcp-tool` annotation) and enforced below the transport:
  an agent mutation over MCP *or* REST resolves the same tier, stages
  the same approval when 🟡, and **default-denies** any mutating
  operation that carries no tier — fail-closed, drift-linted at build
  time. The same annotation declares the passport **scope** the act
  spends (`read|draft|write|send|enrich`), so a cap the granting human
  withheld cannot be reached by picking a different transport, or by
  reaching a verb that happens to have no registered tool.
  Governance actions (approving, consent, DSR, pipeline/stage
  config) are human-only at the contract, the gate, and the service.
  Admission re-derives the granting human's seat + RBAC live per call,
  so revocation binds mid-session.
- **The write shape.** Every mutation commits domain row + append-only
  `audit_log` row + `event_outbox` row in one transaction (spelled once
  in `platform/database/storekit`); provenance (`captured_by`) is
  stamped from the authenticated principal, never accepted from a
  request body; publishing is always through the outbox to Redis
  Streams, and consumers dedupe because the bus is at-least-once.
- **Tenancy as structure.** Every tenant table carries `ENABLE`+`FORCE`
  row-level security with deny-on-unset policies, reached only through
  the one workspace-transaction helper; every tenant-local foreign key
  is composite `(workspace_id, col)`, so a cross-workspace reference is
  rejected by the database, not merely hidden. Both invariants are
  fitness functions derived from the live schema, not maintained lists.
- **Layout** (spec ADR-0054/A69):
  one Go module under `backend/` (`github.com/margince/margince/backend`)
  as the `internal/{modules,platform,shared}` triad —
  `shared/{kernel,apperrors,ports}` (stdlib-only leaves), `platform/*`
  (plumbing, owns no domain), twenty `modules/` (identity, people,
  deals, activities, approvals, agents, automation, ai, search, capture,
  comms, consent, privacy, collections, signals, customfields,
  webhooks, overlay, migration — no sibling imports; the `de`
  jurisdiction pack is an extension, not a module),
  `internal/compose` (the one composition seam), and three process-role
  binaries
  `cmd/{api,worker,migrate}`. The DAG is enforced three ways
  (depguard, go-arch-lint, and architecture fitness tests that derive
  their package lists from the tree).

## What works today

- **Schema**: the full core data model (data-model.md §1–§11) as 19
  reversible migrations — uuidv7 shim, updated_at+version triggers,
  RLS `ENABLE`+`FORCE` with deny-on-unset policies on all 33 tenant
  tables, composite same-workspace foreign keys (migration 0019),
  append-only audit log, transactional event outbox, and the ADR-0017
  core/custom migration namespaces.
- **Contract pipeline**: OpenAPI 3.1 → 3.0 overlay → oapi-codegen types +
  chi server interface; all operations mounted (unimplemented ones
  answer explicit 501); drift is merge-blocking, and the agent-policy
  generator refuses any mutating operation without an autonomy
  annotation (the ADR-0055 drift-lint).
- **Auth (ADR-0043)**: workspace bootstrap — atomic across identity and
  cross-module defaults, Argon2id email/password
  login, opaque server-side sessions (SHA-256-stored, idle+absolute
  expiry, revoke-at-lookup), five seeded system roles, and the read/full
  seat ceiling enforced before RBAC on both REST and MCP (C2).
- **Core CRUD**: people (emails/phones, 409 dedupe with existing id),
  organizations (domains), pipelines/stages (seeded default), deals
  (advance with stage-semantic-derived won/lost, FX freeze at close,
  stage history), leads (segregated per ADR-0008, natural-key
  idempotent), activities (idempotent capture, polymorphic links, deal
  last_activity_at). Every write commits audit + outbox atomically;
  If-Match optimistic concurrency; keyset pagination.
- **Lead→person promotion (features/01 §6.4)**: `POST /leads/{id}/promote`
  on genuine engagement only; merges into an existing person via the
  email dedupe path — never a duplicate — else creates one carrying
  provenance/owner/email + `converted_from_lead_id`; one transaction,
  one audit row, `lead.promoted` + the caused `person.*` event.
- **Two-record merge (features/01 §1.3)**: `POST /people/{id}/merge` and
  `/organizations/{id}/merge` fold A→B in one transaction —
  collision-aware relink of emails/phones/domains/relationships/activity
  links/consent with zero orphaned FKs, fill-only survivorship, one-hop
  redirect chains, org hierarchy reparenting + the 1:1 partner
  extension, restrictive consent merge, and `person.merged`/
  `organization.merged` events. Reachable as the 🟡 `merge_records` tool
  (pins the survivor's version).
- **Event bus (EP04)**: the full events.md §2 envelope (actor incl.
  passport/on-behalf-of, per-request `correlation_id`, `causation_id`,
  `audit_log_id` linking event↔audit row) as the Tier-0
  `shared/kernel/events` contract with the §5 catalog + §4.1 stream
  routing; the outbox relay (in-process worker) shipping
  committed rows to Redis Streams with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` + MAXLEN
  trimming; the §4.3 consumer-group subscriber (`XREADGROUP`/`XACK`,
  `XAUTOCLAIM` reclaim, in-process workspace filtering); and the
  `event_id` dedupe wrapper (96h TTL) that makes at-least-once safe.
- **RBAC (EP03 remainder)**: object-level CRUD enforcement per role at
  the store entry points (shared by REST and MCP — no agent bypass),
  own/team/all row-scope predicates over `owner_id` (out-of-scope rows
  answer 404, like cross-tenant), the five system roles seeded with real
  permission-policy documents, and the governing rule
  recorded in `audit_log.authorization_rule`.
- **MCP/agent surface (EP06 WP4, Surface A2)**: Agent Seat Passports
  (`POST /v1/passports` mints a scoped, expiring, revocable `mgp_` bearer
  token bound to its issuer — "agent ≤ human" structurally, and live:
  the granting human's seat + RBAC are re-derived at every admission
  through the `shared/ports/authz` seam), the `platform/auth` gate
  (scope ∧ seat ∧ tier BEFORE any handler; its own package so nothing
  mints an admitted capability elsewhere), and the `agents` registry —
  the 🟢 CRUD and read tool set plus the 🟡 confirm-first set, including
  `advance_deal`'s `TierDynamic` resolver (🟢 open→open, 🟡 to won/lost —
  the always-🟡 floor, resolved from the stage's semantic), all composed
  over the frozen-v1 `datasource.SystemOfRecordProvider` seam → the same
  store entry points as HTTP: same RBAC, row scope, audit, events. The
  catalog, its scopes and its refusal shapes are tabled in
  [docs/reference/agent-tools.md](docs/reference/agent-tools.md). Served
  by `cmd/api` at `/mcp` over Streamable HTTP behind the OAuth 2.1 + DCR
  handshake the discovery documents advertise; there is no separate MCP
  binary (SCR-9), and the process binds the installation's singleton
  organization itself (A107/ADR-0061).
- **Transport-agnostic autonomy gate (ADR-0055)**: the
  same passport rides the REST surface with the same governance — a 🟢
  mutation executes (agent-stamped provenance), a 🟡 mutation stages an
  approval and is redeemed by repeating the identical request with
  `X-Approval-Token`, an un-tiered mutating route is refused
  (default-deny), and the human-only governance surface (approvals,
  consent, DSR, pipeline/stage config, passports) rejects agent
  principals outright — the self-approval bypass is structurally closed.
- **Approval engine (EP07 core, ADR-0036)**: a refused 🟡 action lands
  in the `approval` inbox (`approval.requested`) with a one-line
  summary, the exact proposed change, its content hash, and the target
  row's version; humans decide over `/approvals` — the inbox shows only
  approvals the caller could themselves decide;
  deciding is human-only, and the approver must hold the RBAC the effect
  itself needs; redemption is single-use, 15-minute window, bound to the
  staging passport and the content hash, refused on target version skew
  (the human's yes was about the world they saw).
- **AI runtime + certification**: every model call rides one contract-first
  path — tasks and tier ladders compiled from `backend/api/ai-tasks.yaml`,
  runtime provider bindings in the `ai.routing` setting (BYOK:
  Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini/OpenAI-compatible cloud, Ollama/vLLM local, an
  offline fake for dev/test), the one `ai.Router` gate (workspace budget with
  typed deferral, secret stripping, per-attempt `ai_call` tracing), and a
  certification lane (`make e2e-ai`) that scores a candidate model against a
  task's scenario corpus before you trust it. Bounded company context —
  confirmed in the cold start — is injected per declared
  task policy, behind the `company_context.rollout` kill switch. See
  [docs/explanation/ai-runtime.md](docs/explanation/ai-runtime.md) and
  [docs/explanation/company-context.md](docs/explanation/company-context.md).
- **Projects**: the body of work a deal is about — four phases (initiative → pursuing → delivering → closed, movable both ways, closing needs a reason), a key that files any email carrying `[KEY]` in its subject, a deal win that moves its project into delivery, a project 360 with coverage figures, and the composer's project scope for AI drafts; walkthrough in [user-guide/run-your-first-project.md](user-guide/run-your-first-project.md).
- **Web UI**: the Vite/React app in `frontend/` — login, the scene-based
  cold start (website read or manual entry, resumable, with a separate
  three-stop path for an invited member), a collapsible labeled shell over
  the canonical nav, people, leads (with the promote-on-engagement dialog),
  the stage-column deal board with advance, the activity timeline, the
  company record page (one gated read: state strip, health, the standing
  account brief, Ask Margince, next-step suggestions, the one-hop
  connections graph), Approvals, Automations, Reports, and the Company
  Context settings screen — a standalone static build served separately
  from the API, light and dark, design tokens from the product's design
  language. Security headers (CSP, frame-denial, nosniff) are set on every
  API response. See
  [docs/explanation/frontend-architecture.md](docs/explanation/frontend-architecture.md).
- **Gates**: golangci-lint (incl. depguard module DAG, default-deny for
  the Tier-0 layer) clean; go-arch-lint as a hard gate; leaf-purity and
  interface-freeze fitness tests; the ADR-0055 contract drift-lint; an
  integration lane proving the RLS ∅-query, GUC-unset deny, pool-safety,
  version-skew and audit-immutability invariants, the two schema fitness
  functions, an HTTP end-to-end sales flow, the governed-agent-writes
  loop (🟢 executes, 🟡 stages → human approves → token retry executes
  once, agent self-approval refused), the read-seat ceiling, the
  permission-filtered approval inbox, atomic-bootstrap rollback, the
  person/org merge suites, and the bus lane (relay exactly-once /
  crash-republish / commit order, subscriber ack+reclaim+tenant filter,
  dedupe, envelope completeness over the wire).

## Deliberately not here yet

The approval edit-then-approve re-gating path (`edited_payload` answers
422 until it re-enters the gate properly), the `disqualify_lead` and
`enrich` tools (their REST routes are governed and carry a declared cap,
but no MCP tool is registered for them yet), the RLS row-scope backstop (B-EP03.3b), field-level
masking (B-EP03.4), record grants (A52), the Idempotency-Key replay
store, and event versioning/replay/dead-letter (B-EP04.12/.14/.15). The
contract routes for these exist and answer 501.

## Working conventions (where findings go)

Findings are routed, not lost:

- **Implementation decisions** are explained in the commit message and PR
  that makes the change; git history is the record.
- **Decisions that bind future work** — a security posture, a contract
  shape, a persistence choice — are raised with the maintainers, who keep
  the decision records. What binds a change here is enforced by a gate, and
  a gate that refuses names what to do instead.
- **Anything found but not fixed** — a bug, a gap, a follow-up — becomes a
  GitHub issue in this repo, labeled. With one exception that is not a
  preference: an exploitable weakness goes to a private security advisory and
  never to a public issue or pull request, because this repository is public and
  a report that lands before the fix does puts every deployment at risk. See
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Open work** — in-flight work and where to pick up — lives in GitHub issues.
  There is no status file: an issue is the only place a finding survives a
  session, and the commit and PR are the record of what was done.

## Engineering rules learned from the review loop

The rules below are binding for all future work in this repo (mirrored
in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). Each states an invariant this codebase holds
because getting it wrong once was expensive:

1. **Fix the invariant, not the call site.** A fix applied only to the
   case in front of you leaves the sibling copies broken (open vs. closed
   deals; person/org but not lead; a direct read but not its idempotent
   replay). Before closing a finding, grep for every mutation/read site
   of the same column, constraint, or record and fix them as one change.
2. **Prefer fitness functions over point fixes.** A hand-maintained list
   (RLS table enrolment, a lint allow-list) rots silently; a test that
   derives the obligation from the system itself (every `workspace_id`
   table must have FORCE RLS; every CHECK violation must map to a 4xx)
   enforces the *class*. When a fix defends an invariant, ask what gate
   proves it stays fixed.
3. **Anything that returns a record is a read** and carries the read
   path's row-scope gate — including error paths, idempotent-replay
   paths, and conflict disclosures. Error paths are disclosure paths.
4. **Comments carry no build-process residue.** No review-ticket numbers,
   no "fixed per finding #N", no changelog narration — a comment states
   the invariant or trade-off so it reads true standing alone, years
   later, to someone who never saw the review. The history lives in git,
   not in the source. (Same for test names:
   name the invariant pinned, not the review that demanded it.)
5. **Don't rationalize a known gap — close it or gate it.** A comment
   arguing that a race is safe is not a defense, and the argument is
   usually wrong (a dedupe fallback prevents double effects, not dropped
   ones). If a design carries a window, either restructure so it cannot
   happen (run-then-mark) or add the failing test that documents it
   honestly.

6. **A test that supplies its own version of production proves nothing
   about production.** Whatever a test substitutes for the real thing is
   the part the real thing no longer has to get right. Two shapes, both
   already shipped defects here: hand-inserted rows the real writer never
   produces (a signal pass joined `activity_link` on an `entity_type`
   capture never writes — every workspace found zero candidates, the job
   reported success, the page rendered empty for a release), and a
   hand-copied adapter mirroring what `compose` wires (a captured-file
   suite built its own `FileKeeper`, so the production join could have
   been deleted with nothing going red). Seed through the real writer, or
   mirror its exact row shape; if a test needs the wiring, reach for the
   wiring — integration tests live directly in `package compose` for
   exactly this, so unexported adapters are in scope. The tell is writing
   a struct in a test file whose fields mirror something `compose`
   already builds, and an unexpectedly uncovered new file usually means a
   test double stands where the real thing should.

7. **One invariant spelled on both sides of a wire is one item, not
   two.** Most topics are implemented once and merely rendered by the
   other language; this rule is about the ones that are not. Where Go
   and TypeScript each carry a spelling of the same rule, two errors can
   CANCEL — which makes each half look correct in place, and makes
   fixing one half a regression rather than half a fix. The frontend
   wrote `Math.round(amount * 100)` for every currency and the backend
   divided by 100 for every currency, so a zero-decimal price was stored
   a hundredfold and displayed correctly: the screen agreed with itself
   and only the record was wrong. Making the server currency-aware on
   its own would have printed a hundred times the price on an outbound
   offer. So check for the other side before you fix this one, and land
   both in one change. Then declare which side is the MIRROR and gate it
   in both directions — `values.MinorUnitExceptions()` against
   `frontend/src/format/minorunits.ts`, in
   `backend/gates/frontendminorunits_test.go`, which fails on a code present
   on one side only and on a digit count that differs. Two tables that
   happen to agree today is the state this replaces; note that the gate
   covers the shared TABLE, not the two suites' cases, and reads the
   TypeScript with hand-written regexes — so it carries the caveat in
   the next rule rather than escaping it.

8. **A census that can fail short has already failed.** Every failure
   mode of a gate is loud except one: under-recognition. A gate that
   reads a smaller tree reports the same word for it — PASS — and there
   is no failing assertion to notice, so a hand-written census is short
   until proven otherwise, and each miss hides behind whatever also hid
   it from the detector. Three consequences, each of them paid for here.
   No prefilter, skip-list or file shortcut in front of a scan unless
   you have MEASURED that it buys something: one such shortcut survived
   six rounds of being found narrower than the census behind it, two of
   the misses introduced by the fix for the one before, and deleting it
   turned out to be FASTER than keeping it. Match statements, not lines
   — a per-line matcher missed an entire write direction a formatter had
   wrapped across three — and bound the join, or one statement swallows
   a thirty-line `const (` block. And once the gate is green, ask what
   shape of the defect it cannot see and plant that case; that is how
   every hole found in review was found, and none by re-reading the
   implementation.
