# AGENTS.md — operating this repo

Margince CRM implementation PoC (WP0 foundation + WP1 core spine). This is the
repository the product is built in: the running Go software, its contract, its
tests, and its documentation. There is no separate specification that outranks
what is here.

**What decides a question.** In order: the explicit current request from Lars or
the team; then code, tests, migrations and `backend/api/crm.yaml`, which are what
the product does today; then the guardrails (security, privacy, agent authority,
auditability, contract compatibility, licensing, data durability) enforced by
tests wherever possible; then [docs/](docs/). Retired material is history and
never blocks work on its own. The reasoning behind a guardrail is kept by the
team and is not in this repository — you never need it to work here, because the
rule that binds a change is enforced by a gate and a refusing gate names what to
do instead.
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#what-decides-a-question-here) has the long form.

**Do not refuse or narrow ordinary product evolution because an older document
describes a different choice.** Name the conflict and say what it costs. If the
change touches a guardrail, say so in the pull request so the decision behind it
is updated with the code. If the call is someone else's, say whose and open a
`status: needs-decision` issue.

**This repository is public.** Never refer to a private repository, document, path
or link — not in code, comments, tests, docs, issues, commit messages or PR
bodies — and never include local machine paths or secrets.
`TestPublicTreeCitesNothingPrivate` in `backend/publicreferences_test.go` catches
the part of that a test can catch: private references in tracked source and prose
files. Commit messages, PR bodies, secrets and machine paths are on you. A public contributor must be able to follow every instruction this repository
gives them, so write a rule out here rather than citing somewhere they cannot
reach. A decision number (`ADR-0054`) may appear as a label, but never cite it
as though a reader could open it — state the rule itself.

**[docs/principles/](docs/principles/README.md) explains these rules** — six
pages, one per principle, each naming the rulebook section it explains, the
method for checking the tree still holds it, and what it explicitly does not ask
for. That is the PUBLIC explanation and the audit method, which is a different
thing from the private decision rationale described above: a principle page
tells you how to check a rule, not why the team chose it.

The binding short form stays in the rulebooks, and specifically in `AGENTS.md`:
`cli/craft` feeds the whole nearest `AGENTS.md` into its gate prompt, so a rule
relocated to `docs/` stops reaching the gate. Read a principle when you need to
know *why* a rule is shaped the way it is, or when you are auditing a subsystem
against it rather than obeying it on one diff —
[one-source-of-truth.md](docs/principles/one-source-of-truth.md) carries the
six-probe scan for finding a capability that got built twice.

**Start at [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** — open work and the session-pickup point.
Read its *Open work, in one screen* index first and open only the sections that
bear on your change; the file is not meant to be read end to end. Update it at
the end of every working session, keeping it to open work — the narrative of what
you did belongs in the commit and the PR, which is the durable record. Route
findings as you work: implementation decisions are recorded in the commit and PR
that makes the change; a decision that binds future work is raised with the team
so the record lands where the reasoning is kept; a finding you are NOT fixing now
(bug, gap, follow-up task — engineer's call) becomes a GitHub issue in this
repo.

**Label every issue you file.** Unlabeled means untriaged, so an unlabeled
issue lies about your own finding. Exactly one `priority:` and exactly one
`area:`, always:

- `priority: critical` — data loss, a reachable security/privacy breach,
  `main`/CI red, or unusable on a default install. `high` — a real user or
  operator hits it on a live path, or it blocks another workstream.
  `normal` — real but narrow, guarded or latent; hygiene; polish.
  `low` — a want, not a defect, or it needs a decision first.
  Priority is severity, never schedule: a milestone carries the schedule, so
  never demote a real defect because it is not this week's work.
- `area:` (one, where the fix lives) — `agents-mcp` `ai-models` `authz`
  `capture` `ci-tests` `contract-api` `deals` `extensions` `finance`
  `frontend` `overlay` `platform` `privacy` `records` `reports`. A doc that is
  wrong about a subsystem takes that subsystem's area.
- `status: needs-decision` when a human must rule before it is workable — a
  technical call or a product one. Say what the options are and which you
  recommend; an issue that only asks "what should we do?" gives the decider
  nothing to decide from.
- Provenance, additive: `bug`, `enhancement`, `security`, `capability-gap`
  (missing capability, not a defect), `fast-track-debt` (shipped fast, gap
  recorded deliberately). These say why the issue exists — keep them.

**`security` is not a way to report a vulnerability.** This repo is public.
Per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) an exploitable weakness goes to a private
GitHub Security Advisory, never a public issue or PR. The label is for
hardening with no live exploit; if you can write the reproduction — a
cross-tenant read, a row-scope/RBAC escape, an agent-governance bypass, a
forged or still-binding revoked credential, a mutation skipping the audit or
outbox row, injection, SSRF — it belongs in an advisory.

Check for an existing parent tracker (`gh issue list --label "area: <x>"`)
and attach yours as a sub-issue rather than adding another sibling.

## Build / test / seed

All Go code lives under `backend/` (one Go module,
`github.com/gradionhq/margince/backend`); the root Makefile delegates there.

```
make install            # one-shot fresh-worktree setup: FE deps + gate tools + hooks
make db-up              # start PG16 + Redis 7 containers, create the app role
make migrate            # apply core + custom migrations (owner DSN)
make check              # the full merge gate = check-backend + check-fe
make check-backend      # backend half: build, vet, lint (baseline + new-code
                        # strict), arch-lint, unit + fitness tests, contract drift,
                        # plus the root script gates (craft-doc floor, image pins,
                        # contract-breaking, test-lanes, file-length, rls-store-path,
                        # no-jurisdiction, pkg-freeze). This is what CI's
                        # deterministic-gates runs.
make check-fe           # frontend half (biome + vitest + tsc + build)
make test-integration   # real-Postgres lane: RLS gates + HTTP end-to-end (needs db-up).
                        # Parallel — each package on its own throwaway clone db; ends
                        # with `OK: integration passed with 0 skips`, never skips silently
make dev                # full local stack: the app on :8080 (api behind it on :18080)
                        # (worker = cmd/worker, always on: outbox relay + Surface-B runner)
                        # (DEV_SLUG=x → isolated margince_dev_<slug> on slug-derived ports)
make dev-stop           # stop the stack (add DEV_SLUG=x [DROP=1] for an isolated env)
make dev-logs           # follow the stack log, coloured per process; ROLE=/LEVEL=/ALL=1 filter it
```

### EXACTLY ONE dev stack at a time (non-negotiable)

**`make dev` enforces this itself — it sweeps before it starts.** A bare
`make dev` kills every margince api/worker/vite on the machine (recorded,
orphaned, or from another checkout), evicts whatever holds :8080, drops
every leftover `margince_dev_*` database, and only then boots ONE stack on
:8080 against `margince`. So `make dev` is always safe to run; you no
longer stop the old stack by hand.

The failure it removes is the one that does NOT announce itself: an `api`
binary started from an earlier branch keeps serving :8080 happily while Vite
hot-reloads the code you just wrote. The SPA then calls endpoints the running
binary has never heard of, and the app fails in ways that look like your bug
and are not — an old server is indistinguishable from a broken feature.

The api is a compiled binary: **Vite hot-reloads the frontend, the API does
not.** Any backend change — a new endpoint, a migration, a handler fix — needs
`make dev` again (it sweeps and rebuilds). Restarting is the only way your Go
code reaches the browser.

`make dev-fresh` is `make dev` onto a rebuilt database — the first-run
installation again, for when a previous session left data behind.

`make dev-stop` is the mirror: bare, it stops EVERY stack, not just the one it
recorded. The `margince` database survives both (stopping is not deleting);
`DROP=1` removes the per-slug databases only.

`DEV_SLUG=x` still gives an isolated stack (own database, own ports) and is the
one thing the sweep leaves alone — but the next bare `make dev` will take it
down, by design. Tear yours down with `DEV_SLUG=x make dev-stop DROP=1`.

This repo's working tree is often shared with parallel agent sessions that
switch branches under you. Before you trust ANY manual test, confirm both:
`git branch --show-current` is the branch you think it is, and the api on :8080
was started after your last backend change.

`check-q` (quiet), `check-go` (backend-only), `fe-typecheck`, `fe-uat`
(change-scoped Storybook render gate), and `infra-up`/`infra-down` round out
the golden-command set. Full table:
[docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md). The CI
pipeline that runs these gates as required checks — the change classifier, the
job graph, and the SonarCloud coverage flow — is documented in
[infra/ci-pipeline.md](infra/ci-pipeline.md).

Three process-role binaries, all wired through
`internal/compose`: `cmd/api` (HTTP; inline outbox relay behind
`--inline-relay`, default true), `cmd/worker` (standalone relay),
`cmd/migrate` (up|down).

MCP (Surface A2): the api serves the governed tool surface at `/mcp`, on the
same origin as `/oauth/*` and the discovery documents — A1 stdio and its
`cmd/mcp` binary are retired (SCR-9). A client needs only the URL:
`claude mcp add --transport http margince <base>/mcp` walks discovery, DCR,
consent and the token exchange itself. `tools/list` advertises only what the
presenting passport's scopes admit. A passport is also a REST Bearer
credential, governed exactly like MCP (ADR-0055, superseding the old
"read-only on REST" C1 rule) — 🟢 mutations auto-execute, 🟡 ones stage for
confirm-first approval, all still capped by the granting human's live
seat/RBAC. Every call re-authenticates: revocation binds mid-session.

Host requirements: Go ≥ 1.26, Docker, and `golangci-lint` (the codegen
tool chain is pure Go, in its own module `backend/tools/`).

One installation serves one organization (A107/ADR-0061): the server
resolves its singleton organization itself — no request selects a tenant:
`curl http://localhost:8080/v1/me --cookie 'crm_session=…'`. First boot
bootstraps the organization + admin from `margince.yaml` (`--config` /
`MARGINCE_CONFIG`). `make dev` seeds a gitignored `config/margince.yaml`
from `config/margince.example.yaml` on first run and then **leaves it**
(the same create-if-missing / leave-if-exists pattern as
`config/ai-routing.yaml`), so edits — org details, admin, or the
`ai.capture_payloads` posture — persist across `make dev-stop` / `make dev`;
delete it to reset.

Operational surface: `/healthz` (dumb liveness), `/readyz` (dependency
probes; 503 names the unready dependency), and `/metrics` (Prometheus
text: outbox backlog, relay throughput, pool state) sit next to `/v1`.
api and worker take `--log-level` (debug|info|warn|error) and
`--log-format` (text|json), env-backed as `MARGINCE_LOG_LEVEL` /
`MARGINCE_LOG_FORMAT`; an invalid value is a boot error, never a silent
default. The full flag/env table:
[docs/reference/configuration.md](docs/reference/configuration.md).

## Shipping a change (branch → local gates → PR → green → merge)

Every commit lands through this loop — code, docs, and config alike.
Direct pushes to `main` are blocked by branch protection; there is no
other path to merge.

**Run repository publishing with host access.** In a sandboxed agent session,
`gh auth status` is not authoritative because the sandbox may not see the host
keychain even when the active host account is valid. Run the authentication
check again with host escalation before asking the user to re-authenticate.
Every repository or remote mutation must likewise run with host escalation,
including branch creation, commit, rebase, push, PR create/edit/merge, and PR
check monitoring. Read-only working-tree inspection (`git status`, `git diff`,
`git log`) may stay sandboxed.

1. **Branch off `main`**: `git switch -c <type>/<slug> origin/main`.
2. **Sign off every commit** (`git commit -s`) — the DCO gate rejects a
   PR containing any commit without a `Signed-off-by` trailer.
3. **Local gates BEFORE pushing**: `make check` (the merge gate — build,
   vet, lint, arch-lint, unit tests, contract drift); add
   `make frontend-check` when `frontend/` changed. The pre-push hook
   (installed once via `make hooks`) runs `craft static --strict` diff-scoped
   on top — a BLOCKER or MAJOR finding stops the push; fix it, never bypass
   the hook.
4. **Push the branch and open a PR** (`gh pr create`).
5. **Watch the GitHub gates and fix red**: CI, DCO, CodeRabbit, and
   SonarCloud must all pass (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`). Fix failures
   locally, re-run the local gates, push again; address CodeRabbit
   findings rather than dismissing them.
6. **Merge only when everything is green** (squash is the house style:
   `gh pr merge <n> --squash`), then delete the branch. Never merge over
   a red or still-running check.

### Never commit machine or session debris

Only product — code, tests, docs, config templates — belongs in a commit.
Before you `git add`, check `git status` for anything that is a build cache,
a working note, or a screenshot, and leave it out:

- **Build caches** — `.pnpm-store/`, `node_modules/`, compiled binaries.
  Regenerable, machine-local, never tracked.
- **Session scratch** — put working notes, plans, and intermediate output in
  the session's scratchpad temp dir, **not** a `scratchpad/` at the repo root.
- **Screenshots / captures** — a `*.png`/`*.jpg` you took to look at something
  is debris unless the product or the repo docs intentionally reference it
  (e.g. imported from `frontend/src/assets/`, or embedded in a docs page).

`.gitignore` catches the known offenders (root-anchored images, `/.pnpm-store/`,
`/scratchpad/`), but the rule is yours to keep — a new debris path it doesn't
yet list must still stay out, and be added to `.gitignore` when you spot it.

## Layout (ADR-0054: the modules/platform/shared triad, three `cmd/<role>` binaries)

The `backend/internal/{modules,platform,shared}` triad — the DAG is
`shared → platform → modules → compose → cmd`, enforced three ways
(depguard, go-arch-lint, `backend/arch_test.go` fitness tests):

- `internal/shared/` — Tier-0 leaves, stdlib-only (test-enforced):
  `kernel/{ids,events,provenance,principal}`, `apperrors` (the fixed
  sentinel registry — extend it only alongside the error contract it
  implements, never for one call site), and
  `ports/{authz,datasource,mcp,connector,workflow,model,retrieval,extraction,fieldcatalog,jurisdiction}`
  (the frozen seam interfaces + additive provider mechanics).
- `internal/platform/` — technical plumbing, owns no domain:
  `database` (pg pool + the `WithWorkspaceTx` GUC contract that binds every
  tenant statement's workspace predicate) +
  `database/storekit` (the ONE spelling of the audit+outbox write shape,
  keyset cursors, version patches), `auth` (the ONE admission point:
  `Admit` (scope ∧ tier) + object RBAC + row-scope clauses incl. the
  activity link-walk), `events` (outbox relay/subscriber/dedupe),
  `dbmigrate`, `httperr` (RFC 7807 + wire helpers), `httpserver` (chassis).
- `internal/modules/` — twenty-one bounded capabilities, flat by default per
  ADR-0054 §3 (store + mapping + transport + provider in one package),
  growing subpackages only when a named trigger fires (split for a reason, never symmetry); a module NEVER
  imports a sibling: `identity` (workspaces, users, sessions, passports;
  RBAC policy docs ONLY in `identity/internal/policy`),
  `people` (person, organization, lead + merge + promote —
  cross-aggregate single-tx SQL ownership per the §9 single-tx exception), `deals`
  (deal, pipeline/stage config, workspace seed, won/lost + FX freeze),
  `activities` (the timeline: idempotent logging + polymorphic links),
  `approvals` (the 🟡 confirm-first engine, ADR-0036: staged rows ARE
  the authority object), `agents` (the governed tool
  surface: registry, admission gate, the hosted HTTP transport and its
  JSON-RPC dispatcher, the
  Surface-B loop — reaches records only through the datasource seam),
  `automation` (the closed 7×7 trigger/action catalog, ADR-0035: the
  registry, the per-workspace standing automation store, and the
  deterministic trigger runtime — event matcher and clock time-scan
  converging on one path, gated at both author-time and match-time),
  `ai` (the model runtime behind ports/model: BYOK cloud — native
  anthropic/openai/gemini plus the generic openai_compatible wire —
  local ollama/vllm, the offline fake; routing + budget +
  secret-stripping, and the effective-dated `ai_model_rate` sheet the
  read-side pricer prices calls against — `ai_call` stores tokens, never
  a price), `search`
  (row-scoped retrieval: FTS + pgvector/RRF hybrid + context graph),
  `capture` (the ONE `connector.Sink`: normalized inbound capture,
  idempotent on the source natural key), `consent` (per-purpose consent
  + the default-deny outbound suppression gate + the DSR case queue),
  `privacy` (the GDPR engines: Art. 17 erasure, Art. 15 SAR assembly,
  the nightly retention evaluator — the ratified cross-store writer,
  gated by `backend/tableownership_test.go`), `collections`
  (lists — static and dynamic segments — and tags, visibility-probed),
  `signals` (the consent-gated warm-room substrate: company-level
  signals, the inspectable resolver, warm/cold join), `customfields`
  (the governed add-field engine: the sole runtime `ALTER TABLE`
  chokepoint; record stores read the `cf_*` columns via the
  `fieldcatalog` seam), `quotas` (RD-T06 owner-XOR-team revenue
  targets, human-set, workspace-shared config posture), `webhooks`
  (outbound webhook subscriptions + owner-scoped delivery, E10), and `overlay` (the incumbent-CRM mirror: a second
  `datasource.SystemOfRecordProvider` selected per-workspace by
  `workspace.x_sor_mode`, serving mirror-backed reads behind the inner
  `incumbent.Incumbent` seam — fail-closed visibility deny-join,
  budget-metered force-fresh read-through, continuous sync (backfill +
  reconcile poller), disconnect teardown, and the ADR-0071
  overlay→native cutover; `Update`/`Archive` write back incumbent-first
  and re-mirror the returned state, while
  `Create`/`Merge`/`PromoteLead`/`AdvanceDeal` + RunReport are declared
  `unsupported_by_sor`), `comms`
  (outbound delivery machinery — the durable staging row, the
  transmit-time gates, the provider dispatcher; the message itself is an
  activity), `migration` (the shared importer engine behind the
  overlay→native cutover: classification, a zero-write dry run, and a
  checkpointed resumable run loop over injected source/writer seams).

  Two sanctioned spine shapes, and ONLY two — don't invent a third:
  **Handlers→Store** for CRUD modules (people, deals, activities, …:
  the store owns the transactional write shape and the RBAC gate at its
  entry points) and **Handlers→Service** for engine modules (approvals,
  identity: a service owns the multi-step domain logic and drives the
  SQL inside it).
- `internal/compose/` — the composition layer every process role shares:
  the contract HTTP surface (every module's handler set embeds directly
  into `Server`, which asserts the full generated `ServerInterface` on
  its own — a contract operation with no handler is a build break, not
  a served 501), the composite `datasource.SystemOfRecordProvider`, the MCP registry +
  approvals adapter, and the cross-module integration suites (in
  `compose/integration`, with the shared harness). Every cross-module
  edge is injected HERE (identity's workspace seed ← deals; agents'
  staging ← approvals). Cross-module ORCHESTRATION groups live in
  subpackages under the same named-trigger growth policy (`compose/briefs`
  is the pilot); a compose subpackage never durably owns a business
  entity.
- `internal/contracts/` — GENERATED from `backend/api/crm.yaml`. Never edit.
- `backend/api/crm.yaml` — the authoritative OpenAPI 3.1 contract.
- `backend/migrations/core|custom/` — the ADR-0017 namespaces.
  `modules/<name>/custom/` + `migrations/custom/` — the fork-owned seam:
  upstream never writes there (ADR-0054 §7).
- `backend/tools/` — the codegen tool chain (contract-overlay,
  gen-stubs, gen-agentpolicy); its own Go module so the generators'
  dependencies stay out of the product module's go.mod.
- `frontend/` — the Vite/React web UI: a standalone static build served
  separately from the API binary (which serves `/v1` only — no embedded
  SPA); `make frontend-check` / `make dev` exist at the repo root.
  **Working in here? Read [frontend/CLAUDE.md](frontend/CLAUDE.md) first**, and
  then the file it opens with:
  **[frontend/src/design-system/README.md](frontend/src/design-system/README.md)
  is the catalog of every control that already exists** — cards, buttons,
  inputs, fields, badges, tables, menus, dialogs, empty states. Open it BEFORE
  building anything visible. Every interactive control comes from
  `frontend/src/design-system/`; a native `<select>` fails
  `frontend/scripts/check-native-controls.sh`, but nothing automated can tell
  that the component you just wrote already existed under another name, which is
  how this tree has twice grown a second spelling of a card.
- `extensions/<name>/` — the stable extension tier (ADR-0120): each unit
  is its own Go module importing ONLY the marker-allowlisted
  `backend/pkg/**` surface; presence under `extensions/` is the
  enablement. The vanilla tree ships four first-party units: `de` (the
  German jurisdiction pack — GoBD calendar-year retention floors),
  `notes`, `relay-probe` (the provider-facing reference — capture, a
  merge-key declaration and a transport) and `yogi` (one served 🟢/read
  agent tool — the worked example of the governed-tool kind).
  Read `extensions/` for the live list rather than trusting this sentence — a
  count in prose goes stale the first time somebody adds a unit. `make composition` (run by every build lane)
  generates the ignored `build/composition/` wiring; `composition/` at
  the root is the committed vanilla stub so bare go commands resolve.

## DO NOT TOUCH

- `internal/contracts/api_gen.go`, `internal/compose/stubs_gen.go` —
  generated (`make gen`); the drift gate fails a hand edit.
- `migrations/core/*` that have shipped — additive migrations only. core/ opens
  with a single baseline file (`0001`) whose internal order is a dependency
  order; a new migration goes after it, named for the unix second it was
  written, and updates `migrations/testdata/head_catalog.txt` in the same
  commit.
- The `database.WithWorkspaceTx` GUC contract — every tenant query goes through
  it; there is no raw-pool path for tenant data. Core tenant isolation is a
  per-statement predicate bound by that contract and held by
  `scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh`; core carries no row-level security at all.
  Extension tables still carry FORCE RLS.
- `internal/shared/apperrors` — the fixed sentinel registry; extend it only
  alongside the error contract it implements, never for one call site.

## The write shape (non-negotiable)

Every mutation commits domain row + `audit_log` row + `event_outbox` row
in ONE transaction — spelled once in `platform/database/storekit`
(`Audit` + `Emit`), called by every module store. `captured_by` is
stamped from the authenticated principal, never from the request body.
The outbox envelope is the `shared/kernel/events` contract (events.md
§2): the HTTP layer mints one `correlation_id` per request, `Audit()`
returns the audit row id, `Emit()` links both into the trace —
publishing is ALWAYS through the outbox (`platform/events.Relay` ships
it; no direct XADD from domain code) and consumers wrap handlers in
`events.Dedupe` because the bus is at-least-once. Every store entry
point is RBAC-gated (`auth.Require` + `auth.EnsureVisible` + the list
scope clauses in `platform/auth`): object denial →
`apperrors.ErrPermissionDenied` (403), row-scope miss →
`apperrors.ErrNotFound` (404, existence-hiding).

## Reuse before you build (non-negotiable)

A second implementation of one capability is not untidy — it is two answers to
one question, and the two drift until they disagree in front of a user. Five
rules, each of them here because this tree has already paid for it.

**1. Search the whole tree, not your directory.** Before adding a capability,
grep its nouns across `backend/`, `frontend/src/` and `extensions/`. The
duplicate is almost never in the package you are editing — that is precisely why
it gets missed. The agent tool `prep_for_meeting` was written beside a working
`compose/meetingbrief/` that a one-word grep would have found, and the two
answered one question with different grounding rules until a seam was written.

**2. The tool surface and the web surface share ONE engine.** An MCP tool never
re-derives what an HTTP handler already computes. The binding is a
`compose/*seam*.go` file, and the seams that exist each state the rule in their
own words — `briefseam.go`: "one queue rather than two readings of it";
`importseam.go`: "it delegates rather than reimplementing, and that is the whole
design". **If no seam exists for the capability you need, write the seam** — do
not write a second assembler. A module may not import a sibling or `compose`
(ADR-0054 §3), so rolling your own will always look like the cheaper path; it is
the wrong one, and this is the case where saying so out loud is the only thing
that helps.

**3. Never hand-type a SQL placeholder.** Derive `$N` from the argument slice —
`args = append(args, v)` then `fmt.Sprintf("%s = $%d", col, len(args))`, as
`deals/offer_lines.go` does — or use `storekit.InsertFragments`. Nothing in this
repo checks that a statement's column count, placeholder count and argument
count agree, so a hand-numbered statement is one careless sweep away from
binding every column to the wrong value. That is not hypothetical: it shipped in
`people/researchclaim.go`, and the accept path was dead for two days because no
test executed the statement.

The `%s` in that pattern is the COLUMN, and it carries its own rule: a compile-
time literal, or a catalog name quoted with `pgx.Identifier.Sanitize` — the one
spelling this repo uses (`storekit/customcolumns.go`). Never a string off a
request body. Values are always `$N`; only identifiers are ever formatted, and
an identifier a caller chose is an injection with a placeholder's manners.

**4. A comment may not claim to be the only implementation unless a test holds
it.** "the one spelling of X", "the only writer of Y", "the same anonymization
the eraser performs" — if no test fails when a second one appears, delete the
claim or write the test. Nine of the ten claims counted in this tree were
false. A false uniqueness claim is worse than silence: the next author greps,
finds it, and stops looking.

**5. A gate that hard-codes any part of its subject has become a second copy of
it.** A census over consumer-mail domains that carries its own sample of them, a
design gate that restates the element list it forbids, a parity test with a
hand-maintained coverage map — each is the duplicate it was written to refuse,
and it goes quietly short the day somebody extends the owner. Derive the gate's
corpus from the owner it protects — `freemail.Domains()`, the contract, the tree
— or say in the test why it cannot be. Every gate the duplication sweep produced
was found, after shipping and by a reviewer, to have hard-coded part of its own
subject; two reviewers independently named the domain sample that a
consumer-mail gate kept inside the test forbidding second consumer-mail lists.

**Two writers of one invariant either share a helper or say why they do not.**
If you are adding the second, put the reason in the code beside it, not in the
pull request where the next reader will not see it.

Catalogs to read before building anything they might already list:
[docs/reference/modules.md](docs/reference/modules.md) for backend capabilities,
[frontend/src/design-system/README.md](frontend/src/design-system/README.md) for
every control that already exists.

## Craftsmanship

The anti-tell catalog T1–T11, in full below — this list is the rule, not a summary
of one kept elsewhere. The rule under every rule:
**code that reads best to a human reads best to the next agent that edits it** —
legibility is the product, not polish.

- Comments say *why*, not *what* (T1). Domain names, not `data/tmp/helper` (T4).
- **Never swallow an error** — no `_ = f()`, no empty `catch`, no ignored return;
  errors flow through the sentinels, and messages are actionable and never leak
  internals (no stack/SQL/table names to a client) (T2).
- No `any`/`as`/unchecked assertions (T6). No dead or speculative code, no
  abstraction without a second concrete caller today, no `TODO` without an issue
  ref (T3/T8).
- Handle the honest hard cases (empty page, version skew, cross-tenant, GUC-unset) (T7).
- **Tests prove behaviour or they are noise (T11):** no assertion-free test (it can
  only fail by panicking), no `time.Sleep` / real-clock / real-network flakiness, no
  over-mocking that asserts call-order; mock only true boundaries (DB/HTTP/clock/queue)
  and inject a `Clock`. Tests read as specs; the integration lane fails loudly without a
  database — a skipped security gate looks exactly like a passing one.
- **Pre-submit self-check:** would a senior write it this way? does it match the
  surrounding file? do the errors say what-went-wrong *and* what-to-do? would a stranger
  find where this change lives without a guide? is this the smallest diff that does the job?

**The gate runs before every push (diff-scoped), and it is STRICT.**
`.githooks/pre-push` runs the deterministic arm — `craft static --strict` (the repo's
`cli/craft` tool, ADR-0045) — over the Go files **this push changes vs
`origin/main`** in `backend/`, `extensions/`, `fixtures/` and `desktop/` alike (a
first-party extension unit and the desktop launcher both ship the same product). New/touched
code must be clean. There is no pre-existing backlog to exempt: the whole tree was
cleared to zero findings before this bar was armed. So write it right the first time
— a swallowed error, a sleep in a test, a bare `any` in a signature, or an 81-line
function you add will block your push.
- Install the hook once after cloning: **`make hooks`** (sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`).
- Full manual sweep of every hand-written Go tree (`backend/`, `extensions/`,
  `fixtures/`, `desktop/`): **`make craft-static`** — green, and the CI
  `craftsmanship` job runs the same bar as a required check.
- `BLOCKER` and `MAJOR` findings both block; `MINOR` is advisory. The size ceilings are
  80 CODE lines / 500 file lines for product code and 160 / 1000 for `*_test.go`.
  A comment-only line is not length for the FUNCTION ceiling: it asks how much a
  reader must hold at once, and an explanation reduces that. The whole-tree file
  check in `scripts/check-go-file-length.sh` is a plain `wc -l` and counts every
  line, with a ratchet file freezing each pre-existing offender.
- A *genuine* false positive is waived **in-source with a reason**: `//craft:ignore <check> <reason>`
  (a reasonless waiver is itself a finding).

## License headers (every new hand-written Go file)

Every hand-written `*.go` file starts with the BUSL-1.1 SPDX header — the
two lines at the very top, above the `package` clause, followed by a blank
line:

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Gradion
```

Exempt: generated files (`*_gen.go`) and the drift-frozen
`internal/contracts/` package — do NOT stamp those. The rule is enforced by
`TestEveryHandWrittenGoFileCarriesTheLicenseHeader` in
`backend/license_test.go` (part of `make check`), which derives the file
list from the tree — `backend/`, `extensions/` and `fixtures/`, since each
unit is its own module — so a new file that skips the header fails the gate.
Keep the copyright line as-is (`2026 Gradion`); it names the release year,
not the current year. This is the license model's "honest labeling / don't
strip notices" obligation (spec `business/12-license.md` §5, §8).

## Rules learned from the review loop (binding)

Full rationale in [README.md](README.md#engineering-rules-learned-from-the-review-loop);
the short form:

1. **Fix the invariant, not the call site** — grep every mutation/read
   site of the same column/constraint/record and fix them as one change
   (the recurring reviewer catch here was "fixed the case under review,
   missed the sibling copy").
2. **Prefer fitness functions over point fixes** — derive the obligation
   from the system (e.g. every tenant statement carries its workspace
   predicate; every CHECK violation maps to a 4xx; `backend/arch_test.go` derives
   its package lists from the tree), don't maintain it as a list.
3. **Anything that returns a record is a read** and carries the row-scope
   gate — including replay, conflict, and error paths.
4. **No build-process residue in comments** — no review-ticket numbers or
   fix narration; state the invariant so it stands alone. History belongs
   to git, not the source. Same for test names.
5. **Never rationalize a known gap in a comment** — restructure it away
   or gate it with a test.
6. **A test that supplies its own version of production proves nothing
   about production** — hand-inserted rows the real writer never writes,
   or a hand-copied adapter mirroring what compose wires. Seed through
   the real writer; if a test needs the wiring, reach for the wiring
   (integration tests live directly in `package compose` so unexported
   adapters are in scope). An unexpectedly uncovered new file usually
   means a test double stands where the real thing should.
7. **One invariant spelled on both sides of a wire is ONE item, not
   two.** Most topics are implemented once — but where Go and TypeScript
   each carry a spelling of the same rule, fixing one side alone can be
   a REGRESSION rather than half a fix: a money scale wrong in both
   directions cancels, the screen agrees with itself, and making the
   server correct by itself prints a hundred times the price on the
   offer a buyer signs. So check for the other side before you fix this
   one, and land both in one change. Then make one side a DECLARED
   mirror of the other, held by a gate that fails in BOTH directions —
   `values.MinorUnitExceptions()` against
   `frontend/src/format/minorunits.ts`, in
   `backend/frontendminorunits_test.go` — rather than two tables that
   only happen to agree today.
8. **A census that can fail short has already failed.**
   Under-recognition is the one way a gate must not break: it reads a
   smaller tree and reports the same word for it, PASS, and there is no
   failing assertion to notice. So — no prefilter, skip-list or file
   shortcut in front of a scan unless you have MEASURED that it buys
   something (parsing the whole tree is usually a couple of seconds, and
   one shortcut here was slower than the parse it avoided); match
   STATEMENTS, not lines, and bound the join; and once the gate is green,
   ask what shape of the defect it CANNOT see and plant that case. Prefer
   deleting a dimension to narrowing it a seventh time.
