-- The release guard covers the byline too.
--
-- activity_refuse_restricted_mutation is what makes "a restriction is not left
-- while the content is still readable" true INDEPENDENTLY of any caller. It
-- checked body, raw, counterparty_email and the subject.
--
-- `source_author_name` arrived later: a human's name carried in from the
-- system a record was imported from. The Art. 17 redaction clears it in Go
-- wherever it clears the rest, and the trigger never learned about it — so a
-- direct UPDATE that cleared the restriction triplet and the four old content
-- fields, leaving the byline set, passed and made the row readable again with
-- the name intact.
--
-- Both application release routes go through the corrected Go helper, so this
-- was defence in depth rather than a reachable bypass. Defence in depth is the
-- whole point of having the trigger: the invariant is supposed to hold against
-- a statement nobody wrote yet.
--
-- NOT NULL rather than "changed", which is the test the subject gets. A subject
-- is replaced by the erasure's tombstone name, so demanding null there would
-- refuse the statement this guard exists to admit. A byline has no tombstone —
-- every writer clears it outright — so null is what it must be.
