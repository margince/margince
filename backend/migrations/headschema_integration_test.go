package migrations_test

// headSchema is for the tests in this package that want the schema the
// migrations BUILD, not the act of building it.
//
// Most suites here rewind and replay: they drop everything, apply a prefix,
// assert on what a repair or a rollback did. That is why this package is carved
// out of backend/integrationmigrateonce_test.go's migrate-once rule, and it
// stays carved out. But roughly a quarter of its tests only read the head
// catalog — is this column generated, is that view security_invoker, does every
// row-scoped FK carry a visibility decision — and they were taking the carve-out
// too, paying a DROP SCHEMA CASCADE and a full replay of every embedded
// migration (~1.3s each) to arrive at a schema the lane had already handed them:
// every clone is copied from an already-migrated template.
//
// So: build head ONCE per process, then verify it is still head before each
// later use and rebuild only when it is not. The verification is what makes this
// safe to mix with the rewinding suites in the same binary — they run on the
// same database, and one of them leaves it two migrations short.

// headFingerprint is the catalog of the schema this process built at head,
// captured the first time headSchema ran. Empty until then.
//
// A digest of the catalog, not the migration ledger's version set. The ledger
// records a version, not a checksum — scripts/lib-testdb.sh says so where it
// decides whether to reuse the template — so a version set answers "which
// migrations were applied" and cannot answer "is the schema still what they
// build". Both questions have to come out right here: a rewinding suite that
// leaves the ledger at head having altered a table would pass a version check
// and hand the next reader a schema nothing in this package built.
var headFingerprint string

// headRebuilds counts the full drop-and-replay rebuilds headSchema has done, so
// its own test can tell the cheap path from the expensive one. Nothing else
// distinguishes them: both leave a database at head with no rows in it, which is
// exactly why a helper that quietly rebuilt every time would go unnoticed and
// give back the whole saving.
var headRebuilds int

// headSchema hands the caller a database at head with no rows in it.
//
// The FIRST call in the process rebuilds unconditionally — drop, then replay
// every embedded migration — so the reference catalog is one this binary's own
// migrations produced rather than whatever the template happened to hold. That
// closes the case the template cannot: the ledger cannot see an edited or
// renumbered migration, so a clone built from a template that diverged from this
// checkout is at "head" by the only measure the database keeps.
//
// Later calls compare the live catalog against that reference and rebuild only
// on a mismatch, which is what the rewinding suites in this package produce.
// Matching costs one query instead of a full replay.
//
// Data is emptied by testdb.Reset either way, so a caller may write rows; it
// gets the same clean slate a rebuild gave it.

// catalogDigest is one md5 over the schema the migrations build, at the grain the
// tests that ride it actually read.
//
// That last clause is the whole design, and getting it wrong is worse than
// having no digest at all — a fingerprint blind to the objects its readers care
// about still READS as verification. So the contents are derived from what the
// head-only tests in this package assert on, one line each:
//
//   - columns, types, nullability — every one of them, and the baseline
//   - column defaults and generated expressions — schema_fitness asserts that
//     amount_minor_base is database-generated, and a column keeping its name,
//     type and nullability while losing its GENERATED clause is precisely the
//     move a rewind makes
//   - view definitions and reloptions — schema_fitness asserts a rollup view is
//     security_invoker, which lives in reloptions and in nothing else here
//   - triggers AND the function bodies they execute — the version bump and
//     audit_log's append-only guard are trigger behaviour, asserted by two
//     tests. Both halves, because pg_get_triggerdef prints which function a
//     trigger calls and not what that function does, and a migration that
//     changes nothing but a function body is a shape this tree ships
//   - table grants — the two behaviour tests above connect as the app role, so
//     a revoked grant changes what they observe while disturbing no object
//   - indexes and constraints — asserted directly by the cascade-index and FK
//     visibility tests
//   - the privilege and isolation surface no behaviour test here reaches, but a
//     migration can widen in one line: SECURITY DEFINER and search_path on a
//     function, EXECUTE grants, schema-level grants, default privileges, and
//     row-level security state including every policy. None of these change an
//     object's shape, so a projection built from shapes alone would call
//     `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO margince_app` a no-op
//   - NOT extension-owned objects. pgvector alone installs ~109 functions into
//     public, and the image is digest-pinned: carrying them would make a
//     Renovate bump of that digest read as the migrations having changed head
//
// A schema with no objects at all digests to the empty string rather than to
// SQL NULL, so a caller arriving after a suite that dropped the schema and left
// it dropped reads a mismatch and rebuilds — the outcome it needs — instead of
// failing on a scan.
