// A deployed installation's migration role owns the schema and is NOT a
// superuser. A superuser ignores every privilege check, so a migration that
// needs one it was never granted applies cleanly for the dev and CI owner (the
// Postgres container's POSTGRES_USER) and fails on the installation that has to
// run it — the one difference that separates a migration which works from one
// that only appears to.
//
// This file supplies the role that tells the two apart, and states the mechanism
// once so the tests that rely on it are not each re-arguing it.

// 0202 added `CREATE SCHEMA ext`. CREATE SCHEMA is a DATABASE-level privilege,
// not a schema-level one, and the restricted stand-in held only CREATE on
// public — so four tests in this package broke with `permission denied for
// database`. Nothing went red for the author: the merge gate does not run the
// integration lane, so every gate a task runs locally passed. The four that did
// break were about RLS, backfills and rollbacks; each named its own subject in
// its failure, and none of them said "your migration needs a privilege the
// deployed role was never granted".
//
// This says exactly that, and it is deliberately CHEAP — one reset, one
// migration pass, no assertions about content — rather than the alternative of
// putting the whole integration lane on the merge gate, which would change that
// gate's cost for every task in the repository forever. The bargain is that the
// signal arrives in the integration lane rather than at `make check-q`, but it
// arrives NAMED.
//
// A migration adding any other database-scoped statement (CREATE EXTENSION of an
// untrusted extension, CREATE DATABASE, an event trigger) fails here for the same
// reason, and the fix is the same shape: grant the stand-in what a deployed
// installation's migration role already holds — or, if a deployed one would not
