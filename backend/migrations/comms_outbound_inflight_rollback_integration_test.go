// 0156's rollback proven directly. The in-flight marker is the ONLY record that
// a channel message may already be with the customer, and a channel seam has no
// prior-send lookup to reconstruct it from. So reversing the migration is not a
// schema question: the rows whose outcome was never learned have to be closed
// before the evidence goes, or a re-applied 0156 hands them back to the runner
// looking untried and the customer gets a second copy.
//
// `migrate down` reverts newest-first, so the step count is derived from where
// 0156 actually SITS rather than assumed to be one. What matters is that 0156
// is the LAST migration reverted: 0155's blanket DELETE of the channel rows
// must not run, or the rows this test is about are gone before it looks.
//
// Written as a literal 1, this reverted whichever migration happened to be
// newest and still passed, because the guard asserted the COUNT. The next
// migration anyone added turned it into a test of that migration instead.
