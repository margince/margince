// A field name published to a caller has to BE a field name.
//
// The defect this closes, found in seven places at once: a typed refusal put
// prose in the slot both surfaces publish as the machine-readable field —
// `RequiredFieldError{Field: "to (must follow from)"}`,
// `{Field: "ended_at: must not precede started_at"}`,
// `{Field: "kind: " + kind + " endpoint shape"}`. REST renders that slot as
// `details.errors[].field` and the MCP dispatcher renders it as the field token
// in `validation_error <field>=<code>`, so the answer came out garbled and
// nothing downstream could branch on it. Worse, every one of them arrived under
// the code `required` while the value was in fact supplied and merely
// inconsistent — so a caller acting on the code would add a field it had
// already sent.
//
// The rule: a string literal in a FieldFault's field position is a contract
// field path — lowercase, underscores, dots for nesting. Prose is a message, and
// FieldFault has a message parameter for it. A condition that names no single
// fixable argument is a MessageFault instead, which publishes no field at all;
// that is the honest answer when the mismatch is between two arguments rather
// than in one.
//
// Scope is DERIVED: the types policed are those implementing FieldFault or
// FieldFaults anywhere under internal/, so a new refusal type inherits this
// without being listed.
//
// MessageFault implementors are out of scope because the taxonomy publishes no
// field for them at all — their whole answer is a code and a message. That is a
// claim about the taxonomy, not about the types: a MessageFault type may still
// keep a Field member for its own message (compose's FieldNotAllowedError holds
// the rejected token that way), and a transport branch that lifted such a member
// into a wire `field` would be outside this walk. The report transport did
// exactly that until it was deleted in favour of the fault.
