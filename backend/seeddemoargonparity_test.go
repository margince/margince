// seed-demo writes password hashes a REAL person then logs in against, and it
// cannot import the hashing package: that package sits behind a nested
// `internal`, and seed-demo is its own module besides. So the Argon2id
// parameters are restated there, and a restatement drifts.
//
// The comment that used to guard this said a demo user failing to log in was
// the signal. There is no such signal. Verify parses the cost parameters out of
// the PHC hash itself:
//
//	fmt.Sscanf(parts[3], "m=%d,t=%d,p=%d", &m, &t, &p)
//
// so a hash written at ANY parameters verifies successfully, forever, and
// nothing re-hashes on login. Lower seed-demo's constants and every demo user
// signs in perfectly while their stored hash is weak — silently, permanently,
// and invisibly to every other gate in this tree.
//
// That is why this is a gate and not a comment. It reads both files' source
// rather than importing either, which is the only thing the module boundary
// permits, and compares what seed-demo will actually compile against what the
// product ships.
