// A field the contract PROMISES and nobody WRITES is invisible.
//
// `make drift` proves the generated Go matches api/crm.yaml. Nothing proves a
// handler fills what the contract advertises, so a schema property with no
// producer ships as permanently absent — and absent, on these composites,
// reads as a fact about the account. `last_meeting_at` sat on
// Organization360Health for exactly that reason: promised, never set, and
// rendering as "no meeting" on every company in the product.
//
// This is the shape of bug that adding fields to a composite creates, so it is
// derived rather than listed: the struct's own field set is the obligation, and
// a new property joins the check by existing.
//
// SCOPE is deliberately the page composites rather than every schema. Most
// contract types are request bodies or are filled by a mapper the compiler
// already forces to be total; these three are assembled field by field from
// separate readers, which is where a field quietly goes unwritten (ADR-0095).
