// integration.RetentionPassCtx binds a SYSTEM principal, because that is the

// reports true for a system principal, and auth.Require and auth.EnsureVisible
// short-circuit for it — so a visibility or row-scope assertion made THROUGH this
// context passes whatever the row scope is. Such a test looks exactly like the
// gate it is impersonating.
//
// The fixture is exported, which is what puts it in reach of every suite in the
// tree rather than the one file that declared it. So the bound is enforced here:
// it may be passed to the retention engine and nowhere else.
//
// It matches every REFERENCE, not every call, and that distinction is the whole
// gate. `passCtx := integration.RetentionPassCtx` followed by `passCtx(ws)` binds
// the same undeniable principal as the direct spelling, and a gate watching only
// CallExpr nodes would not see it — worse, it would not count it either, so the
// liveness check below would stay satisfied by the honest call sites while the
// aliased one went unexamined. backend/integrationmigrateonce_test.go bounds its
// own entry point the same way and for the same reason.
