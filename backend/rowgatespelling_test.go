// A module's READ spelling of a row gate is not a licence to write through it.
//
// writeauthority_test.go asks the tier-wide question — is each probe on a
// mutating path the write-authority spelling — and ratifies the shared read
// helpers by NAME, because a helper like deals' visibleOffer really is a read
// probe wherever it is called from. That is what makes this gate its
// complement rather than a second copy: the waiver is keyed on the function
// HOLDING the probe, so once a package's read spelling is ratified, a NEW
// write that resolves its row through it inherits the waiver and the tier gate
// reads green over it. The class is not hypothetical. An offer's PDF render
// persisted its blob ref through the read spelling while every other offer
// write took the write one, so any seat that could SEE a deal could overwrite
// and destroy the offer PDF hanging off it.
//
// The population is derived from the tree, so a module that grows the pattern
// inherits the obligation rather than being added to a list:
//
//   - a package's READ spelling is a function whose record-authority probes are
//     visibility ones only;
//   - it has a WRITE twin when some function in the same package calls it and
//     adds a write-authority probe. That pairing is the package's own statement
//     that the two authorities differ for its rows, so a package without one is
//     out of scope rather than failed;
//   - the OBLIGATION is that a function reaching the storekit write shape does
//     not call the read spelling directly. It goes through the twin.
//
// The obligation deliberately admits no "unless this function takes the probe
// itself" exemption. A frame-level one cannot tell WHICH row the probe
// authorized, so it would excuse the very shape this exists to catch: a
// function that correctly gates row A, then resolves row B through the read
// spelling and writes B. Nothing in the tier needs the exemption — every
// writer already goes through its package's twin — so the strict rule costs
// nothing today, and the first genuine exception argues for itself in review
// rather than passing in silence.
