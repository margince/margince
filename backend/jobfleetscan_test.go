// The fleet enumeration lives at ratified sites only. A `SELECT id FROM
// workspace` inside a module is the signature of the anti-pattern this phase
// removed: one job row looping every tenant, logging each failure and
// returning success, so River records a green sweep over workspaces that
// failed. Dispatchers enumerate; workers take the workspace they were given.

// just `FROM workspace`, not the full `WHERE archived_at IS NULL` predicate:
// idempotency retention enumerates every workspace INCLUDING archived ones, so
// a marker built around the archived-at filter would never have seen the one
// fleet loop that does not use it — the gate would have been green while the
// anti-pattern lived on.
//
// It still only catches the literal spelling. An alias, a newline inside the
// FROM clause, a schema qualification, or a view would evade it. That residual
// is accepted because the gate's job is to stop the shape being re-introduced
// by habit, not by determined circumvention.

// Matched as a PREFIX rather than requiring a bind parameter: the tree also
// resolves one workspace by correlated subquery (`WHERE id = d.workspace_id`)
// and through the GUC (`WHERE id = NULLIF(current_setting(...))`). Any
// predicate equating id to a single value is a single-row read by
// construction — with the exception of a SET-valued RHS, which setPredicates
// takes back. Checked on the marker's own line and the one after it, because
// the repo splits some query literals across lines.

// ratifiedFleetScans are the sanctioned enumeration sites, keyed by

// remaining site is stale; a count that no longer matches is either a new scan
// to justify or a removed one to un-ratify.
//
// A reason must name which of exactly four things the site is:
//
//  1. a DISPATCHER's own enumeration — it reads the fleet only to enqueue one
//     workspace-scoped job per tenant, and does no tenant work itself;
//  2. a READ — the enumeration and everything it drives write nothing;
//  3. a BOOT path — it runs once at startup, before any job exists to run it;
//  4. TENANT RESOLUTION for an untenanted inbound request — a push or a webhook
//     carries no tenant, so the scan finds the ONE workspace that owns it and
//     the work then happens in that workspace alone.
//
// What a reason may NOT rest on is the site being outside the job layer. Every
// fleet pass is a job now, so "not reachable from a Work method" describes
// nothing durable: the next pass to want this enumeration reaches it from a
// worker, and a waiver granted on that basis would already have waved it
// through.
