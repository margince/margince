// The census as a fitness function, in both directions. api/jobs.yaml says what
// every job kind is; internal/compose is what actually wires one. Each half is
// checked against the other elsewhere in pieces — the generated union stops an
// undeclared kind compiling, MustBeTotal refuses a boot that registers one — but
// nothing until now held the WHOLE declaration to the WHOLE wiring: a kind
// declared and never registered, a derived timeout whose Go constant moved, an
// args field nobody declared. Those are the drifts a declaration nothing checks
// accumulates, and this is where the composition is held to it.
