// Every RBAC object must reach an EXISTING installation, not just a fresh one.
//
// The code-side seed (identity.seedSystemRoles) writes the role documents once
// at workspace creation and never re-syncs, so an object added to
// policy.coreObjects without a backfill migration is granted to nobody who
// bootstrapped earlier — it "works on a fresh database and 403s everywhere
// else", permanently. That is exactly how saved_view, webhook_subscription,
// relationship and partner reached production ungranted.
//
// THE PROOF THIS FILE FED NO LONGER EXISTS, and the obligation above does.
//
// That proof was the replay in backend/migrations: seed the documents an old
// installation held, upgrade it to head, assert the end state equals the matrix
// the server seeds today. The baseline consolidation deleted it along with the
// migration history it replayed — correctly, because no database can move from
// a pre-baseline schema onto the baseline at all (dbmigrate refuses; see
// migrations.go). So the UPGRADE half of the obligation is genuinely void.
//
// The FRESH-INSTALL half is not, and it is gated again — in
// compose/integration/rbacseedparity_integration_test.go rather than here,
// because proving it needs a database and a real bootstrap. Two obligations
// live there: what the bootstrap actually writes equals the seeded matrix, and
// every backfill migration converges an installation that predates it ON that
// matrix. The pre-backfill state is derived per migration (today's matrix minus
// the object the backfill grants), which is why no cohort fixture is involved.
//
// So the fixture below no longer feeds a replay. It is kept because it still
// answers a question nothing else does: which objects an installation older than
// every backfill actually held.
//
// What this file still does, and all it does: own the cohort fixture, DERIVED
// from git rather than restated, because a hand-written cohort is a waiver in
// disguise — moving an object into it would silently excuse that object. What IS
// pinned, and says so below, is the pair of coordinates that reach the
// derivation.
