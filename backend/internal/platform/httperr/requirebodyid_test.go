// The SHAPE of a missing-required-id refusal, proven once.
//
// This is the half that used to be re-proven in every module: that the refusal
// is a 422, that it names the wire field, that its code is stable, and that it
// classifies — which is what decides whether the MCP tool surface reads a
// sentence an agent can act on or "the tool failed for an internal reason".
// There is one implementation now, so there is one place to assert it, and each
// module's own probe is left with the question only it can answer: is the guard
// actually called for my body.
