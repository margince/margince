// Package faulttest is the shared assertion for a refusal that must name the
// input at fault.
//
// It lives in the platform tier beside the taxonomy it reads, because the
// question it answers belongs to that taxonomy and not to any module: does this
// error classify, does it classify as the CALLER's mistake, and does it name the
// wire field they must change. Eight modules make refusals of that shape and each
// had its own copy of the check — so the rule was spelled once in production code
// and eight times in tests, which is one place to fix a defect and eight to
// forget.
