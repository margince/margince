// It exists because the alternative is a 500 telling the caller to retry, and a
// constraint breach is deterministic: the same call fails the same way forever.
// An agent following that advice burns its attempts and then escalates to a
// human for a mistake it could have fixed. storekit's own doc already states the
// rule this enforces — "a CHECK is a business rule, and a business-rule breach is
// never a server fault" — and this is the net that makes it true for the paths
// that forgot.
//
// It names no field, because at this depth the only thing that knows one is the
// CONSTRAINT NAME, and that is schema: `organization_owner_id_fkey` tells a
// caller our table and column names. A path that can name the field should
// refuse before the database does, the way checkLifecycle and checkSizeBand do —
// this answers the ones that do not, and the constraint goes to the operator's

// `owner_id` — references a USER, which no tool on this surface enumerates. It
// then sent a person id that genuinely exists and got byte-identical text back.
