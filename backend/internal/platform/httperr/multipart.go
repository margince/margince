// A body that is not multipart and a body that is too large are different
// problems with different next moves, and one message for both misdirects
// whichever caller it did not describe: a client sending well-formed multipart
// is told its framing might be wrong, and a client sending a small malformed
// body is told about a size limit it never approached. So the oversize case
// answers 413 and NAMES the limit — the one actionable fact — and everything
// else answers 422 about framing only.
//
// `limit` is the ceiling the caller applied, in bytes; pass the same value the
// MaxBytesReader was given, or the sentence describes a limit nothing enforced.

// the case that actually ships. Anything else keeps one decimal ROUNDED DOWN,
// never to nearest, because a stated limit must never exceed the enforced one:
// rounding 999,999 up to "1.0 MB" invites a 1,000,000-byte file that is then
// refused by the sentence that welcomed it. Understating by less than 0.1 MB
// costs the reader nothing; overstating by a byte costs them a whole upload.
//
// The version this replaces divided and truncated to whole MB, which read a
// 8,388,608-byte ceiling as "8 MB" — refusing an 8.2 MB file the sentence said
// would fit — and any ceiling below a megabyte as "0 MB".
