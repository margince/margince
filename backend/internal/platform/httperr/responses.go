// The ready-made refusals: the handful of responses a surface writes directly
// rather than by classifying an error it was handed.
//
// Split from httperr.go at the 500-line cap. The two halves answer different
// questions — that one asks "what does THIS error mean on the wire", this one
// is the shorthand for a refusal a handler already knows the shape of — so the
// seam is a concept rather than a line count.

// RequireBodyID refuses a required body id the caller simply omitted, naming the

//
// The defect it closes is the generator's: oapi-codegen renders a REQUIRED body
// id as a non-pointer UUID, and encoding/json leaves an absent key at the zero
// value with no error. So "required" in the contract is a claim only this check
// makes true — and what made it worth a named helper is where the zero value
// LANDS. It reaches a lookup or a link-target probe, matches no row, and comes
// back as a bare not-found: the caller is told a record it never mentioned does
// not exist, on a request whose real fault was an absent key.
//
// It lives here rather than per-module because Classify matches *DetailedError
// before anything else, so one call answers a 422 naming the field on REST AND
// the same field-named sentence on the MCP tool surface — which never runs a
// module's HTTP mapper. A module error type per caller would be a second
// spelling of a rule whose wire output is byte-identical.
