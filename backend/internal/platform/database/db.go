// DB is a pool that knows which workspace it binds — the installation's, the
// only one there is (ADR-0061/A107).
//
// It exists to take that binding OFF the request context. WithWorkspaceTx
// reads the workspace from the caller's ctx, which means every request path,
// every job and every fixture has to put it there first, and a path that
// forgets fails at the SQL rather than at the seam. ADR-0091 §9 step 3 is the
// collapse: one helper, the singleton resolved once, and the GUC still set
// from it, so RLS stays armed and the tenant-isolation suite remains the proof
// that the edit was faithful.
//
// The workspace arrives as a resolver rather than a value because bootstrap
// has not necessarily happened when the server is assembled — the worker polls
// until the API bootstraps. identity's resolver caches its first success, so
// "resolved once" is a property of that resolver, not of a package-level
// variable this type would otherwise have to own.

// transaction, and a ceiling added per call site is a ceiling the next lane
// silently does without. A store built on a bounded handle cannot grow an
// unbounded query.
//
// ZERO is the one value that cannot be a ceiling: it is the field's zero value
// on every handle nobody bounded, so it has to mean unbounded. Every other
