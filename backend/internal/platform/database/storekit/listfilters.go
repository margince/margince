// Binding a caller's `name=value` filters onto a store's list input.
//
// A record list is narrowed by a handful of typed fields, and every store
// spells the same four operand kinds — an id, a closed word, a flag, a whole
// number. Spelling
// the binding once here is what keeps the two halves of a filter inseparable:
// the NAME a surface may advertise and the FIELD that name narrows come out of
// one declaration, so a filter cannot be published by one half and dropped by
// the other. A dropped filter answers a wider question than the caller asked
// while looking exactly like an answer, which is the failure worth designing
// out rather than testing for.
//
// It is the binding, not the vocabulary: which filters exist is the contract's
// to say (each list operation's own declared parameters), and each module
// declares only how its store takes them.
