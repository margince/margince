// which guarantees person_channel_identity is never recreated — and every lane
// that could reach that row later (the erasure raw purge, the SAR raw section)
// drives off exactly those rows. Re-probing after the write narrows the window
// without closing it, because the erasure's own purge has already run by the
// time it commits. Serializing the two is the only answer that holds.

// a mail-only subject holds no channel account, so locking accounts alone makes
// the eraser take no lock at all, and an inbound message naming that subject by
// ADDRESS then serializes against nothing. It can bind a live channel account to
// the subject mid-purge; the erasure works from its pre-erasure read, so that
// binding is neither purged nor suppressed, and the account outranks the address
