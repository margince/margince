// Split from predicate.go, which compiles a filter and nothing else. That
// separation is the point rather than a filing convenience: compilation is
// scope-neutral by design, and every guard that makes a compiled filter SAFE to
// run — the object-RBAC admission, the row-scope clause, the row bound — lives
// on this side, in one place a surface cannot route around.
