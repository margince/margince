// The lead identity probes (ADR-0008 keeps leads out of person matching, so
// they carry exact keys of their own: a live email and a LinkedIn profile
// URL). Two write shapes create leads — the direct create and the
// evidence-backed capture — and they answer a hit with deliberately
// different policies: the direct create refuses with the incumbent's id,
// capture stages a merge proposal for a human. What they must NOT hold
// separately is the question itself, which is why the SQL lives here rather
// than once per module: the modules cannot import each other, and a second
// copy of "is this identity already claimed" is how the two drifted apart
// before (a LinkedIn URL was probed by neither).
//
// This is the same seam EmailSuppressed already occupies — a tx-carrying
// predicate that both people and capture call.
