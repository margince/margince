package storekit

// The canonical typed AND/OR predicate engine (B-E15.10a/b, features/10
// §3): the ONE filter representation behind lists, saved views, dynamic
// lists, filtered export, and NL→filter. A predicate is a tree of
// AND/OR groups over typed leaves; each leaf names a field from the
// caller's closed vocabulary (the data-model §13.5 per-resource
// allow-list — the caller passes it as a map, exactly like the report
// engine's reportSpec), an operator from the fixed DSL set
// (eq,neq,gt,lt,gte,lte,in,contains,exists — B-E15.10a acceptance; no
// new grammar), and a value validated against the field's type. Every
// identifier that reaches the query text comes from the vocabulary map;
// every value travels as a bind parameter.
//
// It lives in storekit because modules (people, deals, …) and compose
// both consume it, and the DAG only lets platform sit under both.
//
// This file COMPILES a filter and nothing else, which is why it reaches
// for neither the database nor auth. Compilation is scope-neutral by
// design: it renders the caller's filter and NOTHING more, so a caller
// MUST AND the result with their row-scope clause
// (auth.ScopeClauseFor). Nobody does that by hand — the Query executor
// in query.go composes it, along with the object-RBAC admission and the
// row bound, so surface code cannot forget any of the three.
