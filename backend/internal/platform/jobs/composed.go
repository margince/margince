// The extension tier's half of the declaration table.
//
// specs_gen.go is CLOSED: it is compiled from backend/api/jobs.yaml, it is
// committed, and it is drift-gated, so it must be byte-identical on every
// installation. An extension's kinds cannot live there — a composed
// installation would then have a different generated file from the vanilla one
// and the gate would fail on every build that enabled a unit.
//
// So the composed kinds arrive at RUN time, through this seam, from the
// generated composition module (which re-emits them as literals). Everything
// the running system asks the declaration — SpecFor, Declared, MustBeTotal —
// answers over both tables, so a composed kind is as declared as a core one and
// River's silent one-minute default is no more reachable for one than for the
// other.
//
// The seam is deliberately NARROW in the one direction that matters: it accepts
// nothing outside the ext_ namespace and it refuses to shadow a core kind. A
// registration surface that could redefine `send_email` would be a way to
// change a core job's wall clock from a directory an installation dropped in.
