// the raw cause is the one thing that may not travel this way. It goes to
// the log, where the audience and the retention are the operator's own.

// The bounds a requested postponement is held to before it reaches the queue.
//
// A delay is a REQUEST from a unit, exactly as a class is, and this is the half
// of the seam that makes the request safe to honour.
//
// WHAT THE CEILING PROTECTS, said precisely, because the imprecise version is
// checkably false: a postponed row is `scheduled`, and `scheduled` IS counted —
// health.go's waitingStates and the queue-depth gauge both include it, so a row
// postponed for a year still shows up as one piece of waiting work. What it
// escapes is the AGE reading. Every "how long has this waited" measurement in
// this package filters `scheduled_at <= now()`, correctly, because nothing
// scheduled for the future is late — so a far-future delay produces a count
// nobody can age, forever, and "waiting: 1" is what a healthy idle tick looks
// like too. The ceiling keeps the delay inside the window where a stuck
// postponement eventually becomes measurable instead of permanently plausible.
//
// The floor carries two jobs. River PANICS on a negative duration, so a unit
// that computed one from a clock — a deadline already past, a subtraction that
// went the wrong way — would take the worker process down rather than fail a
// tick, and a bound is the only place that can be caught once for everybody.
// Zero is not a panic but is River's "run me immediately", which for a failing
// tick is a spin against a provider that is already refusing; a second is long
// enough not to be one and short enough that no unit meaning "as soon as
// possible" is meaningfully denied.
//
// A CALLER STAYING UNDER THE CEILING IS NOT LEFT TO PROSE. It used to say the
// ceiling "sits well above any cadence a connector declares", which was a claim
// about one day's tree that nothing enforced — and it hid the inversion it was
// meant to reassure about, since a unit declaring a cadence above this bound
// reconciles its delay against that cadence perfectly and then gets clamped to
// less, polling a refusing provider harder during an outage than in health.
// backend/gates/pollcadenceparity_test.go reads this bound out of this file and holds
