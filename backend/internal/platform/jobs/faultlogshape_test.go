// WHAT THE FAULT LOG LINE CARRIES, held as a shape rather than as a substring.
//
// This line is the one place the cause is allowed to be detailed: the stored
// sentence is fixed because river_job.errors is unscoped and fleet-visible, and
// the process log is the other half of that trade — its audience and its
// retention are the operator's own. So the whole diagnosis rests here, and for
// two dispositions it rests here ALONE. An unclassified failure stores a sentence
// saying only that the diagnosis is in the process log, and a postponement makes
// River record no attempt error at all.
//
// A collector is what reads it, which is why the cases below decode the record
// instead of grepping it. "The cause reached the log" is already asserted
// elsewhere by substring; what those cases cannot see is a field that stopped
// being a field.
