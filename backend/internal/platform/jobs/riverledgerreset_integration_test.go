package jobs_test

// The mirror of testdb's own ledger gate, for River's.
//
// testdb.Reset used to EMPTY river_migration while River's tables stood — a
// state River reads as "not migrated", so it replays its first migration onto
// tables that already exist and fails on SQLSTATE 42P07. resetTables excludes it
// now, beside schema_migrations_%, for the reason a ledger is not test data.
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS RATHER THAN THE SCOPE TEST ALREADY IN testdb: that one
// compares in ONE direction — it reports relations the reset FAILS to cover, and
// says nothing about scope that is wrongly present. Its independent census
// carries the same exclusion, so the two cannot disagree either. Delete
// `c.relname <> 'river_migration'` from resetTables as redundant-looking and
// every test in this repository still passes, because testdb/river.go probes the
// TABLE and never the ledger — the damage surfaces only in whichever migrator
// later reads it. Nothing else fails, so this is the thing that must.
//
// It lives in package jobs because this is where River's schema is applied
// through the real migrator; asserting it in testdb would mean testdb's own
// tests reaching for River, which is the import EnsureRiverSchema takes a
// function parameter to avoid.
