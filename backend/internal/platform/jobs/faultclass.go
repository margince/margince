// The composed half of the fault vocabulary: the failure classes this
// installation's extension units declare, and the read that turns a stored
// sentence back into the class and remedy an operator acts on.
//
// fault.go is the core half. The two are deliberately the same shape — a token,
// a sentence, a remedy — because they are rendered by one surface, and an
// operator should not be able to tell from a failure list which tier classified
// it.
//
// IT LIVES BESIDE THE COMPOSED KIND TABLE, not inside it, and the reason is the
// same one composed.go gives for existing at all: an extension's declarations
// cannot be compiled into this package. What is new is only that a unit
// declares a VOCABULARY as well as a set of kinds.
//
// WHAT IS NOT NEW is the wire format. A stored failure is still nothing but a
// vetted sentence — no class prefix, no envelope — so every row written before
// this file existed still vets, and a row written by a unit still vets on a build
// that dropped it. The class is DERIVED on read from the row's kind, which is
// what makes the sentence alone unambiguous: two units may name the same failure
// in the same words, and the kind says whose failure it was.

// unique — only unique within a kind, which is a rule about one unit's own
// declaration and so a rule that unit can keep by itself.
//
// KEYED THEN BY SENTENCE because the sentence is what the row stores, and a read
// starts from the row. See the file header for why the wire carries no class.

//     classified failure present as the sentence the product uses when it has
//     nothing to say — and worse, present it WITH a class, while a genuine
//     unclassifiable failure shows the identical text without one. Each substitute
//     must keep meaning exactly what it says, so all three are refused rather than
//     only the one this seam happens to sit next to.
