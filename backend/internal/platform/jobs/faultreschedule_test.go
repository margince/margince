// The disposition half of the fault seam: whether a classified failure FAILS the
// tick or postpones it.
//
// These cases exist because the two answers are indistinguishable in the type
// system — both are an `error` a worker returns — and completely different to an
// operator. A failure spends the child's attempts and becomes dead work on the
// Maintenance screen; a postponement reschedules the same row and shows nobody
// anything. Returning the wrong one either fills a screen with alarms nobody can
// act on, or hides an outage somebody has to.
