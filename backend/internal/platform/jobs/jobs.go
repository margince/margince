// Package jobs owns the River client lifecycle — the durable
// background-job substrate, the peer of platform/events for the outbox —
// and the DECLARATION every job kind is built from: the Spec table
// compiled from backend/api/jobs.yaml, which holds each kind's role,
// queue, timeout, attempt cap, fan-out edge and registration posture.
//
// Declaration and wiring are split on purpose, and the split is the whole
// design: this package says what a kind IS, and the composition layer
// still assembles the runner — it supplies the queue set, constructs the
// workers, and schedules the periodic jobs. So platform never learns what
// a worker does.
//
// The declaration is what the runtime OBEYS for the timeout of every job
// registered THROUGH Govern: it wraps a worker in a type River reaches
// only through Work, so that worker cannot answer for its own wall clock.
//
// Registration is bound too, and the binding lives one layer up: the
// composition layer registers only through a generated function whose type
// parameter is the closed set of DECLARED args types, so a kind
// api/jobs.yaml has never heard of does not compile, and forbidigo refuses
// every direct River registration — AddWorker, AddWorkerArgs and
// AddWorkerSafely alike — that would go around it. Neither gate reaches a
// fixture registering into a throwaway *river.Workers, and neither would
// notice a hand-edited generated union, which is what MustBeTotal is for: it
// names any registered kind the file does not declare, and the runner refuses
// to boot rather than working it at River's silent one-minute default.
//
// It owns no domain either way. The boundary with the bus is deliberate:
// an event announces that something happened (outbox); a job asks for
// work to be done (here).
