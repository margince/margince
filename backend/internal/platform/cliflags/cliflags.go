// Package cliflags registers command-line flags whose value may come from the
// environment, and applies the environment only where the flag was not given.
//
// It exists because `flag` echoes a non-empty default in its usage output as
// `(default "…")`. Wiring os.Getenv straight into a flag's default therefore puts
// whatever the environment supplied into the usage text, and every binary here
// prints that text on a mistyped flag or `-h`. The values in question are DSNs,
// signing keys, OAuth client secrets and bearer tokens; on CI that stderr is a
// public build log, and in a container it is the pod's log stream.
//
// Registering the LITERAL default and resolving the environment after Parse keeps
// the value out of the usage text while leaving the precedence unchanged: an
// explicit flag still wins over the environment, which still wins over the
// literal.
//
// The obligation is derived, not maintained: each binary asserts that its own
// usage output contains no value from any MARGINCE_* variable it reads, so a flag
// added later cannot quietly reintroduce the leak by being left off a list.
