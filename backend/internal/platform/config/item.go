package config

// What an installation can configure, declared as data rather than discovered
// by grep.
//
// The names alone were already enumerable — envcontract_test.go finds every
// MARGINCE_* literal in the tree and demands a row in configuration.md. What
// that cannot see is everything ELSE a generator needs: whether a value is a
// duration or a count, what it defaults to, whether it is a secret that must
// never be echoed, which process role reads it, and what it is for. Those live
// in prose today, which is why the prose and the code drift.
//
// So each package declares its own items beside the code that reads them, and
// each cmd/<role> assembles the ones it wires. A central list of sixty is the
// "list to maintain" this repo's second review rule warns about; sixty
// declarations next to sixty readers is not.
