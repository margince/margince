// THE SetDefault IS THE POINT, and it is what a role that only built a logger
// was missing. Plenty of code in this tree logs through the PACKAGE-LEVEL
// slog functions — slog.ErrorContext, slog.WarnContext — which reach
// slog.Default() and nothing else. jobs.faultFor is the case that matters
// most: a postponed tick records no attempt error anywhere, so its log line
// and the unit's own row are the entire trail an outage leaves in the process.
// Until a role installed its handler here, that line went to the stdlib
// default — text, on stderr — while every explicitly-logged line went to the
// operator's configured sink and format. A collector parsing the worker's JSON
// got an unstructured line for exactly the events it most wants, and nothing
// anywhere said so.
//
// It is also what makes the CORRELATION handler reach those call sites. The
// wrapper below enriches a record only when it is the handler doing the
// logging, so a package-level call against a bare default carried no
// correlation_id whichever context it was given — which is why fault.go used
// to attach the id by hand, and why it no longer has to.
