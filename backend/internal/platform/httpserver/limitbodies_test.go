// answers the tight one whenever nobody said otherwise.
//
// Only a request can observe an effective ceiling. A handler's own
// MaxBytesReader cannot widen a body this middleware already bounded, so a
// declared cap above its ceiling is a cap that never runs — and nothing in the
// tree can see that, because the constant, the wrap and the message are all
// individually correct.

// the only place the effective ceiling is observable.
