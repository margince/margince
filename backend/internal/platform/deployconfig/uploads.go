// each route that accepts a file (OPS-CFG-12, DOC-PARAM-11).
//
// It sits in its own file for the same reason overlay_budget does — it is a
// section with arithmetic of its own, defaults to merge and bounds to enforce,
// rather than values to hand on.
//
// What this section does NOT decide: which routes may carry a file. That list
// is a source-level declaration in the composition layer, and it is the whole
// security property — several handlers decode the body with no bound of their
// own and two of those routes are unauthenticated, so a route that carries no
// file must stay unable to obtain the file bound by claiming a media type. An
// operator chooses the number; nobody chooses the list at run time.

// refuses every upload and is far more likely a mistake than an intention. It
