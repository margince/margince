// The file layer of OPS-CFG-1 is two files, not one.
//
// A deployment posture changes a handful of keys and shares the rest. Before
// this, the two ways to express that were both bad: keep a whole second copy of
// the configuration per posture and let them drift, or have a script append
// text to the file at boot — which is what `make dev` did to arm the data
// reset, so the dev stack's most destructive capability was turned on by a
// shell heredoc that no review ever saw as a diff.
//
// So the base file states what the installation IS, and an overlay beside it
// states what THIS POSTURE changes:
//
//	config/margince.yaml       every installation
//	config/margince.dev.yaml   what a dev stack does differently
//
// Within the file layer the overlay wins; the whole file layer still sits
// between compiled defaults and the environment, exactly where OPS-CFG-1 puts
// it. The full order, unchanged by this file:
//
//	compiled defaults -> margince.yaml -> margince.<posture>.yaml -> env -> flags
//
// How a key merges is legible from the YAML in front of the operator, which is
// the property that makes a two-file layer safe to reason about:
//
//	a scalar   the overlay's value replaces the base's
//	a mapping  merges key by key, so an overlay adds a provider without
//	           restating the ones the base already names
//	a list     replaces entirely, because half a list is not a list — an
//	           overlay naming [SEK] means SEK, not "USD, GBP, CHF and SEK"
//
// The consequence worth knowing: an overlay can add a mapping key and can
// change one, but cannot REMOVE one. A posture that must not have a key removes
// it from the base and adds it to the postures that want it.
