// consumption-meter configuration, its built-in defaults, and the load-time
// safety check that keeps a misconfigured cap from overrunning a quota this

// OverlayBudget is the per-incumbent OVB consumption-meter configuration
// (overlay-budget chapter): keyed by incumbent name (e.g. "hubspot"), each
// entry pins that incumbent's two windows' ceilings/caps and the shared
// warn/shed fractions. An incumbent with no entry falls back to the
// built-in default (defaultIncumbentBudgets) so an installation that never
// wrote the block still meters HubSpot safely rather than fail-closing
// every force-fresh read. The numeric values are unpinned upstream (the
// corpus leaves per-incumbent calibration open, OVB Parameters appendix);
// these are this build's conservative defaults, tunable here.

// of the cap (OVB-PARAM-1/2) shared by both windows.
