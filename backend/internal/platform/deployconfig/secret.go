// A secret names where its value lives; it never IS the value.
//
// OPS-CFG-3: no configuration layer holds a secret's value, only a reference to
// one. This file is the mechanism — and the reason it is a mechanism rather
// than a convention is that margince.yaml is the most-read and most-pasted
// artefact an installation has. It goes in tickets, in chat, in a screenshot of
// a terminal. A password that can be written there eventually is.
//
// So a secret field REFUSES a literal, at decode time, before anything runs.
// Not "discouraged" — refused, with the field named, because the failure this
// prevents is silent and permanent: nobody notices a working installation whose
// credential is also in a support thread.
//
// Two forms, and they are not equally compliant:
//
//	${file:/run/secrets/name}   the mounted file IS the secret store — a
//	                            Kubernetes Secret, a Docker secret, a vault
//	                            projection. Fully OPS-CFG-3.
//	${env:MARGINCE_NAME}        keeps the value out of the FILE, but leaves it
//	                            in the environment layer, which OPS-CFG-3 names
//	                            alongside files and flags. A deliberate,
//	                            bounded transitional form — the universal
//	                            container pattern, and what every secret in this
//	                            repo does today — not a claim of compliance.
//
// The distinction is written down here rather than left for an operator to
// infer, because "both are supported" and "both are equivalent" are different
// sentences and only the first is true.
