// Package overlaybudget is the OVB per-incumbent consumption meter
// (overlay-budget subsystem): a first-class, server-side budget for an
// incumbent CRM's API allocation, metered from OUR OWN call counts. It
// keeps overlay traffic a conservative, truthful distance below a rate
// ceiling we share with integrations we can't see, and never fabricates
// the headroom it can't account for.
//
// It lives in the platform layer and imports nothing from modules/compose
// (ADR-0014). Overlay adapters (the module) charge it and degrade on its
// answer; the admin budget surface reads its snapshot.
//
// Storage: Redis fixed-window counters with expiry, keyed per workspace +
// incumbent + window (+ per-source for the REST window). Two rolling
// windows per incumbent connection:
//
//   - Search (per-second): the burst limiter over the incumbent's
//     per-second Search-API ceiling. The poller RESERVES a slot before each
//     search request and paces itself when the window sheds, so we never
//     trip the incumbent's per-second 429.
//   - REST (daily): the day's allocation. force-fresh reads RESERVE against
//     it (degrading to mirror-with-staleness on shed, AC-OV-7); the poller
//     CONSUMES against it unconditionally (an incumbent it must mirror is
//     not something to refuse partway — but its spend is still counted).
//     Every REST charge is attributed to a source and the per-source
//     breakdown sums exactly to the REST total (OVB-AC-5).
//
// Headroom against the published ceiling is inherently `~unknown`: we meter
// 100% of our own calls, but foreign integrations sharing the ceiling are
// invisible to us, so the remaining headroom can never be attributed
// (OVB-AC-1 / OVB-PARAM-5) — the meter reports our own consumption and the
// band, never an invented headroom number.
//
// Fail-closed: with no Redis (nil client, unreachable, or a scripting
// error) or no configured incumbent, the meter answers shed / declines
// every reservation — it never invents headroom it cannot account for.
