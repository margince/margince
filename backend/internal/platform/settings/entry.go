// Package settings is the installation-settings mechanism (ADR-0090/A135):
// one `setting` table holding one row per setting, with the CATALOG in typed
// Go rather than in the schema. The table is persistence; this package owns
// what a setting is.
//
// The split matters. Adding a setting used to cost an ALTER TABLE on
// `workspace` plus an RBAC backfill (0121_capture_auto_enrich, for one
// boolean). Here it costs an Entry — and because the Entry carries its own
// validator, RBAC object and audit verb, none of the governance the column
// form gave up is lost: per-setting audit verbs stay per-setting, and the
// object that gated the column still gates the row.
//
// This package owns the mechanism and no domain. It never learns what a
// currency or a deal is: validators are supplied by the module that owns the
// setting, and compose assembles them (shared → platform → modules →
// compose).
