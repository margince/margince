// It exists because "which customers are near Stuttgart" is a question the
// query surface could parse and not answer: within_radius was in the grammar
// and every plan carrying it came back unavailable, because no row had
// coordinates to compare.
//
// ONE PROVIDER TODAY, and the interface is what keeps that from hardening.

// policy this package takes seriously rather than works around. A self-hosted
// instance is the same client with a different base URL.
