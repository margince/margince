// The question a human is asked when an agent crosses a releasable threshold,
// and the answer that widens the window.
//
// It lives HERE, in the package that owns the counters, because two modules read
// it and neither may import the other: the tool surface writes one when the gate
// refuses a call, and the approvals engine reads it back when the human says
// continue. A struct per side would be two spellings of one stored document, and
// the day they disagree is the day a human's yes releases a counter they were
// never shown.

// ReleaseProposal is the staged proposal's payload: what the agent has spent,
// against what, in which window.
//
// Observed and Limit are the sentence the approval screen shows — "this agent
// has been handed 2,431 of its 2,000 records for this window; continue?" — and
// they are stored rather than re-read at decision time on purpose. The human
// answers the question they were ASKED; re-reading the counter would let the
// number move between the asking and the answering, and the release would then
// be granted against a figure nobody saw.
