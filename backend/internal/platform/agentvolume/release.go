// Release grants one more allowance of counter c to passport, in the window
// named by bucket, and reports whether it applied.
//
// IT TAKES ITS SUBJECT EXPLICITLY rather than reading the context, and that is
// the whole shape of this call. Every other method here meters the caller; this
// one is invoked by the HUMAN who lent the passport, from an approval decision,
// and the agent whose window is widened is nowhere near that request. A version
// that read ctx would silently release the approver's own counter — which is not
// metered at all, so it would appear to work and do nothing.
//
// It applies only to a RELEASABLE counter (BYO-STEP-1 and -2). Egress and calls
// are hard stops the spec ends with the window, and cost refuses nothing, so
// there is nothing there to release; a request to release one is a defect in the
// caller, answered as an error rather than as a quiet success.
//
// It applies only to the CURRENT window. A release names the bucket the human
// was shown, so an approval answered after that window rolled applies to
// nothing — correctly: the counter it would have widened is already back at
// zero, and the agent it was granted for is no longer refused. Reporting that as
// `applied == false` lets the decision path say so instead of claiming an effect
// it did not have. A bucket in the FUTURE is refused for the opposite reason: it
// would pre-authorize a window nobody has looked at, and the payload a release
// reads is editable before it is approved.
