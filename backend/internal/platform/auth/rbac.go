// the MCP tool surface — rides the same enforcement path (architecture/06:
// no agent bypass; ADR-0054 §8: authorization is platform policy, not a
// domain module). This file is the admission question "may this principal
// touch this KIND of record", answered with ErrPermissionDenied (403);
// rowscope.go answers "which ROWS", with ErrNotFound so existence is never
// disclosed. Together they are the ONE admission point every store rides.
