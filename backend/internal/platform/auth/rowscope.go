// re-check: a waiter wakes on the archived row and the liveness filter refuses
// it, rather than acting on what it read before waiting.
//
// FOR SHARE, and the pairing is the point. It conflicts with the archive, which
// UPDATEs the row, while two references onto one record do not conflict and have
// no reason to queue behind each other — a person mid-ingest is referenced by

// takes on the activity it is about (migration 1788000100).
