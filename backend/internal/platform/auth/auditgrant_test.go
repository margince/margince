// The audit attribution gate as a fitness function. Every mutation writes
// audit_log.authorization_rule from AuthzRule, which renders "which rule
// allowed this" by looking the verb up in auditActionGrant. A verb missing
// from that map renders the EMPTY string, and audit_log.authorization_rule is
// nullable text — so the blank is accepted silently and the accountability
// answer is gone for good once the acting role's policy is edited or the role
// deleted. That is how advance_phase (migration 0133) shipped writing blank
// attribution on every project phase change, while its sibling advance_stage
// rendered correctly.
//
// The obligation is DERIVED, not restated: the vocabulary comes from the
// highest-numbered migration that states audit_log_action_check, so the next
// widening migration fails here instead of writing blanks. Verbs no governed
// principal writes are declared in auditVerbNoGrant with a reason, and that
// waiver is a ratchet — a waived verb must still be in the vocabulary and must
// NOT have a grant.
