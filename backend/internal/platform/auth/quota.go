// The quantitative third of "scope ∧ tier ∧ quota" (interfaces.md §2), and the
// §2.4 ladder's refusing half.
//
// The first two terms are BOOLEAN — may this caller run this verb at all — and
// they are the only ones that catch an agent doing something it was never
// allowed to do. This one is the only one that catches an agent doing something
// it IS allowed to do, at a volume nobody intended (api-rate-limits §2.5). It is
// why an in-scope, correctly-tiered, read-only Passport reading the whole
// workspace is a gated event rather than a Tuesday.
//
// This half only ever REFUSES. Nothing here charges a counter: the surface pays
// where records and effects leave it (modules/agents), and a gate that could
// both admit and charge could admit itself.

// hard stop does not. A caller matching on prose would eventually stage a
// release for a quota nothing can release.

// refuseOnQuota applies every volume bound one tool call is subject to, and
// answers the first one it crosses.
//
// CALLS IS ASKED FIRST, and the order is a decision. It is the ceiling every
// other quota sits under (BYO-STEP-4's suspension), so a Passport that has
// crossed it is refused for every verb — and answering the per-kind quota
// instead would tell a suspended caller which of its allowances still has
// headroom, which is a map of what to spend next.
//
// Then the counter the call itself belongs to, DERIVED from the spec rather
// than listed, by the same function the charge point uses (agentquota.CounterFor).
// One derivation means the quota that refuses and the quota that is paid can
// never be two different quotas.
// AdmitReplay is the admission a RECORDED answer takes before it is served
// again. It is the volume half of Admit and nothing else, and each omission is
// deliberate rather than an economy:
//
//   - SCOPE and TIER are not re-asked because a replay makes no new call. Worse,
//     asking would break the thing it is meant to protect: a confirm-first tool
//     answers ErrRequiresApproval to every Admit, so a full admission would
//     refuse to re-serve the receipt of an act a human already approved.
//   - The SEAT and the granting human's RBAC bind where they always did — the
//     records are re-read live through the datasource seam, which is what
//     applies object grants and row scope.
//   - REVOCATION binds one layer up: the transport re-authenticates the
//     passport on every exchange.
//
// What is left is the part nothing else re-asks: the ceilings. A passport past
// its call ceiling is refused for every verb, and a receipt is a verb — without
// this, a suspended caller could keep drawing record documents out of answers it
// produced before the ceiling closed.
