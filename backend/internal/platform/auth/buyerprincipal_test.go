// A buyer principal is ATTRIBUTED and never ADMITTED: it names an external
// person in one Deal Room so the audit log can say who acted, and it carries no
// authority of its own. Every gate in this package must refuse it.
//
// The refusal has to hold for a reason stronger than "a buyer happens to hold
// no permissions". A test that hands the gate a zero Permissions value proves
// only that the zero value grants nothing — it passes identically for a
// connector, and it would keep passing if the buyer kind were deleted. So the
// buyer here is given MAXIMAL authority: every object, every action, row scope
// all, and the admin role key. What refuses it is the kind, or nothing does.
