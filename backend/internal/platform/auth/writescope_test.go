// The read/write asymmetry of a manual grant, as the predicates SPELL it.
//
// record_grant.access has carried two levels since 0011 and the schema has
// always said "write satisfies read" — but nothing read the column, so a `read`
// share widened a mutation exactly as far as a `write` one. These tests pin the
// two halves that make the distinction real, and they are deliberately a pair:
// asserting only that the write arm reads `access` would pass just as well if
// the visibility arm had been narrowed too, which would break sharing instead
// of fixing it.
