// The activity_link visibility rules. An activity has no owner of its own —
// its free-text inherits the sensitivity of the records it attaches to — so
// two different questions are answered from the same disjunction, and both
// live here so they cannot drift apart (ADR-0054 §8: scope policy has
// exactly one spelling).
//
//   - MAY I READ THIS ACTIVITY: yes if ANY of its links points at a record
//     I can see (ActivityDiscoverClause, inheritedscope.go), and MAY I
//     READ IT when its audience is limited (ActivityContentClause).
//   - MAY I BE TOLD WHAT IT IS ABOUT: per link, because the any-link answer
//     above does not license disclosing the other records it touches.

// LinkTargetVisibleClause answers, for ONE activity_link row, whether the
// record it points at is visible under the caller's row scope. An empty
// string means a caller for whom every target is visible — which, since
// person and organization carry capture privacy, is the system principal
// alone.
//
// It exists because "may I read this activity" and "may I be told what this
// activity is about" are different questions. The activity gate above is an
// ANY-link rule: an activity reachable through one visible person is
// readable in full. Projecting its link rows back to the client would then
// hand over the ids of the OTHER records it touches — a colleague's deal,
// say — which the caller may not read. So the projection carries its own
// per-row predicate, built from the same disjunction the gate uses, because
// scope policy has exactly one spelling (ADR-0054 §8).
//
// alias names the activity_link table in the caller's query.
