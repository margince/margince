// GetOn's whole reason for existing is WHICH CONNECTION the read lands on, and
// that is not a claim the memory provider can carry: its GetOn ignores the
// querier entirely, so a local provider quietly regressed back to `v.pool`
// would pass every test in this package's unit suite while reintroducing the
// deadlock the method was added to remove — a caller inside a transaction
// holding one pooled connection and waiting for a second.
//
// So this exercises the local provider over a real pool, and pins the property
// behaviourally rather than by inspection: with the pool narrowed to ONE
// connection and that connection held by an open transaction, a GetOn through
// the transaction must answer. A GetOn that took its own connection cannot pass
// this.
//
// The control below then shows Get is not that — and it does so by COUNTING the
// pool's acquires, not by waiting for a deadline to expire. "Get must fail"
// would be the easier sentence and it is no longer what happens: the test hands
// the connection back and Get completes. Anyone reintroducing a wait here would
// be putting back the two seconds this shape exists to remove.
