// Package keyvault owns secret-material storage behind an opaque,
// workspace-scoped Ref. It is a peer of platform/events and platform/jobs:
// technical plumbing that owns no domain. The DB row stays the system of
// record and the tenant anchor; the vault is custodian of the secret bytes
// only, addressed by a Ref that a domain row (e.g.
// capture_connection.credential_ref) carries in place of the raw
// credential. Isolation is a property of the Ref: a Ref minted for one
// workspace does not resolve under another, so a stolen Ref is inert across
// the tenant edge without also defeating RLS on the row that names it.
//
// Secret hygiene is the load-bearing rule here: the plaintext and the root
// key never reach a log line, an error message, or a model-bound payload.
// Every error names the Ref, never the secret. This composes with — it does
// not replace — model.SecretStripper, which keeps secrets out of model-bound
// payloads at egress; the vault is where secrets live at rest.
