// CleanupTimeout bounds every credential delete that runs outside a request's

// the worker that started it indefinitely.
const CleanupTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// DeleteDetached removes a credential that a COMMITTED lifecycle change left
// unreferenced: the superseded blob after a reconnect re-pointed a row at a
// fresh one, the revoked blob after a disconnect.
//
// It never fails its caller. The lifecycle change is already authoritative and
// the caller has nothing to undo; worse, a retry could never re-attempt this
// delete (a second disconnect finds no live row, a second reconnect finds no
// superseded ref), so failing here would misreport a change that DID happen AND
// strand the blob anyway. On failure it logs at ERROR for operational cleanup
// instead: the blob is inert — unreferenced, encrypted at rest — and ref is a
// vault key, never the secret, so it is safe to log.
//
// The delete runs AFTER its transaction commits, which means it must OUTLIVE
// the request. ctx is the caller's cancellable request context; a client that
// hangs up the moment it has its response would otherwise cancel this cleanup
// before it starts, stranding the blob on every such call. So the vault sees a
// context detached from that cancellation (context.WithoutCancel) under its own
// CleanupTimeout deadline.
//
// A nil vault is a wiring fault, not a reason to stay quiet: something holds a
// ref that no configured custodian can destroy, and only a log line will ever
// surface it.
