// Package testdb is the integration lane's fast schema-reset helper. The
// integration suites need a clean database per test, and the obvious way to get
// one — DROP SCHEMA + re-run every embedded migration on each Setup — dominated
// the lane: the heaviest package alone remigrated ~180 times (~0.8s each). This
// package splits the cost. EnsureSchema brings the database to head ONCE per
// test-binary process and records the empty schema's physical size; every later
// test in that process rides the already-migrated schema and only resets the
// data. Correctness holds because no migration seeds reference data a test
// depends on — the only data-touching migration (person_social backfill) is a
// no-op on an empty database.
//
// Once per process is still not the same as once per RUN, and most of the time
// it need not be either: the lane gives each package a file copy of an
// already-migrated template, so the rebuild it used to perform reproduced a
// schema it had just been handed. EnsureSchema now proves the copy is this
// binary's own head and still empty, and skips the rebuild when it is — see
// headprobe.go, which states what each proof is for.
//
// Emptying rows does not revert schema changes, so the reset also drops the
// runtime cf_ columns the customfields engine adds — see dropCustomFieldColumns.
//
// The reset stays safe under the lane's -p 1: within a package process tests
// run serially, so nothing races the shared connection between Reset and the
// next test. That covers tests, not goroutines a test leaves running — the
// DELETE batch takes row locks rather than TRUNCATE's whole-table ones, so a
// straggling writer is no longer locked out, and a suite that leaks one must
// stop it in cleanup. Across packages, each go-test binary is its own process (and, under
// the parallel runner, its own throwaway database), so migrateOnce is genuinely
// per-database.

// resetTables is the ONE spelling of which relations a reset acts on: ordinary
// tables in the schemas below, minus every MIGRATION LEDGER and the
// boot-seeded reference-data tables. All are preserved for the same reason:
// EnsureSchema's once-per-process contract assumes what its own package doc
// once stated as an invariant — "no migration seeds reference data a test
// depends on" — and migration 0240 was the first to break that assumption
// (activity_kind, channel_provider: DESIGN-SP4 §4; the lead_source and
// lead_disqualify_reason vocabularies and the field_mask seed since).
//
// currency_minor_digits is the same shape and the newest member: a migration
// seeds the codes whose minor unit is not two, and SQL money conversions read
// it. Emptied, every foreign amount silently converts at two digits, which is
// right for most currencies and a hundredfold wrong for a yen one — a reset
// that un-seeded it would make the money tests pass or fail by which test ran
// first. A reset that DELETEd them
// would silently un-seed every test's fixed activity kinds and telegram's
// channel-provider row, and the failure would surface somewhere else entirely
// — a foreign-key violation on an activity insert with no visible connection
// to Reset. Re-running dbmigrate.Up in a later process (parallel runner, fresh
// clone) must still see an unmigrated database, while a reset leaves both the
// migration ledger AND this boot-seeded reference data intact for the current
// one. Every caller selects a qualified identifier from it, so the emitted
// statements never depend on search_path resolution.
//
// river_migration is a ledger too, and is excluded for exactly the reason
// schema_migrations_* is: it records which migrations a database applied, not
// anything a test wrote. Emptying it left River's ledger disagreeing with
// River's own tables, which still stood — a state River reads as "not migrated"
// and then fails on SQLSTATE 42P07 when it replays its first migration onto
// them. testdb/river.go had to probe the TABLE to work around that; with the
// ledger preserved the two agree, and an already-migrated clone carries no rows
// that EnsureSchema's emptiness proof has to make an exception for.
//
// ext is in scope for exactly the reason public is. Since 0202 every extension
// unit's tables live there (ADR-0069), applied by the same lane, and an ext_
// table left out of this fragment is one no reset ever empties: the rows an
// integration test writes through a unit survive into every later test in the
// process, and the failure surfaces somewhere else entirely as a flake. The
// omission is invisible while extensions/ is empty, which is precisely why it is
// closed BEFORE the first unit ships tables rather than after.
