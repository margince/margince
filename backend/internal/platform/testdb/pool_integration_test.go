// The shared pool is the one every RLS and authz suite reads through, so what it
// must not become is a second pool constructor that drifts from the one cmd/api
// opens. It builds through database.NewPool and names its differences as DSN
// parameters; these tests are what keeps that true, because the ways it can stop
// being true are all silent.

// TestSharedPoolKeepsTheProductionConnectionSetup checks the two halves of
// database.NewPool's per-connection setup that a hand-built pgxpool config
// silently drops — as an earlier revision of this pool did.
//
// The two halves fail differently, and only one of them is the detector.
// Mutation-tested by rebuilding the pool from a bare pgxpool.ParseConfig: the jit
// assertion goes red, the typed-id slice bind stays green. That is not a weak
// assertion, it is what the exec mode does — the pool runs describe_exec, where
// the parameter OID always arrives from the server, so pgx never has to consult
// the registered type to encode []ids.PersonID. The bind is here to pin the idiom
// itself: pgx's exec and simple_protocol modes infer parameter types from the Go
// values instead, and would fail on this slice, so a future change of mode meets
// this test rather than a record store. jit is the half that catches the
// construction regressing.
