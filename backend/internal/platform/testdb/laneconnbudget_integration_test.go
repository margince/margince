// The lane's connection budget, asserted against the cluster the lane is
// ACTUALLY running on rather than against the committed compose file.
//
// backend/laneconnbudget_test.go already gates the committed configuration in
// `make check`, and that is the gate a pull request meets. It cannot see the one
// failure mode that costs an afternoon: a container started before the compose
// file changed. Postgres applies max_connections at startup, so a cluster left
// up from an earlier checkout serves the old ceiling while every file in the
// tree says otherwise — the same shape as an api binary still serving :8080
// from a previous branch, and just as indistinguishable from a broken change.
//
// So this reads the live setting and the budget the lane computed for THIS run,
// and fails while the run is still explainable.
//
// Neither test skips. Every lane that runs integration tests declares the budget
// through scripts/lib-testdb.sh's declare_lane_budget — the parallel lane with
// its concurrency, the one-package and serial lanes with 1 — so an absent
// variable means the harness was reached by a route that did not size the
// cluster, and that is a setup failure of exactly the kind sharedAppPool already
// refuses for the DSNs. A skipped capacity check reads exactly like a passing
// one; the serial lane makes the point concrete by failing outright on any SKIP.
