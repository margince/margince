// whole safety of the skip. Two callers inside the lane reach EnsureSchema
// with a database that is NOT the package's clone:
//
//   - make test-integration-serial runs every package against margince_test
//     ITSELF, the template each clone is copied from. Skipping the rebuild
//     there lets one package's residue persist into the template and get
//     file-copied into every later clone.
//   - tools/extmigrategate creates its own throwaway database mid-process and
//     migrates it through EnsureSchema, DEPENDING on the rebuild to strip the
//     lane clone's extension objects — its file comment states that as the
//     gate's premise.
//
// A boolean inherited from the lane's environment would have let the skip run
// in both. Comparing the name against current_database() refuses any database
// this process was not handed, and costs nothing.
//
// Unset means rebuild. That direction is not an accident either: a lane that
// forgets to declare its clone runs slower, while one that wrongly claims a
// shared database corrupts every package after it.

// reusableClone reports whether owner's database may be taken as already

//
// It returns a REASON alongside the verdict, and the caller prints it — but
// only for the refusals that say something is WRONG WITH THE TEMPLATE. The
// asymmetry matches scripts/lib-testdb.sh migrate_template, and the cut is
// between two different kinds of "no":
//
//   - This database is not the lane's clone (no variable, or a name that does
//     not match). That is a fact about the CALLER, not about any schema: the
//     serial lane and tools/extmigrategate both arrive here legitimately and
//     get exactly what they asked for. Silent.
//   - The lane's own clone is behind, diverged, unverifiable or already
//     populated. Somebody has to fix a template, and until they do the lane
//     pays the rebuild it was meant to stop paying. Reported.
//
// So a line in a lane log means a template to fix, and a lane that prints none
// is one where every package took the skip — which is what makes "no rebuild
// lines" a usable structural check on the whole run rather than a count of
// exceptions.
//
// An error is reserved for a database that could not be asked. Everything the
// probe can actually establish about the schema resolves to reuse-or-rebuild,
// because rebuilding is always correct.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES, exactly, because the difference is the whole risk. It proves
// that the LEDGER records this binary's own migrations, by content, and that the
// tables a reset acts on hold no rows. It does NOT compare the live catalog
// against what those migrations build — a column somebody added to the template
// by hand is invisible here. That comparison cannot be made cheaply, and not for
// want of trying: the only way to know what a migration set builds is to build
// it, which is the rebuild being skipped. backend/migrations' own head-schema
// digest has the same shape and the same limit.
//
// What bounds it is the clone, not the probe. A reusable database is a file copy
// of margince_test taken for ONE package and dropped after it, and the lane
// rebuilds that template from scratch on every full run (scripts/lib-testdb.sh
// build_template); `make test-db-up` is the same thing by hand. So the window in
// which hand-made DDL can survive is the window in which somebody edits the

// checks below already refuse every way the migration SET can differ, which is
