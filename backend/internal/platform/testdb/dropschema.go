// dropTableBatch is how many tables one DROP TABLE statement names. It bounds
// the statement's HEAVYWEIGHT LOCK COUNT, which is the whole point — see
// dropPublicSchema.
//
// 8 is measured, not guessed. A batch's cost is not its table count: CASCADE
// also locks each dropped table's indexes and every constraint riding on it, so
// on this schema a batch runs ~30-40 locks per table. Batches of 24 peaked at
// 780; batches of 8 peak at 339, which puts the drop at or below what one
// ordinary Reset already costs — the point past which shrinking it further only
// buys round trips.
const dropTableBatch = 8

// unreferencedTables lists tables no OTHER table's foreign key points at — the
// leaves of the reference graph, at this instant. Dropping those first is what
// keeps a batch's lock count near the batch size: CASCADE on a table that IS
// referenced must also lock every referencing table to drop the constraint, so
// naming `workspace` early drags most of the schema into that one transaction
// no matter how small the batch is. Emptied leaf by leaf, the heavily
// referenced tables become leaves themselves before their turn comes.
//
// A self-reference (conrelid = confrelid) does not disqualify a table: dropping
// it takes that constraint with it and locks nothing else.

// anyTables is the fallback for a reference CYCLE, where every remaining table
// is pointed at by another and unreferencedTables is empty. Naming a batch of
// them with CASCADE breaks the cycle and guarantees the loop makes progress —
// at a higher lock count for that one statement, which is the honest price of a
// shape the leaf order cannot resolve.
//
// This schema DOES reach it, on the last handful of tables: contact ↔ lead and
// passport ↔ oauth_grant are mutual references, so the loop ends with one
// fallback round of nine tables (353 locks, measured). The branch is live, not
// defensive — do not "simplify" it away on the assumption the leaf order always

// dropPublicSchema empties and recreates public — the same end state the single
// `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` this replaced produced, reached in bounded steps
// so that no ONE transaction holds a lock on the entire schema at once.
//
// WHY, precisely, because the one-liner reads better and was correct:
// PostgreSQL's lock table is CLUSTER-WIDE and fixed at startup —
// max_locks_per_transaction × (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)
// slots, shared by every backend on the instance, not a per-transaction budget.
// `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` takes an AccessExclusiveLock on every relation,
// index, constraint, view, sequence, function and type in the schema and holds
// all of them to commit: measured on this schema at 4999 locks against the
// stack's 6400 slots (docker-compose.dev.yml, 64 × 100). One is 78% of the
// instance. TWO CONCURRENT ONES CANNOT BOTH FIT, and the loser does not wait —
// the lock table is not a queue, so it fails outright with
//
//	ERROR: out of shared memory (SQLSTATE 53200)
//	HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.
//
// The integration lane runs INTEGRATION_JOBS packages at once (16 in CI), each
// its own process against its own clone database on the SHARED instance, and
// each calls EnsureSchema as its first act — so the collision is not exotic, it
// is what the lane does on every run. It surfaced as three unrelated suites
// failing in one shard on "migrating the test schema" / "resetting schema",
// which names the victim rather than the cause; the cause is whichever two
// backends happened to overlap here.
//
// The drop is therefore taken apart into steps that are each their own
// statement, and so each their own transaction, releasing before the next
// begins: tables leaves-first in batches of dropTableBatch, then each extension
// on its own, then the near-empty schema. Measured peak locks in any ONE
// transaction, on this schema:
//
//	one DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE           4999   (78% of the instance)
//	batched by oid, 24 at a time             1951
//	batched leaves-first, 24 at a time       1086
//	batched leaves-first, 8 at a time         653   ← here
//
// Two orderings earn their keep. Leaves first (unreferencedTables): CASCADE on a
// referenced table must lock every referencing table too, so naming `workspace`
// early drags most of the schema into one transaction whatever the batch size.
// Extensions individually: with the tables gone, `DROP SCHEMA CASCADE` was still
// 1086 locks, essentially all of it btree_gist and vector taking their operators,
// opclasses and support functions with them — split out, the worst is 653 and the
// final schema drop is 18.
//
// 653 is no longer an outlier: it is what one ordinary Reset already costs on
// this schema, so EnsureSchema stops being the statement that alone cannot share
// the instance. Sizing the instance for the lane's remaining steady-state demand
// is a separate matter, and is done where the instance is defined —
// docker-compose.dev.yml, which CI runs via `make db-up`.
//
// The split is the fix and the ceiling is the headroom, in that order and not the
// other way round: the arithmetic depends on the schema's size and the lane's
// concurrency, both of which grow, so a ceiling raised to fit today's numbers is
// re-crossed by the next twenty tables. Not holding the whole schema in one
// transaction does not expire.
