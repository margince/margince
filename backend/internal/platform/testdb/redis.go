// Two other places carry it and they are NOT all the same number. REDIS_DBS in
// scripts/test-integration-parallel.sh is this same highest index; --databases in
// docker-compose.dev.yml is a TOTAL and so is one greater, since Redis
// counts the reserved db 0. Raising the three to one value would take the lane's
// top db away without saying so, which is why
// TestRedisDBCountAgreesWithTheLaneAndTheServer asserts the offset rather than
// equality — and asks the running server too, since a container started before a
// raise keeps serving the old count whatever the file says.

// tests, so this is an isolation boundary, not a preference: db 0 is excluded
// because a running `make dev` owns it, and a value the lane never assigns is
// refused rather than quietly redirected — a fixture that flushed the wrong db
// would take out a package that has no idea it exists.
