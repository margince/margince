// mark written before the effect would, on a crash in between, survive as
// a claim with no effect — the redelivery would be swallowed and the
// event silently dropped. Marking after means a crash can only cause a
// re-run, which the authoritative idempotency layer (effects upsert by
// natural key — uq_activity_source and kin) absorbs as a no-op. This
// wrapper is therefore an optimization over that layer, never a
// correctness substitute for it.
