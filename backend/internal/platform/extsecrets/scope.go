// A row lock cannot do this job. FOR UPDATE locks a row that exists; on a
// first store there is none, so two concurrent first-stores would each read
// nothing, each seal their own material, and each insert. One wins, the
// loser's ON CONFLICT overwrites vault_ref — and the winner's blob is
// orphaned with nothing left naming it, because the loser saw no previous
// ref to supersede. Narrow and inert, but it is a leak of exactly the kind
// this store exists to prevent, so it is closed rather than documented.
//
// An advisory lock covers the absent row because it is keyed on the NAME,
// not on a tuple. (Two keys, for now: the second is the workspace-qualified
// one the previous release took, held through the rolling-deploy window
// storekit.LockWriteIdentity explains.) Under READ COMMITTED the loser takes a fresh snapshot for
// its next statement, so once it acquires the lock its own lookup sees the
// winner's committed row and supersedes it correctly. Same idiom, same
// reason, as the boot inventory's check-and-insert guard
// (compose/extensioninventory.go).
//
// It is taken on the write path only. A concurrent remove destroys the ref
// it removes, so no interleaving with it can strand a blob: either this
// lookup runs first and the delete then waits on the row lock, or the row is
// already gone and this becomes a first store.

// Collisions serialize two unrelated keys for the length of a transaction,
