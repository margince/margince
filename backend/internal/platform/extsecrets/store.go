// Package extsecrets is the extension tier's secret namespace: the one
// implementation of the published extension.Secrets port (ADR-0069).
//
// It sits between two things that each own half the problem and neither of
// which can own the other's. platform/keyvault is the custodian of secret
// MATERIAL: it seals bytes, hands back an opaque workspace-scoped Ref, and
// has no key/value namespace, no user scope, and no notion of an extension.
// An extension, on the other hand, addresses secrets by its own bare key
// names ("signing", "token") and must never see a Ref — a Ref is a
// capability, and one that reached extension code could be persisted
// somewhere the core cannot revoke. extension_secret is the mapping between
// the two, and this package is its only writer.
//
// The namespace wall is structural rather than checked: For closes over the
// invoking unit's name and every statement carries it, so there is no method
// on the port through which a unit could name another unit — reaching a
// sibling's namespace is not something the surface can express.
