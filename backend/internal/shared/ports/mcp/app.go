// The App half of the surface: a tool may name an interactive view, and the
// view declares what it is allowed to reach.
//
// This is the MCP Apps extension (SEP-1865, extension revision 2026-01-26),
// which is NOT part of the core protocol revision the transport negotiates —
// a host opts into it per request, and a host that does not is served a
// surface with none of this on it.
//
// WHY THE TWO HALVES LIVE IN ONE FILE. The tool names a view; the view states
// its own limits. Neither is readable without the other, and the one mistake
// that matters spans both: a tool that names a view nobody serves, or a view
// whose limits are wider than the one thing it renders. Keeping them apart
// would put the two ends of every such defect in two files.
//
// WHY THE VIEW DECLARES ITS LIMITS AND NOT THE TOOL. A view is a document with
// an origin, a script and a network reach; a tool is a call. The host builds
// its sandbox from the document's declaration before any call is made — it can
// prefetch and security-review a view without invoking anything — so the
// declaration has to travel with the document.

// ToolUI is what a tool says about the view that renders its result. Nil on
// every tool that has none, which is most of them: a tool without a view is
// the ordinary case and answers text as it always did.
type ToolUI struct {
	// ResourceURI names the view, and MUST be a URI the server's own resource
	// provider publishes. The protocol makes that the server's obligation
	// rather than the host's, because a host is entitled to prefetch the view
	// before the tool is ever called — so a URI nobody serves is not a broken
	// render, it is a host fetching a 404 and an App that silently never
	// appears.
	//
	// WHERE THAT IS ENFORCED is not registration, which sees one spec and no
	// provider: it is a sweep over the COMPOSED surface, where the registry and
	// the wired providers are both known. Registration refuses only what one
	// spec can be judged on — an empty URI, one outside the scheme, an
	// unrecognised audience.

	// Visibility is who may reach this tool: "model", "app", or both. A tool
	// the model cannot see is one a host MUST leave out of the agent's
	// catalog, which makes ["app"] alone a capability that exists only inside
	// a rendered view — and a surface with one of those has a capability no
	// unrendered client can reach.
	//
	// Empty means both, which is the honest default for a surface whose tools
	// were all model-callable before they had views.

// the sandbox's content-security policy from these lists and MUST NOT admit
// an origin they do not name, so a view that declares nothing can reach
// nothing — no fetch, no remote script, no external image. That is the
// posture a self-contained view wants, and it is the reason a view here
// declares its lists explicitly rather than inheriting a default: an
// allowlist that grows has to grow in a diff, next to the reason.
