// The party a captured record was WITH — one end of the exchange, and the one
// direction is defined against. Split from connector.go so the record shape and
// the party identity stay separately legible; MessageParticipant, the FURTHER
// parties, lives in participant.go beside it.

// Counterparty names the non-owner participant of one captured message. A
// mail record identifies them by Email (authoritative); a channel record
// identifies them by ChannelIdentity. A record carrying BOTH is named by the
// channel identity and CORROBORATED by the address: the identity outranks it,
// being the key a reply is routed on and the one a contact is bound by, while
// the address is evidence the resolution ladder may match against. Which is
// which is settled once, by capture's counterpartyShapeOf. DisplayName is the
// header's human name (may be empty or hostile — untrusted text); Domain is
// the lowercased mail domain, and stays empty on a channel record even when one
// corroborates, because every gate that reads it is a mail gate the channel
// shape short-circuits past; Direction is relative to the mailbox/bot owner
// (DirectionInbound | DirectionOutbound).

	// The four mail-domain gates (T0 internal-domain, freemail,

	// whoever sets it can whitelist an arbitrary address past transactional
	// suppression. Unexported, the compiler refuses every route a convention
	// could not — a positional literal, a JSON unmarshal, reflection, a

	// address treated as identity evidence.

//
// The conjunction lives here, in the port that owns the field, because neither
// half is sufficient and no caller may choose to apply only one. Direction
// compares the forgeable From header against the owner's address, so a spoofed
// From:owner delivered to the inbox would otherwise pass as the owner's own
