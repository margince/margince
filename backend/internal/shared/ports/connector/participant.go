//
// They sit beside NormalizedRecord rather than inside connector.go because the
// two ends of an exchange and everyone else are different kinds of fact.
// Direction is defined against the two ends, and a connector reports those
// through Counterparty and its own connection; the parties here are present
// without being either end.

// MessageParticipant is one further party to a captured message.
//
// Email is the raw header address; capture lowercases it, because that is how
// person_email stores one and a case difference would otherwise read as a
// different human. Role is one of the ParticipantRole constants below and is
// closed at the database, so an unknown value is refused rather than stored.
