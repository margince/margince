//
// Apart from the capture side because the two are optional in different ways —
// a capture-only provider implements none of this, and the frozen Connector
// interface names none of it — and because the message shape below is the one
// place the wire format of an outbound mail is described.

// EmailSender is the OPTIONAL outbound seam a connector implements when its
// provider can transmit a message as the connected user. Type-asserted like
// Watcher and Backfiller, so the frozen Connector interface is unchanged and a
// capture-only provider simply does not implement it.
//
// SendEmail MUST be idempotent on msg.MessageID. Job delivery is at-least-once,
// so a provider that retransmits on a retry mails the recipient twice; a
// connector whose provider can look up a prior send by RFC822 Message-ID must
// do so whenever msg.Attempt > 0 and return the existing receipt instead.
//
// That obligation has a precondition, and an implementation MUST refuse a
// message that fails it (EmailMessage.Validate) before any provider I/O: an
// identity the prior-send lookup cannot search for makes the idempotency
// guarantee unkeepable, and transmitting anyway is the double-send this seam
// exists to prevent.

// AttachmentCarrier is how a sending connector declares whether it can transmit
// files (ADR-0086/A131).
//
// THERE IS NO DEFAULT, and that is the whole design. The obvious way to add
// attachments — put a files field on the message, teach the mail adapter
// multipart, let the others ignore it — compiles everywhere and silently
// transmits the covering text without the file. The sender sees a timeline entry
// with an attachment chip, because the timeline records what was STAGED; the
// recipient sees a message referring to a file that is not there; nobody is
// told. That failure is silent, invisible at the call site, and permanent,
// because the record of what was sent is now wrong.
//
// So a sender that does not implement this seam is treated as carrying nothing,
// and a staged message with files PARKS rather than going out stripped. An
// adapter that gains the ability declares it here; one that never had it needs
// no change and cannot be mistaken for capable.
