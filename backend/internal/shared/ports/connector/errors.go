// The shared sync-failure vocabulary (ADR-0063). Providers wrap their own
// package errors with these so the registry can schedule without knowing any
// provider: auth parks the connection until its human reconnects, a rate
// limit honors Retry-After, everything else backs off — and no class ever
// tombstones a connection.

// ErrAuthRejected marks a credential the provider refused: expired, revoked,
// or insufficient. The connection needs its human, not a retry.

// off and retrying.

// ErrSendOutcomeUnknown marks a transmission whose OUTCOME the provider never
// reported: the request went out and no usable answer came back — a timeout, a
// reset connection, a response that could not be read. The message may be on
// its way and may not, and nothing on hand can tell.
//
// Separate from ErrUnreachable because retrying is only safe where a retry can
// DISCOVER that an earlier attempt transmitted. Mail can: the staged RFC822
// identity is searchable at the provider. Telegram's sendMessage offers neither
// an idempotency key nor a prior-send lookup, so a retry would message a
// customer twice with nothing able to detect it.
//
// A caller therefore NEVER retries this class — the delivery stops with the
// uncertainty on the record. Only a seam that cannot detect a prior send may
// report it.

// permanently: on a messaging channel, a customer who blocked the sender or an
// account that no longer exists. The provider gave a DEFINITE answer, so nothing
// was transmitted and the message may be re-addressed elsewhere — but no retry
// and no reconnection changes the verdict.
//
// Separate from ErrAuthRejected because the two send an operator after opposite
// problems: a credential fault is repaired by reconnecting, a blocked recipient
// is not repaired at all, and telling an operator to rotate a working credential
// wastes the one action they were given.
