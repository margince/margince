// Package jurisdiction is the Tier-0 seam behind country packs
// (architecture/14, ADR-0042): country-specific behavior lives in a
// self-contained pack composed in at compile time — today a module
// registering in init(), migrating to the extension tier's Registry
// (ADR-0069). Core code never imports a pack and never contains a
// jurisdiction string. The pack CONTRACT (Pack, Retention,
// RetentionClass) lives on the published surface
// backend/pkg/extension/jurisdiction so extensions can implement it;
// this package keeps the core-internal registry and re-exports the
// types as aliases so core call sites stay put.
//
// Deliberately absent: locale/i18n. Locale is per-user and orthogonal to
// jurisdiction (A57) — there is no LocaleBundle on this seam.
