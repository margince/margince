// Which field had the wrong shape, and what shape it wanted.

// encoding/json answers neither question for the request types this seam
// decodes into. oapi-codegen generates an UnmarshalJSON for every contract type
// carrying additionalProperties — every record body that takes custom fields —
// and it decodes field-by-field through a fresh json.Unmarshal per
// json.RawMessage. A fresh Unmarshal has an empty error context, so
// json.UnmarshalTypeError.Field is always "" and the path survives only in that
// wrapper's own prose. A transport reading the empty Field as "the whole body
// was the wrong shape" then tells a caller their object is a string, which is
// both false and unactionable.
//
// So the path is recovered by DECODING, not by matching the wrapper's sentence.
// A library's prose is a message nobody promised to keep; re-running the decode
// one key at a time asks the same decoder the same question and believes only
// its verdict.

// but a reader building on "the same one" would be building on a guarantee this
// does not give. It does guarantee the same answer every time for the same
// payload, which is what a caller fixing one field needs.
//
// It also assumes a field's value decodes independently of its siblings, which is
// what makes a per-field probe mean anything. True of every generated
// UnmarshalJSON in this contract — they are all the additionalProperties
// field-by-field shape — and it would stop being true of a discriminated union,
