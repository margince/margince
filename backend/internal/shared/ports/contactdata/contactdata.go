// Package contactdata is the seam licensed contact-data providers plug into
// (ADR-0096 Decision 4).
//
// MARGINCE NEVER SCRAPES A CONTACT. There is no GDPR-defensible way for this
// product to crawl the public web about a natural contact on its own authority,
// so first-party scraping of contacts is out permanently — and the crawl
// machinery that reads COMPANY sites deliberately does not extend here. What a
// provider brings that we cannot is its own lawful basis and its own contracts;
// that is the whole reason this is a port and not an implementation.
//
// The surface ships with NO provider registered, and that is a named state
// rather than a defect: the drawer renders "no data provider yet connected",
// the run endpoint answers the same, and nothing pretends to be searching.
// Connecting a provider later is a provider implementation, not a change to
// any of the guarantees below.
//
// Four guarantees bind every provider's consumers, unchanged by which provider
// is plugged in:
//
//	Every claim carries citations. A claim whose source cannot be opened is
//	dropped, never shown — the reader must be able to check it.
//
//	Nothing is written before an explicit human save. A run STAGES; the
//	record changes only when somebody reviews and accepts.
//
//	Correct and dismiss are available on every claim, and a human's verdict
//	is final against the provider.
//
//	Art. 50 disclosure rides the surface: the reader is told this is
//	AI-assisted and reads from public sources.
