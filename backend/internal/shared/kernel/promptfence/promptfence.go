// Package promptfence marks where untrusted data starts and stops inside a
// model prompt, with a boundary the writer of that data cannot spell.
//
// Every prompt that shows a model captured text wraps it in markers and tells
// the model that what sits between them is DATA, never instructions. That
// promise is only as good as the marker, and a fixed marker is built out of
// text the sender writes: a body containing the closing marker ends the span
// early, and everything after it reads as the prompt's own voice. Sending an
// email is enough to try it, and the payoff is direct — escape the fence in a
// counterparty verdict, answer "real" with confidence 1.0, and a spam address
// writes itself into the CRM.
//
// Recognising a forged marker is a losing game: the attacker picks from the
// whole of Unicode, and two of the attacks need no exotic characters at all —
// an invisible rune INSIDE the word, and a marker spliced across two fields
// fenced separately. So the marker is not matched, it is made unguessable. Each
// call mints a fresh one, names it in that call's own system prompt, and passes
// the data through byte for byte: a sender who has never seen the nonce cannot
// close a span bounded by it, in any script, from any number of fields.
//
// Passing the data through unedited is the point, not an efficiency. The
// evidence gates quote captured text back verbatim, so a pricing page reading
// "<10 users" must reach the model, and the stored evidence, as it was written.

// A fence's SCOPE is whatever body of text it bounds, and the rule is that the
// text it bounds must all have been written before the marker could have
// leaked. For a single stateless call — a verdict, an extraction, a classify —
// that means one fence per call, and reusing one across calls would be a defect:
// the nonce a previous sender saw quoted back to them is a nonce they can spell.
//
// A multi-step agent run is the sanctioned exception, because its transcript is
// cumulative: an observation written at step 2 is still in the prompt at step 9,
// so ONE fence spans the run (see modules/agents/runner). That buys a real
// residual — the model is shown the marker and can put it in a tool argument, so
// a run whose tools reach an outsider can leak its own boundary, and text
// arriving after that leak is bounded by a marker its author may have seen. It
// is bounded by the run, never wider, and the alternative (a fresh marker per
// call over text written under the old one) declares a boundary the stored text
// does not have, which is strictly worse.
//
// The zero Fence is not usable: every marker-EMITTING method panics on it rather
// than write a guessable boundary (see [Fence.name]). [Fence.Minted] and the

// text it bounds must have been written before the marker could leak. A model
// that was shown the marker in the prompt that produced this very output has had

//
// Editing the data is the thing this package otherwise refuses to do, and the

// that was shown the marker one turn earlier, as the boundary it was told about
// — and markerPattern already treats [0-9a-fA-F-] as marker-shaped. So removal
