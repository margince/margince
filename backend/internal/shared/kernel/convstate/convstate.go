// Package convstate answers where a correspondence stands, on one axis, at a
// stated moment.
//
// A drafter is handed message timestamps and nothing else, which is not enough
// to write a truthful sentence about time: two days and eight months look the
// same to a model reading two dates, and the difference decides whether "as
// discussed" is a courtesy or a fabrication. This package turns the raw
// timestamps into the one fact a draft actually needs — how long the silence
// has run, and therefore what may be assumed about shared memory.
//
// It lives in the shared tier because the surfaces that need it sit in
// different places: the timeline module renders a floor draft with no model
// available, the signals module renders a warm-intro draft, and the
// composition layer runs the model drafters. A module may not import a
// sibling, so shared is the only tier all three can reach.
//
// The bands are pinned by DRAFT-AC-E-3 and DRAFT-AC-E-4: at BandNone a draft
// may imply no earlier contact, and at BandWeeks or BandMonths it may not
// assume the other party remembers an earlier exchange.
