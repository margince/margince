// Package relstrength is the relationship-strength arithmetic
// (formulas-and-rules §4): one deterministic recency × frequency ×
// reciprocity fold over counted interactions, never predictive ML.
//
// It is a leaf because the same arithmetic now answers two different
// questions. PO-F-3 asks how warm a contact is to the WORKSPACE, folding
// every activity linked to them. PO-F-3b asks how warm they are to ONE
// COLLEAGUE, folding only the interactions that colleague was actually in
// (ADR-0078). Same half-life, same saturation point, same reciprocity floor,
// and the same counting unit — two scores a user will see side by side on the
// same screen, so a constant tuned in one copy and not the other is a visible
// contradiction, not a rounding difference. The unit is on that list because
// the two gather from different tables — the workspace score from
// activity_link, the colleague score from activity_participant — and one unit
// across both is what keeps a chat-only relationship from reading as warm on
// the one and as never having spoken on the other.
// Held by: TestEveryInteractionCountReadsTheSharedUnit
// (backend/gates/interactionunit_test.go).
//
// The package holds no query and no storage. Callers gather counts however
// their question requires and hand them here; that separation is what lets
// the fold be tested against hand-computed values with no database at all.
