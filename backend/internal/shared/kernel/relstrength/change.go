package relstrength

// What CHANGED about a relationship, as opposed to what it currently is.
//
// The score is a pure function recomputed on every read, and the interaction
// projection stores only the present state. So the system can say "warm, 73"
// and cannot say "it went warm on Tuesday" — nothing anywhere remembers
// yesterday's number. That missing sentence is what a contact view actually
// opens on: "replied after 41 quiet days" is a reason to act, and "warm" is a
// description.
//
// Nothing is stored to fix that. Every change below is recovered from data the
// system keeps permanently — the contact's own interactions — by folding the
// SAME §4 curve over a window that ends in the past. Two consequences worth
// stating, because both are why this is a computation and not a table:
// erasing a source activity makes the derived change disappear with it, and a
// threshold retuned here applies to history rather than only to what happens
// next.
//
// What it deliberately cannot do is answer "everyone who went cold this week"
// without walking every contact. That feed is ADR-0078's GRAPH-RISK-1 and has
// its own design; if it is built, this is worth revisiting with a real
// workload behind it.

// The thresholds a change clears before it is worth putting in front of
// somebody. They are product decisions and live beside the §4 tunables so
// every surface that reports a change agrees on what counts as one.
