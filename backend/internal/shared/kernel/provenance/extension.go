// Extension is the attribution a core write carries when an extension unit
// made it: which unit, which version of it, and through which of its verbs.
//
// It is a SECOND dimension beside the actor, never a replacement for one. A
// unit's core write runs on the authority of the human who triggered it
// (a unit may never exceed its caller), so the audit row's actor stays that
// human and `ext:notes` in actor_id would break both the actor index's meaning
// and the on-behalf-of story. Who acted and what carried the action are
// different questions, and this answers the second.
//
// Every field is stamped by the CORE from the composed declaration and the
// invocation — never by the unit — which is what makes the answer worth
// trusting. A unit's own free-form content rides in the evidence entry's
// `detail` member instead.
type Extension struct {
	// Unit is the extension's name, as the composition declares it.

	// Version is the unit's declared version at the time of the write.

	// Via names the surface the call arrived on — `tool/file_note`,
	// `route/POST /ext/notes/file` — so an audit reader can tell an agent's
	// call from a contact's without a second lookup.
	Via string

	// Detail is the unit's OWN free-form context about ONE write, and the only
	// member of this entry a unit supplies. The three above are stamped per
	// INVOCATION; this one is bound per write by the ledger port, because it
	// describes a statement rather than a call.
	//
	// Raw JSON, because that is how it arrives from the published surface —
	// already checked for validity there — and decoding it into a map here
	// would only give this package a shape of its own to get wrong.

// namespace — and makes the promotion path to a column later a matter of
// backfilling from `evidence->'extension'->>'unit'`.
