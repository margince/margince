// Envelope is what every drafting surface is told about the correspondence it
// is writing into, as opposed to what it is writing about.
//
// The fields are pinned by ai-operational-spec.md §2.4 and they are all flat
// strings, which is a constraint rather than a style: the certification harness
// decodes a prompt payload as a string map to bound every field it carries, so
// a nested value here would refuse every draft case at preparation time. It is
// also the reason SilenceDays is a string — the field is rendered into a
// prompt, never arithmetic.
//
// Every field is server-derived. None of it comes from the counterparty's own
// text, which is what keeps an instruction in an inbound message from changing
// who a draft says it is from.

	// registers read as a machine that does not know who it is writing to.
