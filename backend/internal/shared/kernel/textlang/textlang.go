// Package textlang guesses what language a piece of correspondence is written
// in, and says so honestly when it cannot tell.
//
// A draft has to be written in the language of the correspondence rather than
// the language of the interface asking for it (DRAFT-AC-E-1): a German thread
// gets a German reply even when the rep's UI is English. Nothing in the
// product knew that, so drafts came out in English on German threads.
//
// The detector is deliberately small and stdlib-only, because it runs in the
// shared tier where the timeline and signals modules can reach it, and because
// the alternative — a model call to find out which language to write in — pays
// for a whole inference to answer a question stopwords answer.
//
// It is biased toward Unknown. This market code-switches constantly: German
// professionals write English mail to German colleagues, quote English threads
// in German replies, and sign off in either. Guessing German on an English
// thread produces a draft the rep cannot send, which is worse than the bug it
// replaces; answering Unknown lets the caller fall back down its own ladder to
// evidence it trusts more. So the winner needs both an absolute floor of hits
// and a clear margin over the runner-up, and gets neither from one greeting.
