// This is one question with one answer, and it had been answered in two places
// with different lists: the language detector knew about "From:" and "Von:",
// the draft's snippet knew about six headers, and neither knew what the other
// knew. Four separate defects came out of that seam, all with the same shape —
// a German thread drafting in English because the words never reached the
// detector.
//
// So the vocabulary lives here, once, beside the detector that needs it most.

// The opening rather than the whole message. An email states why it was sent in
// its first lines and spends the rest on detail, and the detail is what a reply

//
// An empty result is honest: a mail that is only headers, or only a quoted
// thread, carries no words for a draft to be grounded in, and returning the
// addresses instead would put them in the prompt.
//
// The quoted-only case needs its own answer here, and the reason is worth
// stating. NewTextOnly keeps a message that is ENTIRELY a quote, because its
// caller asks what language this text is in and the quote is then the only
// evidence there is. Grounding asks the opposite question — what did our
// correspondent write that a draft may stand on — and the honest answer for a
// message that added nothing of its own is nothing.
//
// That case is not only the ">"-prefixed one. A forwarded mail announces itself
// with "-----Original Message-----" and then carries plain unprefixed headers
// and prose: nobody on this thread wrote a word of it, and letting it through
// would ground a draft in a third party's text and put their address in the
// prompt. So the cut is made at the first quote marker wherever it falls,
// including the very first line.
