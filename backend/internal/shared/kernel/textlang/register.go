// Whether a German correspondence is on du or Sie terms.
//
// This is the same shape of problem as the language, and it was left to the
// prompt for one release longer. The rule said "address the recipient as Sie
// unless the correspondence shows both sides already using du", which is
// correct and unusable: the model re-decides it on every call, and on a real
// thread carrying four du-forms and four Sie-forms it answers differently each
// time. Two consecutive drafts to the same contact, one du and one Sie, is worse
// than either — it reads as a machine that does not know who it is writing to.
//
// So the register is resolved once, from the correspondence, and travels in the
// envelope beside the language. The model is told which one to use rather than
// asked to work it out.
