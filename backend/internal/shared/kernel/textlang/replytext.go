// lands in the lead window: a long English confidentiality notice under a short
// German reply can outvote the reply itself.

// ONE cut, at the earliest boundary — not one cut per detector. Cutting
// sequentially looks equivalent and is not, in both directions:
//
//   - The second cut measures the floor against text the first cut already
//     shortened. A short reply plus a long signature clears twelve words, so

//     its own signature, which is the defect this file exists to fix.

// first case, so reverting to sequential cuts does not immediately break the
// suite. That makes this the cheaper of two guards against the same defect, not
