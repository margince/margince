// A footer is not a quote. It carries none of the markers quoteStart looks for
// — no '>', no attribution line, no envelope header — so it stays inside the
// candidate reply, and a long English confidentiality notice under a two-line
// German reply puts dozens of English function words in the lead window at the
// same weight as the reply's own. Detect then answers English for a message a
// contact wrote in German, which is the defect the whole package exists to
// prevent (DRAFT-AC-E-1).
//
// Two boundaries, because two things are being cut and they announce themselves
// differently. The sig-dash is a convention and is trusted on sight. A legal
// footer has no convention, so it is recognized by the phrases such notices
// actually open with, in the languages this product has correspondence in.
// Whichever comes first wins. Trusting the sig-dash unconditionally hid an
// EARLIER footer whenever a company put its legal notice above the signature
// block: the footer's English stayed in the text and outvoted the reply, which
// is the case this function exists to prevent.

// footerLeads are the phrases a legal footer opens with. Matched at the start of

// mid-sentence ("the information you sent") are prose and must not cut.
//
// The list is short on purpose, and every entry is SPECIFIC enough that it can
// only open boilerplate. A generic opener is the trap: "the information
// contained in this" also opens "…proposal explains our position", so the
// entries name the noun ("in this e-mail") and a bare "disclaimer:" is left out
// entirely, because a contact writing about a disclaimer starts a line with it.
//
// The asymmetry is why. A false positive TRUNCATES somebody's real reply and
// then answers with the wrong language; a missing entry only leaves that
// footer's votes in the pool, where the lead window usually still carries the
// reply. Missing one is the cheaper mistake, so the list errs that way.
