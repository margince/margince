// How many minor units a currency has, and how to say an amount out loud.
//
// Money is stored as an integer count of minor units, which is the only shape
// that does not lose cents. Rendering it is where the arithmetic goes wrong,
// and it goes wrong in two opposite directions: raw, and the reader takes
// 18000000 to mean eighteen million; divided by 100, and every zero-decimal
// currency is understated a hundredfold. VND, JPY and KRW have no minor unit at
// all — ¥18,000,000 IS eighteen million yen, and `/100` turns it into 180,000.
//
// It lives HERE, beside Money, because both callers of the table are on
// different sides of a dependency edge: the offer-draft price check is in
// package compose, and the account brief is in compose/orgbrief, which compose
// imports — so orgbrief cannot import compose and the table cannot live there.
// This package is Tier-0 and importable from both.

// currencyMinorDigits lists the ISO-4217 codes whose minor unit is not the
// usual two digits — the zero-, three- and four-digit exceptions. Most
// currencies, including EUR and USD, carry two, so the table names the
// departures and the default below carries the rest.
//
// It is a list of the departures this build knows, NOT a claim to hold every
// one. ISO also assigns codes with no minor unit at all (the precious metals,
// XDR, the test code XTS), and the standard is amended. A code missing here
// renders at two digits and is wrong for that code — which is why the tolerable
// failure is the one MinorUnitDigits documents, and why adding a code is a
// one-line change rather than a redesign.
