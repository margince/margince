// The consumer groups: WHO reads the streams, as distinct from which types
// exist and where each one rides, which is the catalog's job.
//
// The two answer different questions and change for different reasons — a new
// event type touches the catalog, a new consuming module touches this file — so
// they are kept apart rather than growing one file that a reader has to scan
// past half of to reach either.

// module sees every event once and scales horizontally inside the group.

// the events.md §4.3 set plus the later consumers; the census test
// mirrors the full list. cg:workflows and cg:read-model subscribe to
// everything by design; cg:audit-stream also does, because its "all
// actor.type=agent events" slice cuts across every stream and Redis
// consumer groups can only partition by stream, not by envelope field —
// the actor filter is in-process, like the workspace filter.

		// rather than a second handler on cg:context-graph: a projection
		// rebuild must not be able to stall embedding freshness, and the two
		// have unrelated failure modes.
		{Name: "cg:graph-edge", Streams: forEntities(activityStreamEntity, personStreamEntity)},
		// The audience-change corrector: when a human LIMITS a message after
		// the derived models were built, the derived signals citing it narrow
		// and the thread's scan watermark drops so the next extraction pass
		// re-reads under the new audience. Its own group rather than a second
		// handler on cg:graph-edge for the same isolation reason: re-scoping
		// signals must not be able to stall the edge projection, and vice
		// versa.
		{Name: "cg:audience-rescope", Streams: forEntities(activityStreamEntity)},
		// The LinkedIn ghost matcher (ADR-0078 §8b). Its own group rather than
		// a second handler on cg:graph-edge: that consumer lives in the search
		// module and this call belongs to people, and a module never reaches
		// into a sibling. It listens on the person and organization streams —
		// a contact appearing is a chance to attach a ghost, and so is an
		// account appearing, because employer resolution is what most ghosts
		// are waiting on.
		{Name: "cg:linkedin-match", Streams: forEntities(personStreamEntity, organizationStreamEntity)},

		// Its own group rather than a second handler on cg:person-auto-enrich:
		// this repair attaches mail the workspace already holds to a record it
		// already has, and must keep flowing when an enrichment that calls out
		// to a model is slow or wedged.
		{Name: "cg:cohort-promote", Streams: forEntities(personStreamEntity)},
		// Turning a won deal into what its partner earned. Its own group
		// because accrual is money: a projection rebuild or an embedding
		// backlog must never be able to stall it, and a failure to accrue must
		// never look like a failure to index. It listens on the deal stream,
		// where deal.stage_changed carries both the win and the reopen that
		// reverses one.
		{Name: "cg:commissions", Streams: forEntities(dealStreamEntity)},
		// What happened in a Deal Room, written onto the deal's timeline. Its own
		// group because a room's traffic is live and conversational while the
		// projections above are batchy: a backlog of embeddings must not delay the
		// note that says the buyer just asked something. It listens on the deal
		// stream, where every deal_room event rides.
		{Name: "cg:deal-room-timeline", Streams: forEntities(dealStreamEntity)},
		// The AI-activity projection (ai_task_run): what the rail and the
		// activity feed read. Its own group because a projection backlog must
		// not be able to stall anything that spends money or moves a record,
		// and because it is the only group on the aitask stream — an
		// all-stream group would carry this traffic for nothing.
		{Name: "cg:ai-activity", Streams: forEntities(aiTaskStreamEntity)},
		// Filling a contact from what their employer's site already published
		// (ADR-0072 arc). Its own group for the same reason as the matcher
		// above: the deep read fills a published person DURING the crawl, so
		// a contact who arrives afterwards is never matched against what that
		// site said. It listens on the person stream alone — the fill is
		// keyed on the contact, and an account appearing enriches nobody
		// until a person is filed against it, which is itself a person event.
		{Name: "cg:person-auto-enrich", Streams: forEntities(personStreamEntity)},
		// The prompt half of captured-organization auto-enrich (ADR-0072
		// arc): an organization appearing or changing queues the workspace's
		// enrich pass NOW instead of leaving a company created between two
		// daily sweeps without a dossier for up to a day. Its own group
		// rather than a second handler on cg:linkedin-match for the standing
		// reason: that consumer belongs to search-adjacent matching, this one
		// to capture enrichment, and the two must not share a cursor. It
		// listens on the organization stream alone — the pass it queues
		// re-derives which organizations are due from the database, so no
		// other entity's event can make one due that this stream's events do
		// not already announce.
		{Name: "cg:org-auto-enrich", Streams: forEntities(organizationStreamEntity)},
		// Automatic enrichment from a LICENSED provider (ADR-0101/PI-EVT-1).
		// Its own group rather than a second handler on the pass above,
		// because the two differ in what a failure costs: that one reads a
		// page the workspace already crawled, this one SPENDS the customer's
		// credits, and a consumer whose retries buy data must not share a
		// cursor with one whose retries are free.
