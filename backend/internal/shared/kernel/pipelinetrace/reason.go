// Reason is WHY a stage reached the status it did — a class this installation
// chose, never a provider's text and never message content.
//
// That restriction is what makes the default posture sufficient. With payload
// capture off the trace stores no address and no subject, so if a skip could
// only be explained by quoting the message, every installation running the
// default would read "we cannot tell you" — which is the state this surface
// exists to remove. A class renders a full sentence from the catalog with no
// payload at all.
//
// SCOPED BY STAGE. The catalog key is `<stage>.<reason>`, so the same code says
// something stage-appropriate in each place it appears: ReasonTransportNotRead
// under the classifier is "reads email only", and under the conversation reader
// it is a different sentence about a different pass. Without the scope the two
// would need differently-spelled constants saying nearly the same thing, and the
// pair would drift.
