// Package pipelinetrace is the vocabulary of the ingress pipeline as a member
// reads it: which stages a captured message passes through, what each can
// honestly say about itself, and why a stage that says nothing says nothing.
//
// It is vocabulary and nothing else — no storage, no queries, no port. The
// stages are answered from two different places (a trace row capture already
// writes, or live product state a module already owns), and both the modules
// that answer and the compose layer that assembles them import this. That is
// why it sits in kernel rather than in either of them.
//
// WHAT THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. A stage could previously decline to run and
// leave nothing a member could read: the attention classifier reads
// `kind = 'email'`, so a message that arrived over a chat transport was never
// eligible, and no surface said so. The answer took a code read. A registry
// whose gates refuse an unexplained stage is the structural fix — a list is a
// thing to forget, and three stages had already been forgotten.
