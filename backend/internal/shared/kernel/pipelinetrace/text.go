// RetentionHours is how long a STORED rung is kept, reported on every answer so
// a reader can tell an expired rung from one that never happened.
//
// It mirrors capture's own TraceWindowHours rather than importing it — capture
// is a module and this is a Tier-0 leaf, so the dependency can only run the
// other way. TestTheRetentionHoursAgreeWithTheSweep in capture asserts the two
// are equal, because they are two literals guarding one member-facing claim:
// whether a rung says the record is gone or that it never happened.

//
// The client owns the real wording, in its own catalog, in three locales. These
// exist for one case the catalog cannot cover: a stage or reason added by a
// newer server than the client. Without them that rung would either vanish or
// render a raw identifier at a member — which is exactly how a missing key
// stayed invisible on this surface once already.
//
// So they are deliberately plain. A client that recognises the key never shows
// them, and an English sentence on a German screen is a worse outcome than a
// localised one but a far better outcome than `attention_label.transport_not_read`.
