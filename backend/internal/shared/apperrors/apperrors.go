// FieldFault is implemented by a typed error that refuses a SPECIFIC input:
// it names the contract field the caller must change, the contract's stable
// machine code for the refusal, and what to fix.
//
// It exists because the verdict belongs to the error, not to the transport
// that happens to be carrying it. Every module used to spell its own typed
// refusals out again in an HTTP-side mapper (`writeStoreErr` and friends), so
// a refusal was a 422 naming the field on REST and — on the MCP tool surface,
// which reaches the same stores through the datasource seam and never runs
// those mappers — an unclassified error reported as an internal server fault
// with advice to retry. Implementing this instead makes the refusal legible
// wherever it travels, including to a surface that did not exist when the
// error type was written.
//
// A module opts in by adding the method; httperr's choke point does the rest.
// The narrower typed errors in shared (values.ParseError, storekit's list
// vocabularies, datasource's seam refusals) keep their own dedicated branches,
// which take precedence over this one.
type FieldFault interface {
	error
	// FieldFault returns the offending field's contract path, the contract's
	// machine code for this refusal, and a message saying what to fix. All
	// three reach the caller, so none of them may carry internal detail.

// FieldFaults is FieldFault's plural: a refusal that names SEVERAL bad inputs
// at once, which a schema validator naturally produces. Collapsing such an
// error into one field would hide the rest, so it reports them all and the
// choke point renders every entry.
//
// A type implements one or the other, never both. The plural is checked first,
// because a type carrying a list has nothing useful to say as a single field.

// MessageFault is for a refusal that is legitimately the caller's business to
// know about but names NO input the caller can change: an authority or
// configuration state (no send-capable mailbox), or server-side data the
// workspace has not loaded (no FX rate for a currency pair).
//
// It exists because FieldFault was applied to those cases first, and pointing
// at a field is worse than pointing at nothing when the field is not an
// argument of the operation: an agent told to fix `from` on a send that has no
// `from` argument has been handed a task it cannot perform, and will either
// retry unchanged or invent a value. Naming the condition and saying a human
// must act on it is the honest answer.
//
// A type implements exactly one of the three fault forms.
