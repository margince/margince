// their walk scopes.
//
// A waiver carries two obligations: it states what it costs, and it describes
// code that still exists. Both are enforced here rather than per gate, so a
// gate cannot hold its exceptions to a weaker standard than its neighbours.
//
// gatekit is imported only from _test.go files. A waiver mechanism reachable
// from product code would be a way to mark shipped behaviour "ratified", which
// is not what a waiver is for; the census holds that line.

// rather than bytes: whitespace is normalised first so padding is not length,
// and a reason written in a script whose runes are several bytes wide states no

//
// Length is only half the floor. A reason that restates its own subject
// identifies the exception at any length without saying what it buys or gives
// up — which is the half a later reader needs in order to judge whether the
// trade still holds — so a restatement is refused however long the subject is.
