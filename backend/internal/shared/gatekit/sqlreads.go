// Finding the reads of one table, for the gates that judge them.
//
// Several census gates derive their SITES the same way — a pattern over the SQL
// string literals in the tree, attributed to the declaration holding them — and
// each then judges those sites by its own rule: a held row must be excluded, an
// edge read must be admitted, a served reference must be bounded. The rules
// differ; the walk does not, so the walk lives once.
//
// A census that stops recognising this tree's SQL finds nothing objectionable
// and reads exactly like a clean tree. Nothing fails. That is why the matching
// is here rather than in each gate: one place to be right, one place to test,
// and a gate cannot inherit a blind spot it did not write.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: the verdicts. Which markers satisfy, which
// waiver sets exist, whether a file or a declaration is the unit of judgement —
// those are each gate's own policy, and a shared "satisfied" would be one
// definition of correctness for several different obligations.

// TableReadPattern matches a SQL string literal that reads the named table.
//
// Two properties carry it, and a census silently under-reports without either:
//
//   - the match ends on whitespace, a NEWLINE, the end of the text, or a
//     delimiter. Requiring a trailing space misses every statement whose line
//     ends at `FROM person`;
//   - the end-of-text alternate only fires against UNQUOTED text. A literal's
//     token still carries its closing delimiter, so a statement ENDING at the
//     table name is invisible unless the text has been unquoted — which is what
//     LiteralText is for, and what TableReads does.
//
// The table name is quoted into the pattern rather than interpolated raw: a
// caller naming a table with a regex metacharacter would otherwise silently
// widen or break its own census, and a census that matches the wrong thing
// reads exactly like a clean tree.
