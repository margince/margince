// A scheduling column is written by ONE clock: the database's.
//
// A due-scan compares its column against now() INSIDE Postgres, so every
// statement that writes the column has to take its value from that same now().
// A deadline bound from Go makes the comparison cross-clock, and two clocks are
// only ever coincidentally equal — an app process running AHEAD pushes work
// into the future and starves it, one running BEHIND shortens every delay and
// can defeat a backoff outright.
//
// The rule needs a gate rather than a paragraph because the defect is invisible
// at runtime on any machine whose two clocks agree, which is every CI runner and
// every developer laptop: no test that exercises the store can fail against it.
// It needs a SHARED gate because the tree has now reached for the same rationale
// in four places, and the two occasions it was written as a comment were both
// occasions where habit was the only thing keeping it true.
//
// The obligation belongs to whichever package owns the table (tableownership
// pins that), so each such package instantiates this on its own column: the
// write sites are derived from source, and only the column is named.
