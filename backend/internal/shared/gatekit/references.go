// References reports whether a parsed file reaches symbol in the package at
// importPath — as a call, or as a value it could call later.
//
// It is how a path-scoped gate names the site it judges without type-aware
// analysis of the whole module, and it exists once because every gate that
// wants it wants the same four things:
//
//   - NAMING is enough. A check that matched only `pkg.Sym(...)` is walked past
//     by `f := pkg.Sym; f(...)`, and following a function value needs the type
//     information a fitness test does not have. A file has no reason to hold a
//     symbol it never intends to use, so a gate that treats a reference as use
//     closes that route; a file that genuinely needs the symbol for something
//     else says so through a waiver, which is visible, rather than through a
//     spelling the gate cannot see.
//   - The QUALIFIER is the caller's choice. `import dm ".../dbmigrate"` and a
//     dot-import that leaves the symbol bare reach it exactly as much as the
//     canonical spelling does, so the name is resolved through the file's own
//     imports rather than assumed.
//   - A file INSIDE the package reaches the symbol with no import at all.
//   - PROSE IS NOT A REFERENCE. A gate's own doc comment and failure message
//     name the symbol it hunts, and a text scan over a tree that includes the
//     gate flags the gate. Comments and string literals carry no identifier for
//     the syntax tree to match, so this cannot.
//
// The in-package case keys on the package clause matching importPath's last
// element, which is this repo's convention for every package a gate targets. A
// package whose name differs from its directory would need its own spelling.
