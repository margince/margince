// A field the contract declares REQUIRED is answered, or the API is lying in a
// way no caller can detect.
//
// `workspace_id` was declared required and never mapped, so every approval this
// module has ever returned carried the zero uuid — a well-formed value in the
// right place that happens to name no workspace. Nothing failed: not the
// contract gate, which checks shape rather than content; not the handler tests,
// which assert the fields they were written to assert; and not any client,
// because a uuid of zeroes deserializes perfectly.
//
// So the obligation is derived from the contract type itself rather than kept
// as a list of fields somebody remembers to extend. A REQUIRED field in OpenAPI
// 3.1 generates as a NON-POINTER on the Go struct, and an optional one as a
// pointer — which makes "required" mechanically readable here, and makes a
// field the contract promotes to required tomorrow covered on the day the
// generator runs.
