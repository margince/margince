// StageUnlessDeclined's ordering, over a real Postgres — the one property that
// cannot be shown without two live transactions.
//
// The refusal itself is arithmetic: read the prior offers, skip if any is
// rejected. What needs proving is that the read happens LATE ENOUGH to see an
// offer a competing pass is still writing. `FOR UPDATE` cannot give that on its
// own: it locks the rows it finds, and it finds nothing when the competing pass
// has not committed yet — so the identity lock has to be taken first.
