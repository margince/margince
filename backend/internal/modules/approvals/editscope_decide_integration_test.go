// An approval a human edits may be corrected, never re-aimed — proved through
// Decide rather than by calling assertSameCallIdentity directly, because the
// assertion is only worth anything if the decide path actually calls it. The
// decide path is also where the row, the diff hash and the audit evidence are
// all rewritten together in one transaction, which the unit suite cannot show.

// writes (this package cannot import compose to call it directly: compose sits
// above modules in the dependency graph, so the literal below is hand-built
// rather than bound to the producer) — against one organization, then asks
// Decide to release an edit whose PATH names a different organization while
// its body is untouched. The content stayed identical — only the record
