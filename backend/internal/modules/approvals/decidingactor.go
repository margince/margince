// Who is behind a decision, and what their credential may spend on it.
//
// authority.go answers whether an approval is decidable AT ALL by the grants
// and row scope its release needs — the same question for a person in their own
// seat and for an agent acting on their behalf. This file answers the other one,
// which only exists because a decision can now arrive on a lent credential: is
// there a person behind this call, and did they lend it enough to release THIS.
//
// The split is the difference between authority and admission. A passport
// carries its human's grants, so nothing in authority.go needs to know it is a
// passport; what it cannot see is that a credential is a bounded loan, and a
// bound the lender set is not one the borrower may lift.

// answering in a browser tab (ADR-0055), and the decision happens when they give

// So what is refused here is a call with NO human behind it: the system

// which is a credential nobody lent, whatever else it holds.
