// Which probe each staged target type takes, and why that probe and no other.
// The classification is the whole authority decision for a target: too wide and
// the inbox discloses a record its owning store hides, too narrow and the staged
// row is stranded where no human can release or reject it. These cases are pure
// — they assert the classification and the mechanism that makes the rejected
// alternative wrong; what the chosen probe then answers over real rows is the
// compose integration lane's job.
