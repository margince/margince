// What POLLING a staged proposal needs, as distinct from what redeeming one
// needs.
//
// The MCP Tasks extension hands an agent a durable handle while a person
// decides, and polling that handle asks two questions this module had no
// read-only answer for: has anyone decided yet, and — once they have — what
// exactly did they release? Both are reads, and neither settles anything: the
// decision they report still has to be redeemed, single-use, through Redeem.
//
// EVERY METHOD HERE IS BOUND TO THE PASSPORT THAT STAGED THE PROPOSAL, which is
// this file's gate and the reason it needs no other. These are not a human's
// view of an inbox — that is inbox.go, scoped to what a person may decide —
// they are an agent's view of its OWN proposal, and an agent has exactly one:
// the one it staged. So the binding is the whole authorization question, and
// answering it in the SQL rather than above it means no caller can be added
// later that forgets to ask.
//
// A proposal staged by a different passport, or by a human, is reported ABSENT
// rather than forbidden — the existence-hiding answer the row-scope rule gives
// everywhere else, because "that approval exists but is not yours" is an oracle.

// and an erasure all write it into the column (the CHECK has always admitted
// it). A reader that handled only the derived case would miss the stored rows,
