package approvals

// One live authority object per identical agent call.
//
// A refused 🟡 agent call is not a proposal a worker re-derives; it is a
// QUESTION an agent asks and then asks again, because the answer it gets back —
// "a human has to decide this" — is indistinguishable from the answer it got the
// first time. A stager that mints a fresh approval per attempt therefore turns
// one act into an inbox full of identical questions, each of which a human has to
// answer separately and only one of which any retry can spend.
//
// So the engine answers the question the caller is actually asking — "what is
// the authority object for THIS call" — rather than "record a new one". Two rows
// can already be the same question, and both cases are handled here under ONE
// predicate: a PENDING one is joined, and an APPROVED, unspent one is handed back
// so the agent redeems the decision it already has instead of asking for a second
// one.

// stager, whose proposal is about a RECORD and belongs to no credential, and
// wrong for a call, which is an act one passport is authorized to perform.
// Joining across credentials would hand passport B the id staged by passport A:
// B cannot redeem it, since the redemption checks the binding, so it loops on a
// dead id — and a caller with NO passport CAN redeem it, because the redemption
// enforces that binding only against a caller presenting one. Volunteering
// somebody else's authority object is not something a deduplication may do.
//
// So the credential is in the predicate, IS NOT DISTINCT FROM: a passport is
// offered only its own approvals, a passport-less caller only passport-less ones.

// makes the id handed back one the caller can actually spend.
