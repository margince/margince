// The inbox summary is the sentence a human reads before deciding, and it
// is the ONE part of an approval that is prose. Everything else on the row
// is structured and rendered by the UI; the summary is a string some stager
// composed, and several stagers compose it partly out of record text — a
// contact's display name, a company's name — which arrives from
// inbound capture or from a create an agent itself performed.
//
// So it is treated as untrusted at the point it is persisted, not at each
// place it is rendered: a marker that hides the rest of the line, a
// bidirectional override that reverses what follows it, or a benign prefix
// long enough to push the real content out of view are all cheap ways to
// make a human approve one thing while reading another. Sanitizing here
// means no stager can skip it and no renderer has to remember.

// characters carry no meaning a summary needs, and a name that relies on one
// is a name whose rendering was the point.
