// What a proposal was read out of, so confirming it is a check rather than a
// vote of confidence.
//
// Evidence is per CLAIM, not per approval: a proposal that asserts three things
// carries three elements, each naming the record and — where that record's body
// is line-addressed — the exact lines behind that one claim. A reviewer can
// then disagree with one claim without having to re-read everything.
//
// It is deliberately generic. Transcript proposals are the first kind to
// populate it, but nothing here knows what a transcript is, so every other
// staging kind gains evidence by filling the same field.
