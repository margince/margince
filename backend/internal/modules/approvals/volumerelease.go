// Confirm-and-continue (api-rate-limits-and-abuse §2.4, BYO-STEP-1/-2): the one
// staged kind whose approval widens a volume window rather than releasing a
// write.
//
// It is here rather than behind the per-kind effect table because that table is
// deliberately closed to agent-minted stagings (serverProposed): a kind is not a
// namespace, and an agent choosing a kind that matched a registered executor
// used to be able to invoke it. This kind is never chosen by a caller — the tool
// surface mints it on a refusal, from the meter's own reading — and its subject
// is the passport the staging was stamped with, which no request body can
// influence. Saying that in a typed branch is honest; smuggling it past the
// provenance guard would not be.
