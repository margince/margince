// What a modify-then-approve edit may change, and what IS the approval.
//
// ADR-0036 §4 lets a human release a corrected version of a staged action. The
// correction is CONTENT — a name, an amount, a date, a body. It is not WHICH
// RECORD the action lands on: that is the approval's identity, and it is what
// the decide-time target-visibility probe (decidable → targetVisible) and the
// redemption-time version pin were both evaluated against, before the edit
// existed.
//
// The gap that makes this load-bearing: nearly every server-proposed effect
// resolves the record it writes from an entity id INSIDE the payload rather
// than from approval.target_entity_id, and several run under a system
// principal, which makes auth.Require return nil and empties every row-scope
// clause. (The exception proves the rule rather than weakening it: the
// assign_owner release reads the target from the immutable target columns via
// StagedTarget, which an edit cannot reach at all — it does not need this pin,
// and a kind that resolved its record that way would not.) So an edit
// that swaps an id turns an approval a human legitimately holds into a write
// against a record their own row scope hides — while the version pin still
// passes, because it re-reads the untouched original target. Pinning the
// references is what keeps "the action that was admitted" and "the action that
// runs" the same action.
//
// The pin applies to EVERY edit, including agent-staged ones whose redemption
// re-enters the admission gate and would therefore re-check a swapped id on its
// own. That is deliberate: serverProposed is a subtle discriminator to hang a
// security control on — getting it wrong once already produced a consumed
// approval for an effect that never ran — and no kind stages a payload whose
// entity ids a human is meant to correct. Content stays fully editable, which
// is what ADR-0036 §4 is for.
