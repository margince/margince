// One act's proposals, decided together. A bundle is a GROUPING over approval
// rows — `bundle_id`, no table, no entity, no lifecycle of its own (R7). It
// exists because one act routinely proposes several things at once (a site read
// stages the company's facts plus a lead per person it published) and the inbox
// otherwise shows them as unrelated questions.
//
// What it is NOT is a second authority object. ADR-0036 puts the authority in
// the staged row, and a bundle decision honours that: every member keeps its own
// diff hash, target version pin, expiry and verdict, and deciding the bundle
// records N per-effect decisions rather than one decision covering N effects.
// That is also why deciding is not all-or-nothing — the members were always
// independent, so one that expired or that someone else already decided reports
// for itself while its siblings decide normally.
