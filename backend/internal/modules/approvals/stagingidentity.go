// One proposal identity: whether the thing about to be staged is already on the
// table, and who owns that identity while it is decided.
//
// A stager fed by an at-least-once trigger — a connector sync re-hitting the same
// collision, a nightly sweep re-deriving the same diff — asks the same question
// every pass. Answering it is not a lookup but an ORDERING problem, which is why

// lockOrder is the ONE order in which any statement that row-locks more than
// one `approval` may take those locks.
//
// Two transactions that lock a shared set of rows in the same total order
// cannot deadlock; two that lock it in different orders eventually will, and
// PostgreSQL resolves that by aborting one of them with 40P01 — a 500 for
// whichever caller lost, on a decision or a re-proposal that was otherwise
// perfectly valid. That is not hypothetical here: a bundle decision locks every
// member of one bundle, and a re-proposal of the same act locks the rows it
// joins, so the two meet on the same rows routinely.
//
// (created_at, id) rather than created_at alone, because created_at is a
// timestamp two rows staged in one transaction share exactly. An order with
// ties is not a total order, and the ties are precisely the rows a single
// staging pass creates together — the ones most likely to be locked as a set.
//
// TestEveryMultiRowApprovalLockTakesTheCanonicalOrder holds every locking
// statement in this package to it.

// LockPendingGroupInTx takes, in the canonical order, every row lock an act
// that stages a GROUP of proposals against one target is going to need.
//
// A batch stager locks one row per member as it goes, in whatever order its
// payload happens to be in — the order a website lists its team page, say. The
// per-statement order is right for each statement and wrong for the
// transaction: nothing makes the sequence agree with the order a concurrent
// bundle decision walks the same rows in. Taking the whole set up front, here,
// is what makes those two agree, and every later statement in the act then
// finds rows this transaction already holds rather than acquiring a new lock in
// payload order.
//
// EVERY KIND THE ACT STAGES, in ONE statement, which is why kinds is variadic
// and not a second call. A site read stages the company's facts and the people
// its team page published, and re-proposing REBUNDLES what it joins — so a
// bundle holds members of both kinds with different ages, and a decision walks
// them in one interleaved (created_at, id) sequence. Locking one kind and then
// the other is two ordered runs, which is not one order: the decision can hold
// a lead this act wants while waiting for a facts row this act holds.
//
// The predicate is deliberately WIDER than any one member's — kinds and target
// alone — so it is a superset of what the joins, the rebundle and the
// supersession touch FOR THE KINDS IT NAMES. It says nothing about a kind the
// caller did not name, which is the whole reason the deepread act names both of
// its own. `now()` is transaction time, so the set locked here is the set those
// later statements resolve — with the one exception READ COMMITTED always
// leaves: a row another transaction commits afterwards is visible to them and
// not held by this. Serializing the stagers of one group is what would close
// that, at the cost of running them one at a time, and it is not closed here.
