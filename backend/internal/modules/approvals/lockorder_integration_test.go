package approvals

// The group pre-lock, against a real database.
//
// What it has to prove is a claim about a moment INSIDE a transaction — that by
// the time a batch stager touches its first member, it already holds the locks
// on all of them — and no unit test can see inside a transaction. The proof is
// a second connection: a row this transaction holds refuses NOWAIT, and a row
// it does not hold takes the lock immediately.
//
// It deliberately does NOT try to reproduce the deadlock. A deadlock needs two
// transactions to interleave at a specific instant, so a test that asserts one
// happens is flaky in one direction and a test that asserts one does not is
// flaky in the other. The mechanism is what makes the deadlock impossible, so
// the mechanism is what is asserted here; the ORDER the locks are taken in is
// held by TestEveryMultiRowApprovalLockTakesTheCanonicalOrder, over the SQL.
