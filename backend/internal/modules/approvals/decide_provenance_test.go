// The guard that keeps an agent-minted staging away from a server-side
// executor. The kind string alone cannot distinguish them — "enrich" names
// both a compose proposal flow and the tool behind three agent-reachable
// routes — so provenance does: a server-side proposal is staged by the system
// or by a human and carries no passport.
//
// The end-to-end path is exercised over a real database in
// compose/integration; this pins the predicate itself, which is where the
// distinction is actually made.
