package approvals

// A lock order is only a rule if every locker follows it.
//
// The deadlock this guards is not a race one reviewer can see in one file: it
// needs two statements, usually in two files, that lock a shared set of
// `approval` rows in different orders. Each reads correctly alone, which is why
// the obligation is derived from the package's own SQL rather than kept as a
// list somebody remembers to extend.
//
// THE SUBJECT IS ONE SQL EXPRESSION AT A TIME, resolved from the syntax tree.
// A first draft scanned the flattened file text for `FOR UPDATE` and walked
// backwards to a verb, and review demonstrated the hole: the span it matched
// began at an unrelated statement several functions earlier, whose
// `WHERE id = $1` then excused everything up to the next `FOR UPDATE` — so
// deleting the order from the very statement this gate exists to protect
// produced no finding at all. Folding each SQL expression separately is what
// makes each statement judged as itself.
//
// It also judges statements that carry NO lock clause. A multi-row UPDATE or
// DELETE takes row locks in scan order without saying so, which is exactly the
// defect the issue names — a gate that only looked for FOR UPDATE would read
// green over the shape it was written for.
