// ActiveColumns is this module's half of the fieldcatalog cross-module
// seam (shared/ports/fieldcatalog): the catalog READ a record store
// (people, deals, …) needs to drive its cf_* columns, exposed through a
// port those stores can depend on without importing this module
// directly (ADR-0054 §3). Compose wires the concrete *Service in; the
// stores themselves see only fieldcatalog.Reader.

// var _ fieldcatalog.Reader = (*Service)(nil) documents the seam at its
// provider — the compile-time assertion itself lives in the compose
// integration suite (customfields_fieldcatalog_integration_test.go),
// which is where a cross-module wiring defect would otherwise first
// surface.

// ActiveColumns answers the active custom-field columns for one object,
// ordered by column_name (a stable, deterministic order for SELECT/INSERT
// column-list building).
//
// Deliberately runs no auth.Require: this is called from inside a record
// store's Get/List/Create/Update, whose own RBAC gate already ran before
// the store reaches for its custom columns. What ActiveColumns exposes —
// which cf_* columns exist and their type — is schema (the same shape the
// admin catalog list already answers to anyone holding custom_field:read),
// not row data a second gate would need to narrow; the row-level RBAC the
// calling store enforces is what actually protects the values stored in
// those columns.

// Retirement is a status change and never a DROP COLUMN (lifecycle.go), so a
// retired field's column and values are still there to be filtered on. Excluding
// it here would turn every saved segment naming it into a 422 at read time, which
// is a worse answer than a stale one — the same reasoning the retired
// `classification` field carries in the collections vocabulary.
//
// Runs no auth.Require, for the reason ActiveColumns states: which columns exist
// is schema, and the calling engine's own row-scope clause is what protects the
// values in them.
