// A custom field this engine accepts must be one the wire can actually carry.
//
// FieldObjects used to be datasource.EntityTypes(), and that derivation was
// wrong in a way no test noticed: `object=activity` has been accepted since it
// shipped and served by nobody, because a cf_* value travels in the contract
// schema's additionalProperties bag and Activity has none. The field could be
// created, the ALTER ran, the column existed — and every read dropped it. Only
// the SPA's picker hid it, which is a screen, not a gate.
//
// So the list is explicit now, and this is what stops it over-promising again.
// The PROPERTY is derived (reflection over the generated contract structs); only
// the object → shape pairing is written down, and a member missing from that
// pairing fails rather than being skipped.
