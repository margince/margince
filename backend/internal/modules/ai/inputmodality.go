// What a bound model can be GIVEN, declared by the binding rather than by the
// adapter (ai-operational-spec §1.4).
//
// The declaration does two different jobs, depending on the wire under it.
//
// On the OpenAI-compatible adapter it is the WHOLE answer, because that adapter
// is one client pointed at an operator-chosen endpoint: whether an image may be
// sent is a property of WHICH MODEL was bound — an OpenRouter binding carries
// images for a vision model and not for a text-only one, a self-hosted vLLM only
// when the served model is one — and nothing in this package can see that.
//
// On an adapter whose carriage is fixed in its wire it NARROWS: at most what the
// wire carries, at most what was declared (narrowedCarriage). That exists for a
// privacy intent the location ladder cannot express, because `profile:` is
// all-or-nothing for the deployment — keeping scanned invoices out of an
// egressing model while keeping that model for text is per tier and per
// modality. Like `profile:`, it governs what THIS product sends; it is not a
// claim about what the operator's endpoint does with what it receives.
//
// A declaration is a claim about the endpoint, not a validated fact. A binding
// that claims more than its model serves fails on the wire — visibly, which is
// the honest failure mode and needs no second guard.

// The accepted modality words. `text` is every chat binding's baseline and
// carries no attachment; `image` is the one attachment kind this wire spells
// uniformly.
//
// `pdf` is deliberately absent. Images are one shape here — an `image_url`
// content part — while a PDF rides a proprietary request-body extension on one
// vendor and nothing at all on a self-hosted endpoint. One word meaning
// different things per vendor is the silent divergence this declaration exists
// to prevent, so `pdf` is refused by name rather than quietly accepted.

//
// `image` stays a wildcard while the adapters name their vendor's types, and
// the asymmetry is the point: this side is a PERMISSION — the operator saying
// which kinds of thing may leave their deployment — and the adapter's side is a
// DECODER. An operator writing `image` is not claiming their vendor reads SVG;
// they are declining to enumerate a vendor's list in their config, which is not
// theirs to keep current. model.IntersectMIMEs composes the two, so the binding
// gets exactly what the wire decodes and nothing the operator did not permit.
