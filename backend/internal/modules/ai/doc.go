// Package ai owns the model runtime behind the shared/ports/model seam:
// the provider adapters (Anthropic cloud-frontier BYOK, Ollama local,
// and the deterministic offline fake every test drives), the
// SelectBrain factory that turns config into a Client, and the
// credential SecretStripper that runs over every outbound payload.
//
// Model choice is config, not architecture (ADR-0020): vendor names
// appear only here and in ai-routing.yaml — callers name capability
// tiers. The stripper is hygiene, not privacy: privacy is the location
// ladder (A8 revised), so nothing here pseudonymizes PII.
//
// Tables owned: ai_usage (per-workspace metering; feeds the budget
// guardrail), voice_profile and voice_corpus_source (Voice DNA,
// B-E07.4/.5a — the derived artifact + corpus manifest are
// model-adjacent assets, so they live beside the runtime that consumes
// them), ai_call (per-attempt trace metadata — one row per rung a
// logical call walked, spec §4) and ai_call_payload (the opt-in
// post-stripper captured content, Layer 3 — the payload row that
// privacy's retention and Art. 17 erasure age out and purge).
// ai_call_config is the hash-keyed, append-only config-snapshot
// dimension every ai_call row points at; it carries no workspace_id —
// a task contract, routing yaml, and prompt version are build facts,
// not tenant data.
// ai_model_rate is the effective-dated rate sheet the read-side pricer prices
// calls against; it is workspace-independent for the same reason — a published
// provider price is a build fact, and pricing on read is what lets a corrected
// rate reprice history instead of contradicting it.
// Imports shared + platform only; never a sibling module.
