// The router's OPENING announcement: the occurrence is live, before the model
// is asked anything.
//
// railemit.go announces the other end — what a call turned out to be, once it
// was over. That was the whole rail for router-owned work, and it is why a rep
// who asked for a summary saw nothing at all and then saw "done": the only
// moment the router spoke was after the moment worth watching had passed.
//
// The unit framed here is ONE LOGICAL CALL, not one unit of work, and the
// difference is the reason this file is small. A logical call has a beginning
// the router can observe (it is about to serve it) and an end it already
// observes (the flush), so the pair needs no scope, no teardown at whatever
// mints a correlation id, and no attempt that must survive a process. For the
// tasks a person triggers and then waits on — summarize, draft_reply,
// offer_draft, all registered oneShot — the logical call IS the unit of work,
// and framing it is the whole feature.
//
// What that costs, honestly: a task whose unit of work spans MANY logical calls
// under one correlation id (the deep read's page-parallel fact lane) reopens
// its occurrence once per call, because a later call's attempt outranks the
// previous settle. The row still ends settled and nothing renders those kinds
// today, so the churn is real and invisible — but it is churn, and a unit-of-
// work frame is what would remove it rather than hide it.

//
//   - CallCeiling caps a SINGLE model call — the http.Client timeout every
//     adapter is built with.
//   - a walk of the ladder may spend that bound on EVERY rung.
//   - and CompleteStructured walks the ladder up to maxLadderWalks times for one
//     logical call: the first try, the schema-invalid retry, the escalation.
//
// The third matters because the start is announced ONCE, by construction, and
// the projection's guard refuses an equal (attempt, rank) re-announcement — so
// there is no such thing as extending this lease later. It has to cover the
// whole logical call on the day it is written. Sized for one walk, a structured
// call that legitimately retried would render stalled while it was still
// working, which is precisely the failure this derivation exists to prevent.
//
// traceWriteTimeout is added because the occurrence is settled not by the last
// rung but by the flush that follows it.
//
// A round number would be a guess that happens to look like a decision, and the
// failure it buys is silent in both directions: too short renders healthy work
// as a dead worker, too long leaves a killed process claiming to work. Neither
// is visible in a test that does not run for minutes.

// CompleteStructured threads one logicalCall through up to three serveAttempt
// calls — the first try, the schema-invalid retry, the tier escalation — and
// they are rungs of one piece of work a reader asked for once. Announcing per
// attempt would reopen the occurrence under a rising attempt twice, so the rail
// would report one request as three starts.
//
// It reads the correlation id off the SAME context value Call.CorrelationID is
// read from at flush, so the opening and closing announcements agree about
// which occurrence they describe, or neither is made.
//
// WHERE IT IS CALLED FROM is as load-bearing as what it does. serveAttempt
// calls it after the workspace check, the budget, the cache key and the profile
// — every return above those is untraced, so announcing higher would open an
// occurrence with no terminal trace behind it at all. From that point the
// deferred finalizeAttempt is armed, so the attempt APPENDS a terminal trace
// whatever it does next, and the ladder in hand is the adjusted one, so the
// lease is sized to rungs that can really run.
//
// Appending is not writing, and that gap is this placement's honest limit: the
// flush is best-effort by design (it must never fail a working model call), so
// a flush that times out — or a process that dies between the two — leaves a
// start nothing settles. The lease bounds how long such a row claims to be
// working, and aiactivity's sweep of abandoned router occurrences is what
// finally closes it. The settle is LIKELY, not guaranteed; a comment claiming
