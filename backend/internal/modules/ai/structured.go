// the rail announces a start ONCE and can never extend the lease, so the lease
// must cover the whole logical call and not one walk of it. A fourth walk added
// below without changing this would leave a healthy call rendering stalled
// before it finished, which is why TestStructuredWalksTheLadderNoMoreThanTheLeaseAssumes
// counts the walks rather than trusting this number.
