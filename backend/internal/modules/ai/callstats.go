// ServedTaskTotal is one (task, tier, provider, model) slice of served
// ai_call history — the token buckets summed and the call count, conditioned
// on the model that ACTUALLY ran. The cost estimator prices each slice at the
// model that will run it and scales it by expected units.
//
// "Served" means the provider actually ran the model and spent tokens: NOT
// cache_hit AND tokens_in > 0 AND the terminal was not a provider failure. A
// success (error_sentinel IS NULL) qualifies, and so does 'metering_failed' —
// that terminal marks a call the model ANSWERED (tokens were spent) where only
// the usage-meter write failed (see callstore.go's errMeteringFailed), so
// excluding it would understate the per-unit cost. A cache hit, a zero-token
// row, or a genuine provider error (which spent nothing billable here) is not a
// billable model invocation and must not skew the per-unit cost.
//
// Calls counts EVERY served row (successes + metering_failed retries); the token
// sums likewise span every served row, so a retry's real spend is carried.
// CompletedCalls counts only the rows that terminated cleanly (error_sentinel IS
// NULL). The distinction matters where the observed-units denominator is a call
// COUNT (enrich per contact, embed per entity): a metering_failed retry spent
// tokens but did NOT complete a fresh unit of work, so it belongs in the token
// numerator yet must not inflate the call denominator — counting it in both
// would divide its retry cost back out. CompletedCalls is that de-inflated
// denominator; Calls stays the full served count.
