// The router's report to the AI-activity projection.
//
// Every model call in this build passes through the trace flush, which is what
// makes this the one place a task cannot be missed: a task declared next year
// reports its work before its author has thought about the rail. That is the
// whole reason the default reporter is here rather than at each caller — the
// callers are the set that kept growing without anybody noticing seventeen of
// them were silent.
//
// What the router can honestly say is narrow, and the narrowness is the point:
// it learns of a call once the call is OVER, so its occurrence is settled the
// moment it appears. It never claims to be running, and it therefore never
// needs a lease. Work that deserves a live line has a durable carrier, and the
// registry in railowner.go hands the task to that carrier instead.
