// What a Router serves, and how that is replaced without restarting.

// how a call is routed; this is what it is routed AGAINST, and the two have
// different lifetimes now that the second can change under the first.

// set that must change together or not at all.
//
// It is separate from the Router because it is REPLACEABLE. Everything left on
// the Router — the meter, the budget, the call store, the metrics collector —
// is this process's, and survives a change of which models are bound; a rebind
// that reset those would lose a workspace's spend against its budget and
// restart the process-wide counters /metrics reports.
//
// Held immutably behind an atomic pointer, and never mutated in place. A call
// loads it ONCE and serves itself from that snapshot, so it cannot mix a tier
// resolved under the old binding with the config hash of the new one — which
// would file the call under a configuration that never served it.
