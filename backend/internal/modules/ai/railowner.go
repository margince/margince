// Who reports a task's work to the AI-activity projection.
//
// Every AI task this build can run must reach ai_task_run, because the rail's
// whole claim is that it says what the AI is doing for one person — and a task
// nothing reports is AI work the product performed and then denied. Seventeen
// of nineteen shipped tasks reported nothing before this registry existed, and
// no gate could see it: the parity checks in place compared two already-wired
// producers against each other, which is a question that cannot have an
// absentee for an answer.
//
// Two kinds of reporter, and the difference is what each can honestly say:
//
//   - The ROUTER reports by default. It is the one place every model call
//     passes through, so a task added next year is wired before its author has
//     thought about the rail. It learns of a call only once the call is over,
//     so a router-owned occurrence is settled the moment it appears.
//   - A CARRIER reports instead, for work that owns a durable row. Only a
//     carrier can say queued and running, and only a carrier declares the lease
//     that lets the read call a dead attempt stalled. Where one exists it is
//     the better reporter, and the router stays silent so the two never write
//     one occurrence between them.
//
// This is not a list kept beside the code. The router calls RailOwner to decide
// whether the call it just finished is its to announce, so an unanswered task
// is one the router refuses to guess about rather than one it quietly reports
// twice.
