// FakeRoutingConfig is the routing config the offline --ai-fake dev/test
// path is built over. It binds every tier a task ladder NAMES
// (local_small, cheap_cloud, premium) plus the embeddings lane to
// ProviderFake, so every task's fallback ladder is fully bound —
// UnboundLadderWarnings reports nothing for it, and no ladder is ever
// refused because --ai-fake happened to leave a tier unbound. That
// matters because TaskSiteExtract's ladder is premium-only by contract
// (no fallback rung): a fake config that skipped the premium tier would
// silently refuse deep-read extraction under --ai-fake while every
// other lane worked, an inconsistency a dev/test flag must never
// produce. The tiers no ladder names — frontier and local_large — stay
// deliberately unbound: they exist for an operator to bind, and binding
// them here would assert a fallback the contract does not declare.
// TestFakeRoutingConfigBindsEveryLadder catches the case that matters,
// a ladder rung this config cannot serve, by running the real
// UnboundLadderWarnings over it. Riding this config through NewModelPath
// (rather than FakeModelPath's direct client wiring) means --ai-fake
// exercises the real Router — tiering, the budget guardrail, metering and
// call tracing — with only the provider swapped for the deterministic fake.
