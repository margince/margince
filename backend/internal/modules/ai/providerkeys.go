// Where a provider's BYOK key lives.
//
// It was the process environment, which is the 12-factor answer and has one
// property nobody chose: an environment variable is readable for the life of
// the process by anything that can read /proc, by a crash dump, and by every
// child process the server ever forks. A key an installation holds for years
// sits in all of those the whole time.
//
// Sealed in the key vault it is at rest under AEAD, addressed by an opaque ref,
// and reachable only by a process holding the vault's root key. The root key
// still comes from the environment, so the environment does not leave the
// picture — it holds ONE secret instead of one per vendor, which is the actual
// improvement.
//
// The environment stays the way a key ARRIVES. An installation exporting
// GEMINI_API_KEY today keeps working and needs no action: the key is sealed on
// the next boot and the variable becomes a seed rather than the source. That is
// the same shape the routing file took when routing moved into the database.
