// MCP-SESS-COST from this side: what a model call costs the AGENT that caused
// it, as distinct from what it costs the workspace.
//
// The workspace's own budget is already metered next door (ai_usage, the §1.3
// utilization bands). That answers "is this installation spending too much" and
// cannot answer "is ONE connected agent spending a disproportionate share of
// it", which is the question api-rate-limits §2.2 asks. The two counters are
// different questions over the same tokens, so this records into the second
// rather than re-deriving it from the first.

// AgentTokenSpender records model tokens against the calling agent's own
// per-Passport window. It is a narrow seam rather than the volume meter itself so
// this module stays unaware of how that window is keyed or stored; compose
// bridges the two.
//
// A call with no agent principal records nothing — the implementation decides
// that, not this module, because "which callers are governed" is the volume budget's own
// rule and a second copy of it here would be a second answer.
