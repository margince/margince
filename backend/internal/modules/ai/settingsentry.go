//
// Routing is where the tier→model binding LIVES, moving it off a file read
// once at boot. The reason is not tidiness: a binding an operator can only
// change by editing a file on the server and restarting both roles is a
// binding they change rarely and out of band, and the two roles can disagree
// about it in between. In the database there is one answer, and it is the same
// answer for every role that asks.
//
// It is a setting rather than deployment config because re-pointing a tier is
// the admin's decision — it trades cost against quality for their own
// installation — and none of it is destructive or arms a capability. That is
// the line ADR-0061 §2 draws and settingscatalog_test.go enforces.

// absent, exactly as one with no routing file did. A default that named
// vendors would send an installation's text somewhere nobody chose.
//
// It SURVIVES a data reset, for the reason AsInstallationIdentity names: it is
// a value bootstrap takes from the deployment configuration, like the
// installation's name and currency. A reset wipes an installation's data, not
// the decision about which vendor may process it — and wiping it would be
// quiet, because a dev stack re-seeds the binding from its routing file on the
// next boot while a production installation, which has no file, would simply
// come back with its AI lanes gone.
