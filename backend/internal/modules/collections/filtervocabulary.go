// Reading the filter vocabulary out loud (LVS-EXT-8).
//
// The vocabulary is closed and server-owned, which is what lets a filter mean
// one thing across dynamic lists, saved views and filtered export. A builder
// screen that had to offer a field picker without asking the server would keep a
// second copy of it, and a second copy is the failure this seam exists to
// prevent: it offers a field the engine refuses, and the human learns the
// difference as a 422 nobody could have predicted.
//
// So the field set is not assembled from scratch; it starts as the engine's own
// map, read through the same SegmentEngine call that dynamic-list validation,
// membership evaluation and export all resolve through.
//
// It is not the whole of that map, and the exception is the point. What a filter
// may SAY includes a retired field, because retirement never drops the column and
// a saved segment built on one has to keep evaluating. What a builder may OFFER
// for a NEW clause excludes it — CUSTOM-FIELDS-AC-13 makes retire "hidden from
// API + filtering", and AC-14 names the admin catalogue read as the one surface
// that still shows retired fields. This is not that surface.
//
// So what this operation guarantees is a subset relation, not an equality, and it
// is worth stating precisely because the loose version is wrong: everything
// advertised here is accepted by the engine, and the gap between advertised and
// accepted is exactly the retired set. A picker built from this cannot compose a
// clause the engine refuses; a saved segment naming a retired field keeps working;
// and nothing offers a human a field an admin retired to get it out of their way.
//
// One thing a reader will look for and not find: a LABEL. Labels are
// admin-facing catalog metadata that the fieldcatalog seam keeps out of a
// filtering consumer's reach, and the custom-field catalog already serves them
// keyed by the same column name — one join, on a surface a builder screen already
// calls.

// FilterVocabulary answers every field a NEW filter clause may name for this

//
// ok is false for a resource with no engine at all — the same answer
// SegmentEngine gives, and for the same reason: activities and partners are not
// predicate-leaf resources, and the caller decides what that means.
//
// Gated as a read of `list`, the object whose filters this vocabulary describes,
// with no row-scope clause because it returns no record and no record's contents.
//
// One thing here is NOT ambient, and the line runs between schema and content.
//
// A cf_* column's NAME and TYPE are schema, and the reason they are ambient is
// the EQUIVALENCE this seam exists for, not a claim about other surfaces: a
// builder composes from what this operation lists, so a field withheld here is
// one the engine accepts and no human can name. That makes the vocabulary wrong
// about the product rather than merely quiet.
//
// It is worth being exact about what that buys, because the looser argument is
// tempting and false. Record payloads do NOT already reveal every one of these
// names — ExtractValues omits a NULL, so a custom column with no value on any
// record is invisible there and visible here. The equivalence is paid for with
// that much disclosure, deliberately: the alternative is a builder that cannot
// filter on a column until somebody happens to fill it in.
//
// A custom picklist's VALUES are the other side of the line — an admin authored
// them, they are the same content `GET /custom-fields` refuses, and they only
// began travelling here when the vocabulary started carrying options at all.
//
// So the field is listed either way and its values need `custom_field:read`
// (customPicklistValuesAreReadable). A reader without that grant keeps every
// field they could filter on and falls back to typing the value, which is the
// behaviour that stood before options travelled — never a lost capability.
//
// CORE options are unaffected: those are the contract's own enums, published in
// api/crm.yaml, so no grant can be what protects them.
//
// The gate is asked rather than inferred from the seed. Every seeded role that
// holds `list:read` also holds `custom_field:read`, but role grants are edited
// one object at a time (setRoleObjectGrant), so seed pairing is a fact about a
// fresh install and not an invariant this operation may lean on.
