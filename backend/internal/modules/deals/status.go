// in sync by the enumsync fitness gate. Domain logic branches on these
// constants, never on raw literals. The two sets share values by design
// (a stage's semantic derives the deal's status), but they are distinct
// vocabularies: a stage is never "open-ish", a deal never "a column".

// line is an AI-drafted proposal awaiting human acceptance (E03.21a):
// it never contributes to the server-computed offer totals, so a draft
// can never move a number the buyer sees. Not exposed on the contract —
// the accept transition is store-internal until a drafting surface ships.
