package deals

// A seat on a deal is a `relationship` edge, so reading one needs the edge's own
// grant on top of the deal's. The deal grant answers "may I see this deal"; the
// edge grant answers "may I learn who is on it", and the second does not follow
// from the first.
//
// Every test here passes a NIL TRANSACTION, and that is the assertion rather
// than a convenience. These reads carry their bound in an interpolated clause,
// so a version that queried first and filtered after would look correct to any
// test that inspected the returned rows — and would have read them. With no
// transaction to query, only a refusal resolved BEFORE the statement can return
// an error instead of panicking.
