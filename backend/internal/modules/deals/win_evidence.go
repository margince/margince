// Winning a deal means pointing at what was agreed, or saying why you cannot
// (ADR-0109 §6, A160).
//
// A won deal used to be a stage transition and nothing else: no signature, no
// paper, no commercial record. The number in the forecast was whatever somebody
// typed, and there was no way to ask which won deals had an agreement behind
// them.
//
// WHAT THIS REFUSES IS SILENCE, not a missing contract. Deals genuinely close
// on a purchase order, a phone call, or an import, and the product does not
// pretend otherwise — it asks which of those it was. Recording that makes the
// gap countable, and a rule with no exit would be answered by invented
// contracts, leaving data that reads as complete and is worthless.
//
// The check reads the contract table directly rather than through a port. A
// read is not a write, so it crosses no ownership boundary, and a port would
// need its own transaction — which is exactly what would let the evidence
// disappear between the check and the commit.

// hasSignedContract asks whether this deal has an agreement a human called

//
// THREE DELIBERATE CHOICES, each of which the obvious query gets wrong.
//
// The contract must have LEFT DRAFT. A draft is the state an agreement is born
// in and has asserted nothing yet, so a draft with a file stapled to it is the
// unsigned template this rule exists to refuse. `superseded` still counts —
// a renewed agreement was real when the deal closed — and so does `expired` or
// `cancelled`, because a deal won in March is not un-won when the agreement
// later ends.
//
// `signed_on` is required, not merely a contract in `contract` category: the
// category says what KIND of document a file is, and only the date says a human
// asserted it was signed.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated plainly rather than implied: every field it reads
// is written by the same principal who wins the deal, minutes earlier, in the
// same session. It is a record-keeping gate, not a proof of signature — it
// makes the honest case easy and the dishonest case deliberate, and the audit
// trail is what distinguishes them afterwards. Treating a passing gate as proof
// that somebody countersigned is the one reading of it that is wrong.
//
// The attachment must be live and in `current` or `final` state. Archive leaves
// the row in place, so an archived cancellation letter would pass an existence
// check, and a `draft` document is by its own definition not the agreement.
//
// FOR SHARE locks what it finds. The check and the write share a transaction on
// READ COMMITTED, so without the lock a concurrent archive could remove the
// evidence between the two and the deal would commit as won against nothing.
