package deals

// A deal has no (source_system, source_id) replay key, so `source` is
// the only provenance it carries — and the flip's crash repair reads it
// back to recognize deals it created but had not yet recorded in the
// identity map. That repair is safe only while no client can write the
// importer's namespace, which is what this mapper enforces.
