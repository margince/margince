package deals

// The ONE definition of "an engaged stakeholder on this deal".
//
// It was already spelled inside the deal-health engine, where the composite
// reads it. The coverage and risk surfaces (ADR-0078) need the same answer,
// and a second spelling would let two screens disagree about whether a deal is
// single-threaded — which is precisely the flag reporting.md requires to
// reconcile across every surface that shows it (REPORT-PARAM-1).
//
// Engaged means a REAL two-way exchange in the window: both an inbound and an
// outbound qualifying interaction. A one-way broadcast target is not engaged,
// however many messages we sent them, and a deal threaded only through people
// who never replied is exactly the deal this flag exists to catch.
