// The commercial-correspondence stamp seam (A165/ADR-0114, A167/ADR-0116).
//
// When a deal reaches a commercial conclusion, the correspondence already
// filed against it becomes a Handelsbrief and must be shielded from Art. 17
// erasure for the statutory period. The stamp records that the moment it is
// EARNED, and never re-derives it — because qualification is reversible in the
// product (a won deal can be reopened, a relink drops the link a derivation
// would read) and of the two ways to be wrong only one destroys data.
//
// It runs INSIDE the transaction that concludes the deal, not on the event
// bus. A subscriber would be eventually consistent, and the gap between the
// deal closing and the stamp landing is a window in which an erasure sees
// unclassified correspondence and destroys it. There is no recovering from
// that, so the stamp commits with the thing that earned it or not at all.
//
// deals may not import activities (ADR-0054), so compose injects it.
