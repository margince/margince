// The forecast's own history: what a deal's amount and close date were, when

// inside it — see recordForecastMovement and the 0215 migration for why the two
// tables stay apart.

// forecastColumns are the fields a forecast reconstruction reads. A move in any
// of them is what deal_forecast_history exists to record.
var forecastColumns = []string{amountField, currencyField, closeDateField}

// recordForecastMovement snapshots the forecast fields when an update moves one
// of them without moving the stage.
//
// deal_stage_history answers "what did this deal look like when it entered this
// stage", and it is written on creation and on a move — nowhere else. So an
// amount revised in place and a close date slipped leave no trace at all, and
// the second of those is the single most common reason a real forecast moves. A
// reconstruction built from stage history alone reconciles over stage movement
// and omits the rest while presenting itself as the whole answer: a partial sum
// wearing the label of a total, which is what finance/formulas.go already
// refuses by hand elsewhere.
//
// It writes to its own table rather than adding an arm to deal_stage_history
// because five readers hold that table to its stated meaning — health.go reads
// max(changed_at) as "when did this deal last move", the automation previews
// COUNT rows as movements — and a row that is not a transition would make every
// edited deal look freshly moved. See the migration for the full argument.
//
// The values are the deal's state AFTER the change, which is what a
// reconstruction asking "what was the forecast as of date T" needs from the
// latest row at or before T. The patch decides WHETHER to write; it already
// compared old against new, so a close date cleared or set for the first time
// counts as movement exactly as a revision does.
