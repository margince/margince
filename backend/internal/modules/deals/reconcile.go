// The overnight follow-up reconciliation pass (features/07 §8a,
// B-E06.2a): the deterministic half of the overnight agent's
// "reconcile the day's captured calls/mail/meetings into staged
// proposals" contract. Over every open deal that had a real captured
// interaction (call/mail/meeting) in the reconciliation window but has
// NO open follow-up on its timeline, the pass stages a "draft this
// follow-up" proposal — never a silent write. A human confirms (or
// edits) it in the morning approval inbox; only then is the follow-up
// task created. It follows the close-date corrector's shape exactly:
// one read pass per live workspace, the truth decided in Go over an
// injectable clock, staging through an approvals seam the composition
// root fills, and the confirm effect owned there too.
//
// Scope note (B-E06.2a): the value-judgement proposals in §8a — a stage
// / next-step / amount change inferred from what was SAID on a call —
// are model reasoning (ai-operational-spec §3.2, AIUC-15) that ride the
// Surface-B runner, not this deterministic sweep; the corrected
// expected_close_date is already the close-date corrector's job
// (formulas §11). This pass owns the one reconciliation discrepancy that
// is honestly deterministic: a real interaction with no next step
// planned.
