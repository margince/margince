// Which acts an agent may perform on a Deal Room, held at the store rather than
// only at the transport.
//
// The contract already marks the human-only operations, and the REST gate
// refuses an agent principal on them. Both are real, and neither reaches a
// caller inside the process — a compose orchestration, or the buyer edge when it
// lands, would pass the transport gate by never meeting it. So the rule is
// asserted here, against the store, where a new caller cannot route around it.
//
// The division: OPENING a room is auto-execute, because a room nobody has been
// invited to is readable by nobody. Everything an outside party can then reach
// — the wording, the documents, who holds a seat, how long they hold it — is a
// person's. A room is live from creation, so there is no longer a draft an
// agent could shape unseen.
