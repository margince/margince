// Delivery state answers "did the invitation arrive?", which is a different
// question from "may this person in?" — and the whole reason the two are
// modelled apart is that a seller chasing silence has to tell a bounce from a
// deliberate removal.
//
// These cases are the ones where a wrong answer sends somebody down the wrong
// path: reporting `sent` for a bounce, or for a person who was revoked.
