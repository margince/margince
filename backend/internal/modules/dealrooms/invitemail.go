// cache key. The server therefore never sees it in a URL at all — it arrives in
// a POST body when the buyer's browser exchanges it.
//
// This is containment, not a guarantee, and the exception is routine rather than
// hypothetical: click-tracking mail gateways rewrite whole URLs into their own
// query strings, fragment included, so the credential lands in a third party's
// request line whichever form we choose. The identity module says the same about
// its set-password links. What actually bounds the exposure is that a credential
// is single-use and short-lived, not the shape of the URL carrying it.

// may be forwarded onward, so it carries only what a recipient needs to act on.
//
// It also tells them their activity in the room is visible to the people
// managing it — which is the honest scope: the roster is read by anybody
// holding deal_room read on the room, not by the inviter alone. The room records when they sign in and which documents they
// take, and the person that is recorded about is told so before they do it —
// in the invitation rather than on the room screen, so it reaches them before
// the first act rather than at the moment of it.
