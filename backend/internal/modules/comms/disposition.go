// It KEEPS the attempt, unlike the pacing deferral below, and the difference is

// not a failure to ask — so this was a transmission attempt to both readers of
// the counter, and it must be bounded like one. Giving the rung back here would
// leave a throttled delivery snoozing forever: MailboxRatePolicy meters only
// successful sends, so the policy chain keeps saying "go now" and never reaches
// its own maximum-age park, and the caller's ladder is restored by the very
// snooze this asks for. Nothing else would ever move the row.
//

// DispatchWithWait for two reasons. That guard runs before transmit, so it
