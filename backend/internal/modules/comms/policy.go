// delivery that is asked and then deferred (by an earlier policy in the

// The wait returned is always a full window, not the time remaining in the
// caller's current one: the limiter has no way to report that remainder, so
// a delivery that hits the limit near the end of its window waits longer
// than strictly necessary. That is a latency cost, not a correctness one —
// the next attempt, a full window later, is always past the boundary.
