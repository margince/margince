// THE RECEIPT STANDS. Once the provider has accepted a message, the record that
// it did must survive everything that can go wrong afterwards — a seam that
// refuses, a statement Postgres aborts, a transaction that cannot be committed,
// a cancelled job, a panic, and the fault report's own failure. Each case here
// is one of those, and each asserts the same two facts: the delivery is durably
// sent, and RecordSent reported nothing the dispatcher could retry on.
//
// The stakes are why this is a suite rather than a case. A receipt that fails
// to record sends the delivery back to River, whose prior-send lookup searches
// for an identity Gmail discarded — it finds nothing, and the recipient is
// mailed a second time. The fixture, and what RecordSent does when nothing goes
// wrong, live next door in store_recordsent_integration_test.go.
