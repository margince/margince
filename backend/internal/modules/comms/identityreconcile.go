// The identity reconcile, and everything that keeps it from costing a second
// email. It is one concept and it lives in one file: the receipt for a message
// the provider has ALREADY accepted is committed and gone by the time any of
// this runs, so every path here — a refusing seam, an aborted statement, a lost
// connection, a panic, and the fault report itself — has to end in "the receipt
// stands, one duplicate timeline row". store.go owns the delivery lifecycle;
// this owns the correction that follows it in a transaction of its own.

// errNoReconciler names a store built with no message-identity seam at all.
// nil stays constructible because a role that only READS deliveries has no
// timeline row to re-key and should not have to drag the seam in to say so —
// but a role that TRANSMITS and cannot reconcile is a wiring mistake, which
// the composition's own fitness test is what catches before it ships.
//
// At runtime it is treated as what it is: one more reconcile fault, degrading
// to "receipt recorded, one duplicate timeline row" like every other. Letting
// it reach the transaction instead would dereference nil inside it. The recover
// boundary would catch that panic like any other, so the cost is the same — but
// the breadcrumb would then read "the reconcile panicked" about a store that
// was misbuilt at composition time, which is not what an operator needs to be
// told. Checked here, the report names the actual fault.

// key on. Recorded like every other reconcile fault — the receipt stands, the
// message keeps the identity it was staged under.

// failing it — is the one thing that must never happen. The breadcrumb is what

// escaping this function would unwind the dispatch attempt, fail the job, and
// let the redelivery transmit an already-accepted message a second time — so
// the guard has to cover the fault report and the transaction plumbing too,
// which is where a panic is least expected and therefore most likely to be
// let through. Nothing on this path visibly panics today; the boundary is
// structural, because the consequence is the same whatever the shape of the
// fault or the year it is introduced in.
