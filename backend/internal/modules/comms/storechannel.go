// The channel-shaped half of the comms_outbound seam (telegram-oa design §8.3).
// It writes the same table, into the same status machine, for the same
// dispatcher and the same retry ladder — only the columns differ, because a
// messaging channel has no RFC822 identity, no subject and no address lists.
//
// It lives beside StageTx rather than inside it: comms_outbound admits a
// mail-shaped row or a channel-shaped one and never half of each
// (comms_outbound_shape, 0155), and TWO input types is how that invariant
// reaches Go. One struct with a mode flag could name a subject and a channel
// recipient together, and the only thing left to refuse it would be the
// database — after the caller had already decided to write.
