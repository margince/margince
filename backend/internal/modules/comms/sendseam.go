// The dispatcher's ONE branch on provider class (telegram-oa design §8.3), and
// the at-most-once guard that branch turns on (§8.4).
//
// Everything about a delivery that depends on its SHAPE is settled here and
// nowhere else: which credential authorizes it, which provider call transmits
// it, and whether a retry of that call could ever discover that an earlier
// attempt already went. Past this file the authority gate, the seat gate, the
// consent gate, the pacing chain, the retry ladder and the four dispositions are
// one code path for mail and for a messaging channel alike.
//
// Keeping it to one branch is not tidiness. A second branch downstream would be
// two send paths wearing one name, and the one exercised less — the channel, by
// a wide margin — is the one that would quietly stop matching the rules the mail
// path keeps.
