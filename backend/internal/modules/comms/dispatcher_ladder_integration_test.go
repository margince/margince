// attempts counts TRANSMISSION attempts, over the real counter.
//
// Two readers depend on that meaning: the exhaustion guard, which parks a
// delivery whose ladder is spent, and the connector's prior-send lookup, which
// fires on a non-zero count because a previous attempt may already have put
// the message on the wire. The line between the two deferrals is therefore
// whether the message reached a provider at all:
//
//   - a PACING deferral never handed anything to a provider, so it must consume
//     no rung — otherwise a merely BUSY mailbox parks legitimate mail as "ladder
//     exhausted" after N windows without ever having been attempted, and the
//     configured maximum-age bound becomes unreachable;
//   - a PROVIDER THROTTLE did reach the provider — a 429 is its answer — so it
//     keeps its rung. Restoring it there would leave the delivery snoozing
//     forever: the rate policy meters only successful sends, so its own age
//     park is never reached, and the caller's ladder is restored by the snooze.
//
// Both halves are pinned here, because either one read the other's way is a row
// that never resolves or mail that dies for being popular.
//
// The fixture (setupStore/stage/baseInput) lives in store_integration_test.go;
// the fake sender/resolver/consent in dispatcher_test.go.
