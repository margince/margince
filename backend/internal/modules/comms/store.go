// RecordSent closes a delivery against the provider's receipt, and — only once

// provider actually stamped.
//
// TWO transactions, and which fact is in which is the safety property rather
// than an implementation detail. By the time this is called the provider has
// accepted the message, so an obligation exists that nothing here may revoke:
// leaving the delivery pending sends it back to River, and the connector's
// prior-send lookup cannot see an identity the provider discarded — it finds
// nothing and transmits again. The receipt therefore goes in first, alone, in a
// transaction that carries no bookkeeping it could fail with. Everything after
// it is best effort and reports nothing: a reconcile fault degrades to "receipt
// recorded, one duplicate timeline row", which is exactly the behaviour that
// existed before the re-key did.
//
// That reasoning covers MAIL, whose prior-send lookup makes a failed receipt
// recoverable on the next attempt. It does not cover a transport that has none:
// there, a failed receipt is unrecoverable by any later attempt, so the
// dispatcher parks the delivery against the receipt (ParkTransmitted) instead of
// returning it to the ladder. Either way the obligation this comment opens with
// is the same one — a message the provider accepted may never end up recorded as
// unsent.
//
// One transaction with the re-key under a savepoint is NOT the same guarantee,
// which is why it is not what this does. A savepoint isolates a refused
// statement; it does not isolate a failed RELEASE, a rollback that cannot be
// issued, a dropped connection, or a panic raised outside the guarded call. Any
// of those leaves the receipt as an uncommitted UPDATE in a transaction that
// then fails to commit — the error reaches the dispatcher, and the double-send
// is back. Committed first, the receipt cannot be taken back by anything the
// reconcile does.
//
// Both run under a context DETACHED from the caller's (detachedWrite): the job
// deadline expiring, or the worker being cancelled, mid-send is not permission
// to forget that a real message left the building.
//
// Guarded on status = 'pending': a stale attempt (network partition, GC pause)
// can lose a race against a newer attempt that already closed the same row.
// Rather than clobber a 'sent' or 'parked' row — a real receipt overwritten,
// or worse, un-sent by a stale park — a delivery that is no longer pending
// reports ErrTerminal. That is a benign no-op, the same fact Load already
// reports the same way: the dispatcher must treat it as "already handled,"
// never as retryable. Zero rows also means no re-key: there is no receipt here
