// the row is mail-shaped or channel-shaped and never half of each
// (comms_outbound_shape, 0155).
//
// On a channel delivery the mail fields read as their ZERO VALUES rather than as
// pointers, because a channel genuinely has no subject and no RFC822 identity —
// there is no second fact for a nil to carry that an empty string does not
// already say. ChannelUserID is the one exception, and its own comment says why.
// IsChannel is the ONE spelling of "which shape is this".
