// does not transmit the covering text alone. Stripping is the one behaviour the
// ADR exists to forbid, because the failure is silent: the sender sees a
// timeline entry with an attachment chip — the timeline records what was STAGED
// — the recipient sees a message referring to a file that is not there, and
// nobody is told. The record of what was sent is then permanently wrong, so even
// a later investigation reconstructs the wrong history.
//
// Parking rather than refusing outright is deliberate too: the composer already
// knows the channel's capability and warns before the human presses send, so a
// mismatch HERE means something changed after staging — a channel reconnected as
// a different provider, a file added by a later edit. The human should get the
// message back with a reason, which is what parking does.

// in one message, how large each may be, and — for a transport that carries
// text-with-files as a caption — how long the covering text may be. All four are
// the provider's own limits, published on the channel directory so the composer
// warns first, and every one of them parks for the same reason: a message that
// went out missing a file, or truncated to fit a caption, is not the message a
