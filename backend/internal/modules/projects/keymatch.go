// a seam compose injects, never by importing this package.

// Two DISTINCT projects matched means the subject is ambiguous and the answer
// is no project: the ladder has no human in it, so a coin flip here would file
// a message under the wrong body of work with nothing to catch it. Several
// tokens matching the SAME project is not ambiguity — a subject may repeat its
// key in the prefix and the prose.
//
// Archived projects are excluded because a key is unique among LIVE rows only
// (uq_project_key): once a project is archived its key can be reused, so
// matching an archived row could file today's mail under last year's work.
