// What CHANGED about a contact's relationship, gathered for the pure
// derivation in shared/kernel/relstrength.
//
// No table backs this and none should. The arithmetic that produces the
// current score is a fold over the person's own interactions, so folding the
// same curve over a window that ends in the past recovers what the score WAS —
// and the difference is the change. A stored change log would be a second copy
// of a fact the activities already carry, with its own erasure surface, its own
// replay-safety question and its own way of disagreeing with the timeline
// beside it.
//
// The cost is one extra pass over one person's interactions, which is the same
// order as the timeline query rendered next to it.
