// Contract request → store input, and store row → contract response, for
// relationship edges — in ONE place, because two surfaces now decode these
// shapes: the HTTP handlers and the SoR provider the MCP tool surface comes
// through. While the mapping was inline in the handler there was only one
// caller and one place to be wrong; there are two now, and a defaulting rule in
// only one of them makes the surfaces silently disagree.
//
// Extracting it found a defect that had been live on the REST path the whole
// time: the create handler never read `project_id`, and the response never
// rendered it. So `POST /v1/relationships` with kind=project_stakeholder — a
// member of the contract's own kind enum — lost its project endpoint on the way
// in and died on rel_project_stakeholder_shape, blaming a pair the caller had
// supplied. Copying that into the provider would have shipped it twice.
