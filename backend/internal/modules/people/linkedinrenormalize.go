// Re-normalizing stored LinkedIn company keys (ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// `linkedin_connection.normalized_company` is a DERIVED column and it is part
// of the natural dedupe key (uq_linkedin_connection_natural). That pairing has
// a consequence which is easy to miss and expensive to discover: changing the
// normalizer changes the key, so the same connection stops matching the row it
// already has and a re-import inserts a second copy of it.
//
// That is not hypothetical — it happened. Cleaning LinkedIn's headline company
// field ("najahak.io | نجاحك" → "najahak.io") altered the key for every row
// whose company carried a tagline, and re-importing the same export produced
// 209 duplicate connections on a real workspace. Every org-level reach count
// those rows feed was then double-counted.
//
// So a normalizer change owes a backfill, and this is it: recompute every
// stored key from the CURRENT normalizer, and collapse the rows that then
// collide. It is idempotent — a workspace already re-normalized costs one scan
// and writes nothing — so it can run on every boot without a version flag to
// forget to bump.
