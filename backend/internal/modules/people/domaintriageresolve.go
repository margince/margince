// rather than from the raw domain label, with an employment edge for every

//
// One transaction: the verdict, the organization, its domain, the edges, the
// dossier's findings and the dossier binding all commit together or not at all.
// A ledger row reading 'company' beside no organization would be a lie the
// ensure ladder then acts on.
