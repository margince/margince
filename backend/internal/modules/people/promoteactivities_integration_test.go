// Promotion carries the lead's timeline onto the person it became
// (LEADS-FORM-5 step 3: "the lead's history, provenance, and activities carry
// over with nothing orphaned").
//
// This needs a database because the link row is CONVERTED rather than
// repointed: activity_link_shape admits exactly one target per row, so a row
// that kept lead_id while gaining person_id violates the CHECK, and
// uq_activity_link rejects a converted row that duplicates a link the person
// already had. Both are constraint interplay no unit test sees.
//
// The failure this guards is silent and total. Before the carry existed, every
// note and task a rep logged against a lead stayed on the retired lead row: the
// person's timeline was empty, and the lead's page had already redirected away.
// Nothing errored.
