// It sits beside the minting half rather than inside it because the two settle
// different questions. Minting decides who a stranger is; this decides that a
// human already on the books is the same human, and then attaches the account
// they can be answered at to the record that already describes them. The second
// is the one that writes onto a row somebody else created, which is why it
// carries the settle, the lock and the audit the first does not need.
