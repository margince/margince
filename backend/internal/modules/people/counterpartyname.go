// Naming a counterparty from what the INSTALLATION knows, when the header does
// not say enough on its own.
//
// personname.go reads one message's header and is deliberately willing to
// abstain: a display name of "Lars" is one token, and one token is a first
// name, a surname or a nickname with nothing to say which. That is the right
// answer for a stranger and the wrong one for somebody the workspace already
// has on file — mail from lars@jankowfsky.de is not a mystery when there is an
// app_user row with that address and a full name a person typed.
//
// So this file is the second question, asked only when the first abstains:
// does this installation already know who this is.
