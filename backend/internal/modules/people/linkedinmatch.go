// Matching LinkedIn ghosts to CRM records (ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// A ghost is a name, maybe a company, and — on CSV rows where the connection
// allowed it — an address. Turning that into "this colleague knows THIS
// contact" is a dedupe problem, and it obeys the same rule the rest of this
// module obeys: **only an email address is an exact person key.**
//
// So there are exactly two outcomes and one of them needs a human:
//
//	EXACT EMAIL      → confirmed automatically. An address is identity here,
//	                   the same way it is on the capture path.
//	NAME + EMPLOYER  → suggested. It agrees often enough to be worth showing
//	                   and wrongly often enough that auto-confirming would
//	                   quietly attach a stranger to a customer record. There
//	                   are two Andreas Müllers at every large German firm.
//
// Nothing here ever CREATES a person. A ghost that matches nothing stays a
// ghost, and its only contribution is the org-level count — "someone here is
// connected to 3 people at this account" — which needs no identity at all.

// MatchLinkedInConnectionsForPerson matches the unmatched ghosts against ONE

//
// A workspace does not learn its contacts all at once. An export is uploaded
// during onboarding, and the people it could match are created over the
// following hours and weeks — by mail capture, by a site read, by a rep typing
// a name in. Every one of those is a chance to attach a ghost that the upload
// could not have attached, and asking each writer to remember to call the
// matcher would guarantee that one of them forgets.
//
// So the trigger is the EVENT every writer already emits. person.created and
// person.updated flow through the outbox because the write shape puts them
// there, and the cg:graph-edge consumer turns them into this call. Manual
// entry, capture, site read, merge and import all reach it without any of them
// knowing this function exists.
//
// Scoped to the one person so the cost is proportional to the change: a
// workspace-wide pass per person event would re-scan every unmatched ghost
// thousands of times during a capture backfill.
//
// owner narrows the email/name-and-employer arms to that ONE member's
// ghosts — the same narrowing MatchLinkedInConnections applies via its own
// owner parameter. The caller (compose/linkedinmatchgen.go's matchPerson)
// already runs this once per ghost owner under that owner's real principal
// precisely so a match is decided by the ghost owner's authority (see
// ghostOwnerCapturePrivacy's doc above); passing ids.Nil here — SQL NULL,
// "every owner" — would match every member's ghosts under whichever
// member's row scope the loop currently binds, turning a guessed address
// uploaded as an owner-private ghost into a contact-existence oracle: wait
// for a broader-scoped colleague's pass to reach it, then read
// match_status to learn a contact you cannot see exists.
