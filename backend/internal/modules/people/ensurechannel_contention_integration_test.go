// Generous enough that only a genuine miss trips it, short enough that the miss
// reports itself rather than running into the package timeout, where it would
// read as a hung suite instead of a stated fact. THAT is the ceiling, and it is
// arithmetic rather than taste: five call sites in this package can each spend
// this budget, against the lane's 600s per-package timeout
// (INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT). At 90s a run in which every one of them misses spends

// budget and the last miss is cut off mid-sentence by the timeout, which is the
// failure this comment exists to prevent. Raise this number and that sum moves
// with it.
//
// This number covers a merely slow runner and nothing else. It is deliberately
