// Which stored facts contradict themselves.
//
// The site extractor picks a fact's FIELD from a closed per-page menu, and the
// CATEGORY is derived from the field — so an out-of-menu field cannot be
// generated at all. What it cannot prevent is the right field carrying the
// wrong KIND of value: a phone number on a contact page lands as `location`
// because a contact page's menu offers both, and a commercial-register number
// lands as `employee_range` because both are digits. The row passes every gate
// and is still wrong, and it is wrong in a way a human spots instantly.
//
// So this names the contradiction rather than trying to prevent it. It reads
// the value's SHAPE and reports why it disagrees with its field. It is
// deliberately narrow: each rule fires only on a shape that is unambiguous,
// because a false flag on a real fact teaches the reader to ignore the flag.
//
// It never hides or rewrites a fact. A heuristic that suppressed data would be
// worse than the miscategorization it is chasing — the evidence is still
// there, still cited, and a human decides.
