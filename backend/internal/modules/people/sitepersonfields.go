// Auto-filling a site person onto a person the workspace ALREADY has
// (ADR-0072/A118 phase 4B).
//
// A deep read of a company's team page publishes people. A stranger among them
// stages as a lead and stays staged (ADR-0008, NEVER-8) — that boundary does not
// move. But when the published person is unmistakably someone the workspace
// already records at that company, staging a lead offers a human a duplicate of
// a record they already have, and the role the site prints next to their name
// goes unused.
//
// "Unmistakably" is deliberately narrow, and it is the whole safety argument:
//
//   - an exact live email match among that organization's own employees, or
//   - exactly ONE employee of that organization whose name matches confidently.
//
// Zero matches, or more than one, means the site person is not identifiable and
// the lead stages exactly as before. The scope is the organization's employees
// rather than the workspace, because the site is claiming this person works
// THERE: filling a title from company X's site onto a person the CRM records at
// company Y is a conflict a human should see, not one a sweep should settle.
//
// Everything written is fill-only-empty and evidence-backed, so a human's answer
// is structurally untouchable and a re-read applies nothing twice.
