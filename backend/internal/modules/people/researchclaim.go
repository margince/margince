// What a human accepted from a research run (ADR-0096 D4).
//
// This is the ONLY write in the whole research surface. A run stages and
// touches nothing; the record changes here, once somebody has read the claims
// and chosen which of them are true.
//
// It lands in person_profile_field, the same table the signature-enrichment
// pass writes: a fact about who this person IS, with the evidence it was read
// from. That table's shape is what makes the guarantee enforceable rather than
// promised — evidence_snippet and source_ref are both NOT NULL, so a claim
// that lost its quote or its source cannot be stored at all.
//
// captured_by names the HUMAN who accepted it, not the provider that proposed
// it. The provider's URL rides source_ref, so the chain from record to document
// stays intact; but the decision was a person's, and the record says so.
