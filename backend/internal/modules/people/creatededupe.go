// Manual creates meeting the PO-F chokepoint (dedupe.go) under the
// manual policy, which is stated per LANE because the exact tier does
// not give one answer (telegram-oa design §7.3 asks every caller for
// exactly this):
//
//   - A claimed EMAIL refuses. ensurePersonEmailsUnclaimed answers that
//     tier with the 409 contract before the chokepoint even runs, and
//     the unique index is the structural backstop under a race — so by
//     the time the ladder reads, the email lane has nothing left to say.
//   - A shared PHONE does not refuse. A household line or a switchboard
//     belongs to several real, different people, and the create contract
//     promises a 409 on an address alone (data-model §3.2). It creates
//     AND records: an exact hit routes PAST the fuzzy tier (routeExact
//     returns before scoring), so without a recording arm of its own a
//     create sharing a number with an existing record would leave LESS
//     trail than one that merely looked similar.
//   - A FUZZY near-match creates AND records — a probability never
//     blocks a human, but the pair must not vanish either.
//
// A manual create never sees routeExact's lane CONFLICT: two exact lanes
// must hit for that, a create carries no channel identity, and a claimed
// address has already been refused — so the phone is the only lane left
// to speak, and one voice cannot disagree.
//
// A recording is the DH-DDL-1 review queue itself (an open
// dedupe_candidate row the human dispositions); the fuzzy arm adds the
// append-only system_log ledger line for the score it acted on. Both sit
// inside the create's own transaction, so the record and its review
// trail commit or roll back together.
