// role's privileges, so it can read no more than a direct SELECT on deal
// could from here.
//
// What bounds the SUM is the key, not the transaction. Since core 0217
// (ADR-0091) there is no tenant-isolation policy behind either the view or
// deal, so the GUC the transaction binds constrains this statement only
// through predicates a statement writes for itself — and this one writes
// none beyond organization_id. That is sufficient here and it is worth
// saying why rather than leaving it to look like an omission: every deal
// the view sums reaches this organization through its own foreign key, so
// the id IS the scope, and A107/ADR-0061 gives the installation one
// organization for that id to belong to.

// read touches carry no tenant column, and a join on one would only re-derive
