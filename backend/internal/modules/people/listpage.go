// writes its profile. Asking who created it misses exactly the records worth
// reviewing.
//
// The predicate is the AUDIT LOG, because that is the only source that is
// complete by construction. Every mutation in this system commits its domain
// row, its audit row and its outbox row in ONE transaction — the write shape is
// non-negotiable and enforced at the one store chokepoint — so no agent write
// can reach a record without leaving an audit row naming who made it. Anything
// narrower is a list someone has to maintain: an earlier cut of this predicate
// enumerated the two dossier evidence tables and the promoted-name column, and
// silently missed an agent updating an ordinary column, which is the plainest
// case there is.

// It matches on `actor_id`, not `actor_type`. The two are different axes:
// `actor_type` is the principal MECHANISM (a background job runs as `system`)

// everywhere else. The deep-read worker is a system principal whose identity is
// `agent:deepread`, so typing on the mechanism would miss every AI enrichment
// this filter exists to surface.
//
// The record's own `captured_by` is kept as a second arm. It is subsumed by the
// audit row for the create, and it is on the row itself — so it still answers
// after audit retention has pruned old rows, which is this predicate's one real
// limit and is stated rather than papered over.
//
// No partial index backs this. `idx_audit_entity` (workspace_id, entity_type,
// entity_id) already serves the lookup; a partial index on the agent prefix
// could not be used anyway, because the prefix arrives as a bind parameter and
// the planner cannot prove a bound value implies the index predicate. Building
