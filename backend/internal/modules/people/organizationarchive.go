// Retiring an account, and everything hanging off it.
//
// Archiving an organization is not one row: the domains it claims, the
// relationship types it wears, the partner program it is enrolled in and the
// edges it sits on all have to retire with it, or a dead account keeps
// answering the lists those tables feed. That is a concept of its own, which
// is why it lives beside the CRUD rather than inside it.

// So an archive staged against the installation's own company is refused by
// the store every single time — leaving it out would spend a human's approval
// on the one target that can never succeed.
