// What a company IS to us (PO-DDL-4b, ADR-0079/A124) — the multi-valued half
// of the split that retired organization.classification.
//
// It is multi-valued because a company is legitimately several things at once:
// the partner program (A38/ADR-0030) is built on companies that are
// simultaneously partners and customers, and an agency is often a reseller and
// a client. The single enum could hold one of those and silently erased the
// rest.
//
// The rows are an owned child of the organization, written only through the
// organization's own gated paths — the patch below and the partner upsert —
// which is the visibility decision the schema fitness gate records.
