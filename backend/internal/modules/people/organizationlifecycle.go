// Moving an account's stage from a decision a human already made.
//
// The ordinary path is UpdateOrganization, which takes a caller's sparse edit
// and an If-Match version. A released approval carries neither: it carries the
// stage the proposal named and the stage the record was in when it was staged,
// and it must write only if the record still says the second.
//
// That is the SECOND of two checks, not the only one. The approval itself is
// pinned to the organization's version, so Redeem refuses a decision made
// against a row that changed at all — including by an edit that never touched
// the stage. This CAS is what remains after that: the narrower question of
// whether the stage in particular is still what the proposal was built on. It
// exists because the two can disagree, and because a writer reached from an
// effect must not assume the caller above it checked anything.
