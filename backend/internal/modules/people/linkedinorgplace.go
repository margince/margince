// Placing a ghost at an account (ADR-0078 §2.1b) — the employer half of the
// matcher, split from the person half so each file holds one concept.
//
// It answers the weaker of the two questions the import exists for: not "who
// is this person" but "does this connection work somewhere we sell to". A
// wrong answer here misattributes a reach count; a wrong answer on the person
// side attaches a stranger to a customer record. The two carry different
// evidence bars for that reason.
