// StrengthForPeopleAsOf over a real Postgres: what §4 WOULD have said at a
// past instant. It is what "this relationship is going cold" compares against
// — today's score against the same contact's score a month ago — and it does
// it without a snapshot table.
//
// The two properties that make it usable, and the one that makes it honest:
//
//   - it excludes interactions that happened AFTER the instant asked about,
//     or every past score would equal today's and no decay would ever show;
//   - it still reads the window relative to that instant, so a contact who
//     was busy then scores as busy then;
//   - and it is a counterfactual over TODAY's corpus, not a recording. An
//     erased interaction is absent from the past answer too, which is the
//     behaviour we want: a score must not become a way to read deleted data.
