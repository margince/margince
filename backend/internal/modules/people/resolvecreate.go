// The identity chokepoint: the ONE place a person row and the ONE place an
// organization row is minted. Four person paths and four organization paths
// used to each own their own INSERT, and they drifted — capture asked PO-F-2
// about a domain and never about a name, cold start never asked at all, lead
// promotion probed one column by hand. Two companies in a real workspace ended
// up doubled because of it.
//
// Both functions take the PO-F ladder's verdict as an ARGUMENT, and that is
// the point: a create that never consulted dedupe.go cannot be written,
// because there is no verdict to hand over. The verdict is not decoration
// either — an exact-key collision means the record already exists, and these
// functions refuse to mint a second one rather than trusting every caller to
// remember.
//
// What stays with the caller: the RBAC gate, the audit row and the outbox
// event (a promotion audits as `promote`, not `create`), the review-trail
// recording with its per-lane evidence, and the read-back. The write shape is
// unchanged — these run on the caller's transaction, so domain row, audit and
// outbox still commit together.
//
// `backend/gates/dedupespine_test.go` is what keeps this the only door.
