// Importing a LinkedIn Connections.csv as GHOSTS (CG-DDL-2 / ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// Every LinkedIn member can export their own connections without any API
// approval, which is why this path exists first: it works today, and the
// Member Data Portability API becomes a second writer onto the same rows once
// LinkedIn approves a developer app.
//
// The imported rows are NOT people. They never reach search, lists, the people
// screens, or the assistant's record tools, and nothing can write to them.
// That is the safety property the whole feature rests on: an export is a list
// of third parties who never agreed to be in anyone's CRM, and turning three
// thousand of them into contacts would be a consent problem and a data-quality
// catastrophe at the same time. They exist to answer one question — does
// anyone here already know someone at this company.
