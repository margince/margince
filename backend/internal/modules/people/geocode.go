// Turning a company's address into a point, and keeping the two honest about
// each other.
//
// THE HARD PART IS NOT THE LOOKUP, it is staleness. A company's address can
// change at any time, and its coordinates cannot change in the same
// transaction — the lookup leaves the process and takes seconds. So there is
// always a window where the row holds an address and the coordinates of a
// DIFFERENT address, and a radius query that read lat/lon alone would answer
// with distances from where the company used to be, reporting success.
//
// geocode_status closes it. The writer stamps 'stale' in the same transaction
// as the address change, the worker sets 'ok' when it catches up, and only
// 'ok' is queryable. A company mid-move drops out of radius answers rather
// than appearing in the wrong place — an omission a caller can be told about,
// instead of a wrong answer they cannot see.
