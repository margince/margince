// Whether a domain may have a company AT ALL — a standing decision, held apart
// from the crawl that would answer what company it is.
//
// The triage beside this file asks "what does this domain's site say"; these
// functions answer a question no amount of crawling can settle. A vendor the
// business merely uses has a real corporate website, so every piece of evidence
// says "company" and only a decision says otherwise. That makes admission a
// property of the DOMAIN rather than of any sender or any read, which is why it
// outlives both.
//
// A human decision is sticky by design: an admin who lets a domain in keeps it
// in, however much bulk mail arrives afterwards.
