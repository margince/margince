// A uniqueness refusal on a relationship carries two facts, and callers need
// both: the SENTINEL, so the transport answers 409, and the CONSTRAINT, so a
// caller that races itself can tell which rule refused it and recover.
//
// It must carry them WITHOUT the driver error. A *pgconn.PgError anywhere in
// the chain makes httperr read the refusal as an infrastructure fault — the
// client's detail is blanked and every ordinary duplicate logs at ERROR — and
// the agent runner echoes err.Error() into its transcript, which would put
// SQLSTATE text into a model prompt.
