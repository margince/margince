// The channel counterparty auto-create engine (telegram-oa design §6.4): the
// sibling of EnsureCounterparty for an inbound channel message, whose human is
// named by a provider identity rather than by an address.
//
// It is a SIBLING and not a widening because every load-bearing step of the
// mail path is mail-shaped. That path refuses an empty address, derives the
// display name from the address's local part, owns its rows through the
// granting human, writes an email satellite, derives a company from the mail
// domain, and quarantines on domain-shaped impersonation tells. A channel
// message supplies none of those inputs, and a workspace bot has no granting
// human at all: it serves the whole workspace, so the person it creates is
// OWNERLESS and workspace-visible (design D2 — a deliberate divergence from
// ADR-0063's owner-visible connector records, raised upstream, because
// attributing the record to whoever ran Connect would fill that admin's
// pipeline with conversations they never had).
//
// What it shares with the mail path is what must not fork: the ONE dedupe
// chokepoint (PO-F-1), the erasure-suppression refusal, and the activity link.

// leaves no audit row either, which is why the trail records handle CHANGES
// rather than one line per inbound message.

// one-statement shape — an UPDATE joined to a subquery holding the old value —

// resumed against a newer row version. Two messages from a renaming sender are
// in flight at once often enough for that to bite, and the second would then
