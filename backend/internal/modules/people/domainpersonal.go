// The sender-name heuristic: does this domain's own label say it belongs to a
// person rather than a company? It answers only when the triage crawl could not
// — an unreachable site, a domain that resolves to nothing — because a read
// site is always better evidence than a name coincidence.
//
// It is the last line before falling back to creating a company. Getting it
// wrong in one direction costs a real one-person consultancy its company
// row; in the other it manufactures a company named after a human. So the rule
// is deliberately narrow: the domain's registrable label must BE somebody's
// name, spelled the way people spell their own domains.

// name as captured, and the local parts of EVERY address they hold on it. Both
// matter — "Ines Marsh" writing from rowan@rowanmarsh.example is only explained
// by joining the local part to the surname.
//
// The locals are a list because a person often has two mailboxes on their own
// domain. One entry per ADDRESS would make those look like two different
// people, and since the test below requires every person to be explained, a
// second mailbox would silently turn a personal domain into a company.
