// literal compiles and misbehaves silently, a typo'd constant does not
// exist.

// The open states are a ladder the system climbs from captured activity
// (new → contacted when we reach out → engaged when they answer or a
// meeting is booked or held) and a human may place by hand; the terminal
// pair is reached only through the governed promote and disqualify paths.
