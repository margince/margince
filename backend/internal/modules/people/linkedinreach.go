// Which accounts a member's imported network reaches (ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// This is the ONE question the ghosts exist to answer, and until now nothing
// asked it. A member could see that 5,064 connections had been imported and
// that 267 of them resolved to accounts, and could not see WHICH accounts —
// so the import produced a number rather than an answer.
//
// It is also the half of the feature that works on a one-person workspace. The
// company page's connections card asks which COLLEAGUE knows an account, which
// has no content when there is one member; this asks whether the member's own
// network reaches it, which has content immediately.
