// Which organization writers actually wait on the name lock, judged at the CALL
// SITE rather than on the helper that decides it.
//
// Which lock a writer holds, and in which order, is a property of the
// transaction rather than of any predicate, so it is measured here rather than
// asserted about a helper: the lock is held by hand in one transaction, the
// write runs in another, and Postgres is asked who waits on whom. No sleep and
// no clock — the same pg_stat_activity busy-read the phone-lane contention test
// uses.

// bounding the test AND being the assertion — so a busy cluster produced a red
// run whose message said the lock ordering had regressed. The observed failure
// took 4.67s, right at the boundary, under a lane running 29 packages against
// one server. A flake that cries wolf about a deadlock ordering is worse than a
// plain flake: the next person either burns a day on a live bug that is not
// there, or learns to disbelieve the one message that must never be disbelieved.
//
// pg_locks is exempt from the frozen-snapshot trap that #970 fixed in this
// package's other probes: it reads the lock manager directly and is NOT the

// rather than merely a different poll, and the next author will otherwise
