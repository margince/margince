// EmailAlreadyOnFile reports whether this workspace already holds a live
// person or lead reachable at email.
//
// It is the "we know them already" probe for the paths that PROPOSE a new
// contact to a human — the site read's published-person lane is the first
// caller. Someone who has been emailing us for months arrives through the
// capture Sink as a person long before a crawler finds their name on the
// company's about page; asking a human to confirm them a second time spends
// the decision queue on work that changes nothing.
//
// Person and lead are one question here, not two. A lead is a person the
// workspace has not promoted yet (ADR-0008), so a name sitting in either
// table is a name already on file, and probing only one of them would
// re-propose everyone in the other.
//
// Both halves are row-scoped, so an out-of-scope match reads as no match and
// the caller proposes the contact anyway. That direction is the safe one: the
// answer decides what a human is shown, so a workspace-wide answer would let
// them infer which addresses exist on records their row scope hides.
//
// Which means the CALLER's principal is load-bearing. Ask this as a system
// principal on a human's behalf and the scope clauses collapse to TRUE, which
// silently restores exactly the disclosure the row scope is here to prevent —
// see the site read's probeCtx, which narrows a system worker to the
// requesting human before asking.
