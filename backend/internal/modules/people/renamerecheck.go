// The rename re-check (PO-F-2 applied to an EXISTING row).
//
// A create asks "does this company already exist?" once, with whatever it
// knows at that moment — and for a captured organization that is a name
// derived from its mail domain. The real name arrives later: a corroborated
// signature promotes it, a site dossier fills its legal name. That is the
// moment a duplicate becomes visible, and until now nothing looked. One
// workspace held a company minted as "Speedkit" from speedkit.com, renamed to
// "Baqend GmbH" by the signature sweep while "Baqend" already sat on
// baqend.com — a perfect name match nobody was watching for.
//
// So every non-human write of display_name or legal_name re-runs the fuzzy
// tier and files what it finds. It never merges (DEDUPE_FUZZY_AUTOMERGE is
// pinned never) and it never overrules the rename: the rename is right, the
// duplicate is a separate question, and the human answers it in the queue.
//
// It does run in the renaming transaction, and a fault here therefore fails
// the rename with it. That is not a preference — Postgres aborts a transaction
// on the first failed statement, so "observe without being able to fail the
// write" does not exist in-transaction; the only ways out are a savepoint
// around the detection, which trades the fault for a silently swallowed one,
// or detecting after commit, which gives up the detection-time snapshot the
// queue renders (DH-N-8). Everything this touches is a plain read, an
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING insert and an append-only log line, so a fault here
// means the transaction was already lost.
