// A caller's domain filter is reduced to the host the column stores.

// The filter narrows against `company_domain.domain`, which holds a bare
// folded host, and the operand does not: a person filtering by domain is
// pasting one out of a signature or an address bar, so the scheme, the `www.`,
// the path and the case all arrive attached. Every spelling below has to reach
// the same row, or the filter answers "no account lists this" about an account
// that lists it — a confident wrong answer, which is the one thing a narrowing
// filter must not produce.
//
// It is worth pinning HERE rather than trusting values.ParseDomain's own tests.
// Those prove the parse; this proves the filter USES it, which is the half that
// goes missing when a clause is written against the raw operand. That is not
// hypothetical for this path: the write side reduces its domains through
// parseCompanyDomains, and the two only agree because both call the same parse.
