// this ensures a person — and, unless suppressed, their company and the
// employment edge — exists for it, all through the ONE dedupe chokepoint
// (PO-F-1/PO-F-2) in one transaction (the §9 single-tx exception: person +
// organization + relationship + link are one atomic decision here).
// Exact match reuses; fuzzy CREATES ANYWAY and records a dedupe_candidate
// for the review queue (capture never blocks on a human,
// DEDUPE_FUZZY_AUTOMERGE is pinned never); no match creates.

// A connector-created row belongs to the MAILBOX OWNER until something judges
// its sender. Customer identity is shared across a workspace once somebody has
// decided the sender is a customer — before that, a mailbox with a year of
// history names a lawyer, a doctor and a school, and one email is not a reason
// to publish any of them. The verdict path ensures the same address without
// asking for owner scope, and that promotes the record. The audience of the
// correspondence itself is a separate question, decided per activity
// (platform/auth ActivityContentClause).
