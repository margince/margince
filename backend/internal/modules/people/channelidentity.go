// returning customer into a second Person the moment their next message

// updateID is Telegram's per-bot sequence number for the update that reports
// the change, and the row remembers the last one it applied. Telegram numbers
// its updates but the ingest queue runs several workers, so a block and the
// unblock answering it can arrive at this write in either order; without that
// memory the loser is applied last and a reachable customer is left suppressed
// for good, since nothing else ever writes blocked_at.
//
// The watermark advances on every update the row accepts, INCLUDING one that
// leaves the state as it found it — a newer same-state update that recorded
// nothing would leave the row still willing to accept an older update of the
// opposite state.
//
// botID scopes the comparison because update_id counts per bot: replacing the
// workspace's bot restarts the sequence low, and ids from two different bots
// do not order each other at all. IS DISTINCT FROM starts the new bot's
// sequence from scratch; comparing across bots instead would read every update
// from the replacement as stale and wedge the identity's reachability
// permanently.
//
// The write stays idempotent under Telegram's redelivery, which is the same
// update and so carries the same update_id: a repeat touches zero rows — it
// does not move blocked_at's timestamp forward, re-fire the
// updated_at/version trigger, or leave a second audit row for a state that did
// not change. Only a genuine flip is audited, which is why the pre-update
// image is read in the same statement rather than trusted from the arguments.

// auditChannelIdentityChange puts a channel-identity mutation on the PERSON's

//
// The person is the right subject, not the satellite. Both mutations this

// person read (person_children.go), and it decides whether a rep is offered
// the reply box at all — so an auditor asking "why can this person no longer
// be messaged, and since when" must find the answer on the person's history,
// exactly as a person_profile_field write is audited as a person update
// (enrichsignature.go).
//
// The bind path needs none of this: it is enclosed by the person create whose
// audit row already covers it. These two writes have no enclosing person
// mutation — they reach a Person who already exists.
//
// Every genuine change gets a row, and there is no per-identity budget on top
// of that. The counterpart decides how often they flip, so the question is what
// bounds the trail, and the answer is where the bound belongs rather than here:
//
//   - Repetition costs nothing. Both callers guard on the CURRENT stored state,
//     so a redelivered my_chat_member and a message repeating the handle we
//     already hold reach no row and write nothing — which covers everything
//     Telegram generates on its own.
//   - What is left is one row per state a human actually changed, and a human
//     who can change state can already send messages, each of which costs an
//     activity, an audit row and an event of its own. A budget here would cap a
//     constant factor on a path that is unbounded by design, and the real bound
//     on both is the same one: the workspace disconnects the bot.
//   - A capped trail would be worse than a long one. Reachability decides
//     whether a rep is offered the reply box at all, so a flip recorded nowhere
//     leaves an auditor asking "since when can we not message this person" with
//     a record that changed and a history that does not say so — and a trail
//     silently truncated by a budget reads exactly like a complete one.
