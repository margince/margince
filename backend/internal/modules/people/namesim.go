// its own job — "Acme Inc" and "Acme GmbH" ARE candidates worth showing a human
// — and the comment on fuzzyOrganization says exactly why they are not a merge:
// different legal entities are a human's call. A caller that overwrote on that
// score would perform the merge the ladder refused to, silently.

// too — case, accents, commas, and runs of whitespace — because none of those
// change which company is meant, and refusing "Acme, Inc" against "Acme Inc"
// would refuse the correction case for a typist's comma. The one difference
// between the two functions is the suffix, which is the whole point.

// names sharing a long prefix score 1.0, which is a capped score rather than a
// statement about identity. Equality here is exact over the whole string.
