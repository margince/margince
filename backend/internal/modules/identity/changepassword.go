// Possession of a LIVE SESSION is not the authority here; the current password
// is. A session is what a stolen laptop already has, and letting one set a new
// password would turn a borrowed browser into a permanent takeover. Everything
// else in this file follows from that: the verify happens before the KDF spend,
// the §27 lock binds the same way it binds login, and a wrong guess is counted
// and recorded rather than answered for free.
//
// The change itself ends every credential that existed before it and mints the
// one the caller continues on. Whoever else held a session, a grant or a token
// for this account is out; the person who just proved the current password is
// not asked for it a third time.

// ErrCurrentPasswordWrong marks a change whose current-password check failed.
// Distinct from ErrBadCredentials at the seam so the handler can answer the
// field rather than the session: the caller IS authenticated, and telling them
// "invalid email or password" would send them to the login screen they are
// already past.
