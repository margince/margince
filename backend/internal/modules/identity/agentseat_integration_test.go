// The first-party Agent Runner identity bootstrap writes (seed-and-fixtures
// §1.5) — the seat that work nobody requested answers as.
//
// What the row must NOT carry matters as much as what it must, so both halves
// are asserted: a seat that acquired a password would be a login with no person
// to administer it, and one that acquired a role would be a standing grant no
// passport ever bounded — which is precisely the ambient authority "agent ≤
// human" exists to deny. The second test holds the first of those closed
// against the one endpoint that can still open it.
