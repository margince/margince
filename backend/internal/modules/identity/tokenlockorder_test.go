// Lock ORDER between the set-password token paths, pinned at the source.
//
// Two rows are contended: the member (`app_user`) and their token
// (`auth_token`). Redemption takes the token row first and then writes the
// member. Anything that took them the other way round would let a redeem racing
// an issue each hold what the other waits for — Postgres aborts one with
// `deadlock detected`, and for the forgot-password mint it would do so
// silently, because that runs detached from the request.
//
// So the invariant is an ORDER, not the absence of a lock: whoever touches both
// must reach the token row first. That is what this file checks, by reading the
// SQL each function actually issues and comparing positions.
//
// It is a source check rather than a concurrency test: the interleaving that
// deadlocks is too narrow to hit reliably, so a race test here reports nothing
// while reading as though it proves something.
//
// The population is DERIVED from the package, and bodies resolve through calls,
// because the shape being guarded spans functions — one mints while its callee
// supersedes — and any hand-kept list omits whichever path is added next.
