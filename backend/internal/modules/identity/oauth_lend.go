// What a consent COMMITS. The screen's read model and the predicate deciding
// which passports a human may lend live next door in oauth_consent.go; this file
// is the write that ends the flow — one transaction holding the lent passport's
// row, the single-use authorization code, and the audit row naming the lend.
// Split out of oauth.go so the authorization server's request handling and the
// decision it commits stay one concept per file.

// mintLentAuthorizationCode commits one consent decision: it re-resolves the
// passport the human offered to lend, writes the single-use code the client will
// redeem, and records which passport was lent — all in ONE transaction, with the
// lent passport's row locked for its duration. It returns the plaintext courier;
// only the courier's hash is stored. The scopes it records are the ones the human
// actually lent — the lent passport's own, never the client's request.
//
// lendable is false when the passport did not survive the re-check, and then this
// transaction writes NOTHING: no code row, no audit row. Refusing is the ordinary
// outcome of a stale selection, not a failure, so it is reported as an answer
// rather than an error.
//
// The re-check runs INSIDE this transaction and takes the passport's row lock
// (lockLentPassport). That is what makes "a passport revoked in another tab is
// not lendable" hold under concurrency: a revocation racing this consent either
// commits before the lock is taken — and is then seen, so no code is written — or
// waits behind this transaction and finds the lend already recorded.
//
// The offline_access marker's durable home is oauth_grant.refresh_allowed, and
// no grant exists until the code is redeemed — so it rides in the code's
// unconstrained scopes column to survive the round trip instead of dying here.
// The exchange re-derives the boolean from it and strips it before any scope
// reaches the passport (oauth_token.go).
//
// WHERE THAT LOCK'S REACH ENDS is the code's own five minutes (authCodeTTL). A
// passport revoked after this transaction commits does not stop the code from
// being redeemed, and the redemption re-checks the human
// (requireLiveConsentingUser) and nothing else. That asymmetry is the design:
// the human's authority is what a connection borrows, while the lent passport
// contributes its scopes and then stops being party to the connection. The
// client ends up holding a NEW grant-bound passport (oauth_token.go), so
// revoking a lent passport leaves connections already derived from it working,
// and ending one goes through its grant instead (proven:
// TestALentPassportRevokedAfterConsentStillRedeems).
//
// oauth_authorization_code.lent_passport_id NAMES the lent passport (migration
// 0172), and that does not move this boundary — writing the id down is not the
// same act as consulting it. What WOULD move it is a redemption that reads the
// column to decide anything: that is a decision about what a lend means, taken
// in a WHERE clause, and the test above is what fails when someone takes it.
// The column exists so Settings can answer "which of my passports is this
// connection derived from?" without reading the audit log, and the exchange
// forwards it to the grant untouched.

// Locking the passport first would invert it, and an admin deactivating the human
// at the instant they consent would deadlock instead of one side queueing.

// It decides nothing, and the MODE is why it can afford not to. Whether the human
// is still active is judged where the grant is built
// (requireLiveConsentingUser), which takes the row FOR UPDATE; this lock exists
// only to fix an order, so it takes the weakest mode that does — the FK's own —
// and the insert below then finds it already held. FOR KEY SHARE does not
// self-conflict, so one human's two concurrent consents still run in parallel. It
// DOES queue behind the FOR UPDATE a deactivation (users.go) or a failed-login
// fold (lockout.go) holds on this row; both are short, and in the deactivation's
// case queueing is the point — the consent then re-reads a passport that cascade
// has already revoked.
