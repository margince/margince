// computed_field is read-only for every role, admin/ops included —
// RD-AC-7: no runtime formula-authoring surface exists, so there is no
// write to grant). offer_template follows the SAME posture as product/
// offer, not the pipeline-config posture: it's the offer's own branding
// input, not a locked-down schema surface, so reps create and work
// templates like any other offer-adjacent record; delete stays manager/
// admin/ops (archiveOfferTemplate carries no x-agent-access gate — any
// role holding delete may call it directly). overlay_connection follows

// connecting/disconnecting the workspace's incumbent binding is
// destructive workspace-wide config (it purges the mirror and flips
// sor_mode for everyone), so create/update/delete are admin/ops-only;
// every role may read the connection status (a rep needs to see whether
// overlay mode is live, the same as a quota's attainment read).
// embedding_reindex has no create/delete surface at all — it is a single
// deployment-level trigger, not a record kind — so only read and update
// are ever granted, and both are admin/ops-only: admin/ops may update
// (trigger a reindex; the confirm route itself carries x-agent-access:
// human-only in the contract, so this grant only ever fires from a
// human session, never an agent), and admin/ops alone may read it — the
// banner/card that consumes the read is itself ops-gated in the SPA, so
// manager/rep/read_only have no legitimate consumer of this object and
// get the zero grant, unlike quota's attainment or
// overlay_connection's status which every role legitimately reads.
// webhook_subscription follows the SAME admin/ops-owned posture: a
// subscription registers outbound egress of governed events, so managing
// the fan-out surface is workspace integration config (create/update/
// delete admin/ops-only); every role may read subscriptions and their
// delivery health. (UC-E10-04 narrates a Rep registering one; that
// posture question is tracked upstream against the spec, not settled
// here.)
// channel_connection follows overlay_connection's posture exactly: a bot
// bound at the workspace level carries every seat's inbound channel traffic,
// so create/update/delete are admin/ops-only, while every role may read the
// binding's status (a rep needs to know whether the channel is live before
// expecting a reply to arrive there).
// import_run is admin/ops-only on EVERY verb, read included: a
// migration run is a workspace-wide bulk mutation of the estate (the
// overlay→native flip executes through it), and unlike quota or
// overlay_connection there is no per-rep read surface — the mode-flip

//
// A row_scope this code cannot read is a question with no safe answer: the

// defaulting is honest. An unknown OBJECT is different — dropping it grants
// nothing, which is the strictest possible reading, and the only reading that
// cannot be exploited.
//
// Rejecting the whole document was the earlier behaviour, and it made the
// vocabulary — which is a property of the COMPILED-IN code plus whichever
// extensions this process happens to compose — a precondition for reading
// STORED DATA that outlives both. Removing an extension therefore did not
// degrade its screen: it took the whole installation's authentication down,
// because `crmauth` fails the login when any of the user's roles will not
// parse. Every user in a workspace whose role still carried
// `ext_<unit>_<object>` was locked out, with no endpoint and no migration to
// clear it — found by the Task 14 UAT, on the removal leg the tier's own
// guarantee requires an operator to perform.
//
// Data outlives the code that gave it meaning. That is not a special case for
// extensions; it is what a stored document IS.
//
// What is NOT given up: a typo'd object still grants nothing, so the
// motivating case for strictness — "a typo must not read as a bug in the role"
// — is answered by the log line rather than by refusing to authenticate. When
// a role-editing endpoint lands (`/roles` CRUD is deferred), that WRITE path is
