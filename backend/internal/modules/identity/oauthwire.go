// ADVERTISES in its metadata, and ANSWERS with. Named once, in one place,

// grant type or a parameter the endpoints do not honour strands a client after
// the human has already consented, which is the worst possible moment to fail.

	// this server. The audit trail is where that stops — it names client_id,
	// resource and scopes under its own keys (auditField*, passport.go), because
	// an audit payload is not this wire and neither vocabulary may rename the
