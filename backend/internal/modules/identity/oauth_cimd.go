// Client ID Metadata Documents (ADR-0092 §4; MCP 2026-07-28
// basic/authorization/client-registration; draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).
//
// A modern client identifies itself with an HTTPS URL that resolves to its own
// metadata document, instead of registering first and being handed an opaque
// id. It is the forward path because it needs no prior relationship at all —
// which is the ordinary MCP case — and because a client id that IS a document
// is portable across authorization servers.
//
// DCR keeps working for the compatibility window (ADR-0092 §4), so a client
// registered before this existed is not stranded by a revision it never asked
// for. Nothing below touches that path: a client_id that is not an https URL
// with a path is not a CIMD id and is resolved from the table exactly as before.
//
// THE DANGEROUS PART IS THE FETCH. An unauthenticated caller chooses a URL and
// this server dereferences it, which is textbook SSRF, so every guard below is
// load-bearing rather than defensive style. They are stated with the attack each
// one closes.

// A fragment or userinfo is refused rather than stripped. Both would make two

// mean the string this server compares is not the string the client sent.

// them and two client ids here, each with its own row and its own redirect

//
// It is hygiene, NOT the gate, and the difference matters to whoever edits this
// next: other spellings normalize on some origin servers and not here (a
// ";params" segment, a backslash, overlong UTF-8), so this can never be the
// reason a document is trusted. What makes a document speak for its own URL and
