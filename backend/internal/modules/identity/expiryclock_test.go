package identity

// Every deadline this package writes is written by ONE clock, the database's,
// derived from this package's source rather than remembered.
//
// identity holds more of these than any other package — a session's idle and
// absolute windows, a passport's, a refresh token's, an authorization code's, a
// password-reset token's, a client document's cache window — and every one of
// them is read as `expires_at > now()` INSIDE Postgres. What each decides is
// whether a credential is still good, so a deadline bound from the app process
// is not a pacing error: a process running ahead refuses a session that is
// still valid, and one running behind honours a token past its stated life.
//
// Scope is this package because it owns every table named above, pinned by
// tableownership_test.go.
