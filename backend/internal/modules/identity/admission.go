//
// Three doors, one per kind of caller — an agent presenting a passport, a human
// presenting a session, and the consent entry point that serves either. What
// they share is the order: authenticate, then apply the ceilings that hold
// whatever a role would otherwise grant (the seat tier, and an account still
// using a password its operator chose), then hand on.
