//
// A SUSPENDED SEAT IS NOT COUNTED. Suspension is how an admin stops somebody
// acting without erasing them, so counting one would bill for access the
// installation has already withdrawn.
//
// AN AGENT SEAT IS COUNTED. `app_user_agent_is_full` makes every agent a full
// seat, and a first-party runner acts on the estate exactly as a human does.
// Excluding them would let an installation act without limit through agents.
//
