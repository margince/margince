// The mutex between a consent that LENDS a passport and a revocation of that
// same passport. Both sides have to take the row lock or they overlap: Postgres
// runs them at READ COMMITTED, so a re-check reading the passport in one
// transaction while the code is written in another has a whole revocation commit
// between its two statements — and hands a client a redeemable code for a
// credential the human had already killed.
//
// Two cases, because they prove different halves and one cannot do both. The
// bounded case proves the consent CONTENDS for the row: it fails on a lock it
// would otherwise have read straight past, which is deterministic and which the
// un-locked version cannot survive. The blocking case proves the production
// OUTCOME of that contention: the consent waits, the revocation commits, and the
// re-check refuses — no error, the human's recoverable "choose again", nothing
// written.
//
// What neither reaches is the CODE's own five minutes — mintLentAuthorizationCode
// states that boundary, and oauth_lend_integration_test.go's
// TestALentPassportRevokedAfterConsentStillRedeems pins it.
