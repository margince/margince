// wrong party — the defect this exists to fix (DRAFT-AC-E-6).
//
// It resolves UserID first and OnBehalfOf second, and the order matters. An
// agent drafting through the governed tool surface is a non-human principal
// acting under a specific human's authority; OnBehalfOf is that human, and
// returning nothing there would blank the sender on exactly the path that
// inherits every drafting fix. A system principal with no human behind it
// resolves to nothing, and drafting degrades to an unsigned draft rather than
// failing.
//
// It carries NO object gate, and that is a considered position rather than an
// omission. There is no object to grant on: the question is "who is the caller"
// and the answer is the caller's own row, which they already presented
// credentials for. The workspace binding is the transaction's, so a seat in
// another tenant cannot be named however the principal was built. This is the
// same reasoning that waives SeatNames, one step narrower — that one names
// colleagues, this one names only the asker.
