//     lendable, or revoking one connection would appear to affect another.
//
// What the client asked for is deliberately NOT an exclusion. A passport grants
// its own scopes whatever was requested, so a passport that overlaps the
// request in nothing is still a valid — and possibly the intended — choice.

// it waits until the code row it would have raced has committed. Without the
// lock the two transactions pass each other and the revoked passport is lent
