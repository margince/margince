// The role grant editor (/roles, /roles/{key}/objects/{object}).
//
// Until this landed, `role.permissions` was writable by hand-written SQL and by
// nothing else. That was survivable while the vocabulary was the compiled-in
// core set — every workspace is seeded with grants on all of it — and stopped
// being survivable the moment an extension unit could register its own object
// (compose/extrbac.go). A unit's objects are registered at boot and granted by
// nobody, so the unit ships enabled and every member is refused by its own
// gate: the reference extension's screen rendering "you do not hold access to
// this extension's notes" for the installation's own admin was this gap, not a
// bug in the unit.
//
// policy.Parse's own comment named this surface as the place the strictness it
// gave up on the READ path has to be taken: an unknown object in a STORED
// document is dropped and logged, because refusing it would cost every holder
// their session, while an unknown object in a WRITE costs an admin one
// correction. setRoleObjectGrant is that write, and it refuses.
