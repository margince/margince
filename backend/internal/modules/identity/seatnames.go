// SeatNames names the colleagues in a set, as a human would recognize them.
//
// It is a WORKSPACE read and carries no row scope, because a seat is not a
// record: app_user holds no owner_id and no capture privacy, and the surfaces
// that already name colleagues — who_knows, account_coverage — name them to any
// reader in the workspace. A row-scope clause here would be inventing a rule
// this table has never had.
//
// The workspace binding is the transaction's, so a colleague of another tenant
// cannot be named however the argument was built. A seat this workspace does
// not hold is simply absent from the answer, which the caller renders as the id
// it already has.
