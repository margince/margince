// serves no SPA, so nothing here can verify that the same origin answers this
// path, and the failure lands in the middle of a human's consent. The process
// role names it at boot for exactly that reason (compose/mcpedge.go).

// reads its API base from location.origin — so naming a host here would add
// configuration that could only ever disagree with reality.

// travels alone and the server's client-facing description does not follow it.

// Both are terminal: nothing the human clicks fixes them, so the screen ends
// the flow and asks the human to start again from their client.
