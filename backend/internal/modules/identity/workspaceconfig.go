// (0211), leaving the slug bootstrap derives and columns that arrive at the
// default their migration declared and are changed later through a settings
// surface. ResetWorkspaceConfig below restores those defaults. What a data

// draws the same line: the installation itself survives the reset.

// identity and age outlive it.
//
// Name, currency and zone are absent because they are no longer columns
// (0211): they are settings rows, and platform/settings.ResetConfig spares
// them there for exactly this reason.
//
// updated_at is listed for a different reason than the rest. The reset really
// does write this row, so trg_workspace_updated moves that column, and it
// should: it records when the row was last written, which is now. It is here
// because assigning it would take it from the trigger, not because the write
// is meant to be invisible — a reset that left it untouched would report the
// row as unwritten since before the reset, which is precisely the reading that
// exposed this bug in the first place.
//
// Everything NOT listed here is configuration and is restored. That direction
// is deliberate: a column added later is restored by default rather than
// silently escaping the reset, and a column that genuinely belongs to the
// installation's identity has to be declared here to be spared.

// has no predicate beyond the id, so there is no reading under which it
