// The admin-issued set-password link (ADR-0061 Amendment 1): the provisioning
// path for an installation with no outbound-email channel, where the invite
// mail cannot be sent and self-service recovery is unavailable, so a new member
// would otherwise be created active and permanently unable to sign in.
//
// The token is the same one the invite mints — same table, same
// `password_reset` purpose, same seven-day TTL, redeemed by the same
// ResetPassword path. Only its delivery differs: the admin receives it once,
// over the response body, and hands it to the member out of band.
//
// A link can be minted for a member who ALREADY has a password, which makes
// this an account-takeover-capable operation. That is deliberate — an admin can
// already re-role and deactivate anyone, so they are the trust boundary — but
// it is why the audit row is not incidental bookkeeping here: it is the control.
