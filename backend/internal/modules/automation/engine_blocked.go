// The 'blocked' terminal outcome (A72/ADR-0035 Am.1, migration 0061): a
// workflow run that staged a 🟡 approval and then saw it rejected is a
// finished run whose effect never happened — the history must say so,
// with which approval and why. The linkage rides the run row's detail
// column (workflow_run gained no separate approval_id column): the
// Apply path stamps stagedApprovalDetail(id) (rundetail.go) when it
// parks the run, and blocking matches on that jsonb payload's
// approval_id field.

// HandleApprovalDecided is the engine-side approval.decided consumer: it turns a
// decision into the parked run's terminal outcome. A decision on a non-workflow
// approval matches no run row and is a normal no-op, so the consumer never needs
// to know which approvals are workflow stagings up front.
//
// Which outcome depends on the verdict AND the kind, because approving is not
// one thing. For a kind whose whole effect is the asking (AskingOnlyKinds —
// request_approval), the human's yes is the last thing that had to happen, so
// the run completes here. For a kind that proposes a write, the run completes
// inside the transaction its release executor performs the write in, and this
// consumer leaves it alone: completing it here would race that executor and
// report as done a write that might still fail.
//
// TWO verdicts refuse, and the second one is why the run stops waiting at all.
// A human rejecting says no; a closed window says no on nobody's behalf
// ("unactioned means rejected", APPR-PARAM-1). The expiry sweep writes that
// verdict in the same transaction as the approval and emits this event through
// the outbox, so the run is ended by the same delivery guarantee a rejection
// has — rather than by a second loop somewhere that has to be kept in step.
// Without the expired arm a staging nobody answered left its run in
// requires_approval permanently, which AUTO-AC-10 expects to see as blocked.

// It takes the CALLER's transaction, for the releases that HAVE one to lend.
