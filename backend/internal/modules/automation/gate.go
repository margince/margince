// The match-time owner-permission gate (AUTO-T06): the real security
// boundary for a human-authored automation. requireAuthorCeiling
// (ceiling.go) is a fast-fail UX check at authoring time; a firing runs
// long after that, and the author's authority can be revoked in between.
// Before a human-authored automation fires, this re-resolves the OWNER's
// live seat AND RBAC through the shared/ports/authz seam — ADR-0055's "the
// granting human's live seat/RBAC", the same two-check order admit.go runs
// for an agent principal — and refuses the firing if the owner can no
// longer perform the planned effect — never the author's stamped-at-
// authoring copy, and never a cached one.
//
// A system-seeded automation (SeedStarterAutomationsTx, automations.go)
// stamps no owner_id — there is no human authority behind it to re-check,
// so the gate skips entirely for a zero ev.OwnerID. A human-authored
// automation always carries an owner (automations.go's Create stamps
// storekit.UUIDOrNil(actor.UserID)), so the only way to reach this gate
// with a NULL owner is the trusted system-seed path.
