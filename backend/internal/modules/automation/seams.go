// errRenewalScanParamsMissing (timescan.go) already takes for an instance
// that was never configured, extended to cover an instance that WAS
// configured against a real column at save time but no longer resolves to
// one: a workspace admin can retire a custom field after an automation
// instance already names it (customfields.Retire), and save-time validation
// (validateRenewalDateFieldParam, automations_catalog_renewal.go) only
// checks non-emptiness, not live existence. Compose's adapter
// (dateFieldScanAdapter.Candidates, compose/timescan.go) maps
// customfields.ErrUnknownDateColumn onto this sentinel — the translation
// point where both the customfields error type and this seam are in scope —
// so scanDateFieldInstanceCandidates can skip the one broken instance
// without this module importing customfields to recognize its error

// apart and each still apply. Claim answers false when another firing
// already holds the row. Backed by the module's own automation_effect_claim
