// gate is the boundary that re-checks the automation's owner_id's live
// RBAC against the entity the trigger actually fired on, immediately
// before every firing applies (catalog_actions.go's Permission doc
// carries the full rationale). This check only stops a user from
// authoring an automation whose effect they plainly cannot perform by
