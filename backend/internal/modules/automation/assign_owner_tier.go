// Bulk true means the automation's own scope widened this firing past a
// single entity — e.g. a bulk reassignment run over a saved filter,
// rather than one automation instance reacting to one triggering event.
//
// No shipped automation sets Bulk today: every Action this codebase
// plans carries exactly one datasource.EntityRef in its Target (a
// single entity by construction — see ApplyActions' switch), and
// assign_lead_owner — the only live user of "assign_owner" — resolves
// its owner through people's own lead-routing SQL, never through this
// resolver or ApplyActions' ActionAssignOwner case at all. Bulk exists
// so the day a workspace author defines a genuinely bulk-scope
// reassignment automation, ApplyActions already has a resolver ready to
// hold it at 🟡 — wiring that automation's Plan to set Bulk is future
// work, not something to fabricate here.
