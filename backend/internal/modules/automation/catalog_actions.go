// principals — immediately before every firing applies. Action is the

// are 🟢, send/mass-reassign/close/archive are 🟡. request_approval is
// itself the confirm-first act, so it is 🟡 by its own nature, never
// user-set. assign_owner is "dynamic" (not a placeholder): ADR-0026 §3
// already runs this shape for advance_deal (🟢 between open stages, 🟡 to
// Won/Lost), and AUTO-T07 states the same split for reassignment —
// owner-scoped is 🟢, reassign-at-scale is the held 🟡 form. The tier
// resolves from the automation's own filter/scope at fire time
// (assign_owner_tier.go's resolveAssignOwnerTier, wired into
// ApplyActions' ActionAssignOwner case, engine.go) — no shipped
// automation's own params carry a scale signal yet, so every real
// firing today resolves single-entity; the 🟡 branch is proven against a
// synthetic scaled input by its own unit tests, never fabricated into a
// real template.
//
// RequiredPermission's Shape is proven for two actions by engine.go's
// ApplyActions switch: create_task's executor case forces entity =
// datasource.EntityActivity no matter what fired it, so it is
// PermissionPinned; assign_owner and set_field each route to
// provider.Update{Ref: action.Target} (in their own executor cases —
// applyAssignOwner and the ActionUpdateRecord arm — rather than a shared
// one), whose entity type comes from the firing event rather than this
// registry, so both are PermissionTargetScoped (verb: update) — pinning
// either to a single object would gate the wrong entity whenever the
// trigger fires on something else.
//
// The other three — notify, draft_email, request_approval —
// now have real executor cases (handlers_actions.go's applyNotify/
// applyDraftEmail; request_approval's ActionEmitFlowEvent
// still stages like every other 🟡 kind), but none names a FIXED entity
// type there the way create_task does: applyDraftEmail
// act on whatever action.Target names (a list membership target, an
// anchor thread), and applyNotify touches no entity at all. Their
// PermissionPinned classification is reasoned rather than proven by the
// switch — draft_email gates the same `activity` object create_task does
// membership; notify and request_approval land as the same "create
// something for a human to act on" shape modules/approvals/authority.go
// already grants on send_email/book_meeting/deal_follow_up — and gate.go's
// match-time gate now enforces each pin at fire time, re-checking the
// owner's live RBAC against exactly the object named here (proven for the
// reverse direction by TestRequiredPermissionForKindReverseMapIsUnambiguous,
// catalog_closure_test.go).
