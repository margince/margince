// recurringPreviewUnsupportedReason is why a recurs_yearly renewal_reminder
// instance's preview refuses rather than answering — the same
// honest-gap posture previewNotYetSupported (automations_preview.go)
// takes for the two clock handlers whose static shape can't fit either:
// this dynamic previewDef's match is a LITERAL [now, now+days_before]
// snapshot over the column's raw stored value, which for a recurring
// field (a birthday stored as, say, 1990-08-01) almost never falls
// inside any real-world window — silently answering "0 matches" would
// read as "this automation is broken" when the real answer is "preview
// cannot project a recurring occurrence yet" (DESIGN.md's own "what
// stays out of scope"). Fabricating a number here is worse than an
// honest refusal, for the identical reason previewNotYetSupported's own
// doc gives.
const recurringPreviewUnsupportedReason = "preview is not yet supported for a recurring (recurs_yearly) renewal_reminder instance: the literal snapshot preview cannot project what a yearly-recurring window would match"

// renewalPreviewParams decodes and validates the params in effect for a
// renewal_reminder preview — the draft override's if given, else the
// stored instance's own — reusing renewalDateFieldScanParams
// (timescan.go) rather than writing a third decoder for the same
// object/date_field/days_before/recurs_yearly shape (timescan.go's own
// reader, handlers_clock.go's runtime Match re-check).
//
// This validates MORE strictly than a save does:
// validateRenewalReminderParams (automations_catalog.go) only checks
// whichever keys are actually PRESENT in a save, so a stored instance can
// exist with object/date_field entirely unset — the scan's own honest
// no-op for exactly that case (scanDateFieldInstanceCandidates's doc). A
// preview must never guess a table, so here the identical condition is a
// hard refusal instead of a silent skip, and object is re-checked against
// the closed renewalReminderObjectSet even though renewalDateFieldScanParams
// itself only checks non-emptiness (a save-time Validate call may not
// have covered this exact value, e.g. a value from before the vocabulary
// was extended).
//
// It also checks date_field against the workspace's own LIVE catalog via
// catalog (AutomationStore.WithFieldCatalog, fieldcatalog.Reader — the
// same seam deals.Store/people.Store already consume, so this is not new
// cross-module plumbing): an unknown, retired, or wrong-typed column
// answers a 422 ParamError here, before renewalPreviewDef ever builds SQL
// around it, rather than reaching Postgres and surfacing as a raw 500. A
// nil catalog (the seam not wired — a test, or a role that never mounted
// it) skips this one check, the same graceful-degradation posture every
// other WithFieldCatalog consumer takes for a nil Reader.
