// Contract row visibility, which is INHERITED rather than owned.
//
// Every other row-scoped record in this system answers `owner_id`, and the
// shared row-scope helpers interpolate exactly those tables — they reject a
// table name they do not know rather than guessing, so `contract` cannot join
// them: there is no column for their clauses to test.
//
// A contract belongs to a company, not a person (ADR-0109 §8). It is visible
// when the deal it came from is visible, and — for the contracts that never ran
// through a pipeline — when its organization is visible. Deriving it rather
// than copying an owner at creation is what makes a deal reassignment carry its
// contracts in the same query, instead of leaving the agreement behind with the
// representative who no longer works the account.

// VisibleClause renders the SQL predicate that admits the contracts this
// caller may see, for a contract row under the given alias. It returns the
// empty string for an unbounded caller, exactly as the shared row-scope
// helpers do, so a caller composes it the same way.
//
// Exported because the company overview aggregates contract VALUES, and an
// aggregate that skips this predicate leaks through its total: a reader learns
// what a colleague's agreements are worth without ever being able to open one.
// One spelling, so the list and the headline cannot drift apart.
//
// Both arms require a LIVE anchor. An archived deal keeps its foreign key and
// its grants, so without the filter a contract would stay readable — and
// mutable — through a record whose own read already answers 404.
//
// That requirement is UNCONDITIONAL, and it is stated here rather than left to
// hold by accident. This used to return NO CLAUSE when both scopes came back
// empty — bundling the liveness into the narrowing, so a caller who reads every
// deal and every organization would have read contracts on archived anchors
// that the document-filing gate refuses.
//
// That caller does not exist today, and the reason is unrelated to contracts:
// `organization` is owner-private (platform/auth), so its scope clause is never
// empty and the early return was unreachable. An invariant that survives on a
// neighbouring table's privacy setting is one a change to that table quietly
// ends — so liveness is now a property of the anchor rather than of who is
// asking.
//
// The two arms are a disjunction because a contract has one anchor or the
// other: a contract WITH a deal is judged by that deal, and a contract with no
// deal is judged by its organization. A contract with a deal is deliberately
// NOT also admitted by its organization — the deal is the narrower claim, and
// widening to the company would hand a caller agreements attached to deals
// they cannot see.
