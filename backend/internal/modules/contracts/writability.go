// Contract write authority, inherited from the same anchor visibility.go
// derives sight from — and inherited in BOTH directions, which is the whole
// point of this file.
//
// A contract carries no owner_id, so every gate it has is its anchor's. The
// visibility clause answers "may this caller SEE the agreement", and until this
// file existed it was also the only thing standing in front of a patch, an
// archive, a status change, a cancellation and a renewal. A manual grant widens
// visibility at either access level (that is what makes a `read` share useful),
// so a colleague handed read on a deal could rewrite, cancel and archive every
// agreement hanging off it (#1373).
//
// The anchor rule is visibility.go's, restated once here rather than re-derived:
// a contract WITH a deal is judged by that deal, and one without is judged by
// its organization. Widening a deal-anchored contract to its company would hand
// a caller agreements attached to deals they cannot see; narrowing it to both
// would refuse a legitimate editor who holds only the deal.

// change to the agreement itself did not, so an unbounded caller could rewrite
// a contract whose deal was archived but got a 404 filing a document against
// it. One probe answers both now, rather than a second hand-composed clause.
