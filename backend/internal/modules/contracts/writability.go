// Contract write authority, inherited from the same anchor visibility.go
// derives sight from — and inherited in BOTH directions, which is the whole
// point of this file.
//
// A contract carries no owner_id, so every gate it has is its anchor's. The
// visibility clause answers "may this caller SEE the agreement", and until this
// file existed it was also the only thing standing in front of a patch, an
// archive, a status change, a cancellation and a renewal. A manual grant widens
// visibility at either access level (that is what makes a `read` share useful),
// so a colleague handed read on a deal could rewrite, cancel and archive every
// agreement hanging off it (#1373).
//
// The anchor rule is visibility.go's, restated once here rather than re-derived:
// a contract WITH a deal is judged by that deal, and one without is judged by
// its organization. Widening a deal-anchored contract to its company would hand
// a caller agreements attached to deals they cannot see; narrowing it to both
// would refuse a legitimate editor who holds only the deal.

// ensureAnchorWritable applies the write-authority probe to whichever record

//
// It asks for authority and NOT for liveness, and that is deliberate rather
// than the omission it looks like next to its siblings elsewhere. The liveness
// is already spent: writableContract reads through readContract, which composes
// VisibleClause, whose two anchor arms both carry archived_at IS NULL. A caller
// who cannot read a contract on an archived anchor cannot reach this probe at
// all, so repeating the filter here would guard nothing a human can do.
//
// The write therefore AGREES with the read rather than being stricter than it.
// Making it stricter would separate the two for a caller unbounded on BOTH
// anchors, which today is the system principal, and one question answered by
// two gates is how the next reader ends up unable to tell which is
// authoritative.
