// even when its state ranks LOWER — that is a release or a re-arm reopening the
// occurrence, and refusing it would leave the row claiming to be running when
// the source says queued. Within one attempt, rank is monotonic and settled is
// terminal. An equal (attempt, rank) redelivery matches no row and updates
// nothing, which is what makes the at-least-once bus harmless here.
//
// Every column is written from EXCLUDED rather than merged: a reopened
// occurrence must LOSE the previous attempt's finished_at, degrade_reason and
// summary, and a partial update is how a row ends up reading as live and failed
// at once.
//
// The subject is the one exception, because it is the occurrence's identity
// rather than an attempt's state: what the work is ABOUT does not change when
// the work is retried or settles. A source names it on whichever event holds
// the name, so an event that carries none keeps what an earlier one said,
// where writing it from EXCLUDED would have a settle without a label blank the
// name the rail had already shown for the run.

// and is reached by nothing afterwards — the live feed has no time bound and the
// settled purge only sees settled rows. Every interrupted call would leave one
