// inflate it further — and up to recentBound of them ship to every open tab on
// every poll. A reader needs the first paragraph, not the transcript, so the

// StateStalled is derived at READ time and never stored.
//
// Nothing writes it, so nothing can forget to: a live occurrence past the lease
// its own source declared is reported stalled, unconditionally, without a
// second query and even if every other recovery mechanism has failed. That is
// what stops a worker which died mid-run from being displayed as working.
const StateStalled = "stalled"

// feedSQL reads both halves of the feed in ONE statement, and that is what
// makes "one occurrence, one line" true rather than asserted.
//
// The transaction is READ COMMITTED — platform/database opens it with a bare
// pool.Begin and nothing sets an isolation level — so two statements would take
// two snapshots, and an occurrence that settled between them would appear in
// both: the rail would say "reading your document" and "I've read your
// document" about one reading at once. One statement is one snapshot, so the
// window does not exist to be closed.
//
// Two arms rather than one predicate, because each needs its own ordering and
// its own bound, and because each matches one of the table's partial indexes:
//
//	live     queued IS live — an occurrence waiting for a worker is work in
//	         progress to the person who asked — and ai_task_run_live indexes
//	         exactly this predicate. `stalled` is decided here, in SQL, against
//	         the DATABASE clock: stale_after was computed from timestamps the
//	         database stamped, and comparing them to a reader's host clock
//	         would answer a different question on every machine.
//
//	settled  bounded by finished_at, because "what the AI finished for me
//	         today" is a question about when it finished. An occurrence that
//	         started at 23:50 and finished at 00:10 belongs in today's feed;
//	         keyed on its start it would fall out of settled AND have already
//	         left live, so it would vanish from the rail entirely.
//	kinds    NULL means every kind, and the predicate is written so that the
//	         common case adds no work: `$7::text[] IS NULL OR kind = ANY($7)`
//	         is a constant-false-free branch the planner discards outright when
//	         the argument is NULL. It sits INSIDE each arm rather than around
//	         the union because the bound has to fall on the client's own set —
//	         filtering the result would hand back ten rows the caller draws
//	         nothing for and call the rail empty.
