// The two refusals the store makes BEFORE any SQL runs.
//
// Both shapes would be caught by the table's own CHECKs a moment later, and
// that is exactly why they are worth refusing here: a constraint violation
// arrives at the consumer as an opaque error it can only retry into forever,
// while a refusal names the field and the value. The projection is fed by an
// at-least-once bus, so "retry forever" is a wedged lane rather than one bad
// row.
