package consent

// A required body id the caller omitted must be named as a missing argument, not
// discovered as a missing row: an absent key decodes to the zero UUID with no
// error, so unguarded it reaches a lookup, matches nothing, and answers a bare
// not-found for a record the caller never mentioned.
//
// The guard is at the store entry point — the door every transport comes through —
// and it runs BEFORE any authority check or query, which is why these probes need
// no database and no actor: a store over a nil pool never reaches one.
//
// The refusal's SHAPE is proven once in platform/httperr/requirebodyid_test.go and
// asserted here through faulttest. What is left is the only question this package
// can answer: is the guard actually called for my body.
