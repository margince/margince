// The no-login preference-center transport (B-E11.32). The public
// middleware has already resolved the token to (workspace, person) and
// bound the workspace GUC plus the system principal; each handler
// re-resolves the token for the person id (the same infra read) and then
// drives the consent engine. An unknown or revoked token reads as absent
// (404) — the surface is never a consent-state oracle, and a GET/prefetch
// on the unsubscribe path never withdraws (only POST is routed to it).
