// workspaceLevelEntities are the event subject types with NO per-owner row
// scope: workspace/admin-level facts (pipeline & stage config, the
// identity/access-revocation cascade, the audit ledger, the onboarding
// wizard state, the incumbent-connection lifecycle) whose envelope is a
// bare entity ref — a receiver reads any detail back under its own scope
// (events.md §0). They deliver to any live subscription
// owner. This is an ALLOW-list, not the default: every subject type that is
// not listed here, has no explicit row-scope probe below, and is not a
// ratified deferred-delivery subject is DENIED (entityVisibleTo's
// fail-closed default), so a newly-subscribable row-scoped subject can
// never silently inherit fan-out-to-everyone (BYO-EVT-4). Adding a
// subscribable event whose subject is row-scoped means adding a probe
// below; one that is genuinely ownerless means adding it here; one whose
// subject cannot yet be scope-resolved means ratifying it in a
// deferred-delivery exception — the choice is forced, never defaulted.
//
// The keys are the RUNTIME entity-type strings the emit sites stamp (the
// storekit.EmitEvent EntityType() / EmitEventForEntity caller argument),
// which are NOT the dotted event prefix: role.changed and the user.*
// lifecycle both name entity "user"; passport.revoked names "passport";
// onboarding.state_changed names "onboarding_wizard_state";
// incumbent.connected/disconnected name "incumbent_connection". The
// approval.*/coldstart.* events name entity "approval" but are NOT listed
// here — an approval's envelope carries staged-change detail (summary,
// edited_change, target ids) that a bare-ref allow-list would fan out to
// owners who cannot see the target, so "approval" is instead gated by
// approvalVisibleTo in the switch below (BYO-EVT-4). The mirror.* events
// name a dynamic object_class, handled by deferredDeliveryEvents below, so
// no "mirror" key exists either.
// selfOnlyEvents are subscribable events whose subject is a member's OWN
// account and whose payload no other seat may read — not even an admin.
//
// They are keyed by EVENT TYPE rather than entity type because they stamp
// entity "user", which they share with role.changed and the user.* lifecycle.
// Those are genuinely workspace-level facts carried as a bare ref, so "user"
// sits in workspaceLevelEntities below and delivers to every live subscription
// owner. These do not qualify twice over: their subject is self-only by
// decision (ADR-0078 §8b — a colleague's professional network is theirs, and
// the API has no path to another member's row), and their payload carries
// state rather than a bare ref, so the "receiver re-reads it under its own
// scope" justification does not apply.
