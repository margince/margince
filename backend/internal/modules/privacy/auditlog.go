// of an administrative act performed on that activity, and withholding one
// destroys governance data rather than protecting anything: the row recording
// "this conversation was limited to its participants, naming 3 members" carries
// nothing a reader outside the audience is not entitled to, and is precisely
// what a compliance reader is looking for.
//
// The map is an ALLOWLIST and the redaction is fail-closed: a key that is not
// here is dropped, so a new writer that starts recording content into an audit
// image cannot leak it by default.
//
// ⚠️ SCOPE, narrower than "the audience is honoured on this endpoint": this map
// is consulted only for an audit row whose entity_type is `activity`. Other
// entity types that hang off an activity — `attachment`, whose image carries
// the user-supplied filename, plus `attachment_extraction`, `transcript_read`
// and `scheduled_send` — are not joined to their activity and are not
// redacted, so a reader outside the audience receives those images whole.
//
// Each entry carries a predicate on the VALUE, because a key alone is not a
// safety property. `body` is the case that forced it: the writer reduces it to a
// presence flag and says so in a comment, but nothing bound the READER to that —
// one plausible edit turning `delta["body"] = true` into the body itself would
// have handed an out-of-audience admin the confidential text of a limited
// conversation through this endpoint, passing every gate in the tree.
//
// `body` is the only entry actually constrained. The rest are anyValue, so the
// "a writer starts nesting content under this key" scenario applies unchanged
// to `kind`, `source_system` or a timestamp: those are judged safe by what the
// activity read surface answers for them, which is a claim about today's
// writers rather than a guard. Tightening one is a one-line predicate.
