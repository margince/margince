// The controller's two decisions about what a statutory obligation holds
// (A165/ADR-0114 §4). The classification is a proxy for a legal judgement that
// belongs to the controller under Art. 5(2), and a product that makes that
// judgement unappealable makes its customer unable to comply — so an
// administrator holding the retention authority may RELEASE a record the
// derivation held wrongly, or PIN one it missed.
//
// Neither is a toggle. Both require a stated reason, both are audited, and
// both are attributed to the person who decided: DEPACK-AC-5a forbids a
// SILENT override, which a logged decision by a named accountable person is
// the opposite of.
