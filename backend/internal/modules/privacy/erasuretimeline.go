// The three id sets come from the same fragments the destroy and the hold
// select from, so a row cannot be judged by one spelling and locked by another.
// Only the NUMBERING is adapted: the fragments are written for the destroy's
// argument list, where the channel keys are $6 behind the floor and the
// tombstone name, and this statement wants none of those. Renumbering one
// placeholder is the smallest adaptation that keeps one definition of the row
// set; TestTheTimelineLockBindsEveryPlaceholderItNames holds it to three.

// The judgement is erase-or-hold, and it reads `retention_class` — which a deal

// (activities.StampCorrespondenceForDeal). Without this lock the two can
// interleave: the erasure reads a NULL class, destroys the correspondence, and
// the qualification commits afterwards. The row is gone either way, so nothing
// readable survives — but A165/ADR-0114 §1 says that correspondence was to be
// HELD, and the obligation was not honoured (issue #1618).
//
// The lock is what makes the race have a winner. Under READ COMMITTED a
// qualification already holding these rows makes this statement wait, and the
// erasure then re-reads the class it just waited for — so an in-flight
// qualification wins and its correspondence is held. One that starts after this
// lock waits for the commit and stamps a row already erased, which is the
// residual and is the honest one: by then there was nothing to hold.
//
// NO FLOOR PREDICATE, deliberately. The floor is what the judgement uses to
// decide, and a lock that pre-applied it would leave exactly the rows whose
// class is about to change unlocked — the ones this exists for.
