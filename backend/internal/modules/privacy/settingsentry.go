// The privacy module's settings declarations (ADR-0090/A135). Privacy supplies
// the type, default, validator, RBAC object and audit verb; platform/settings
// runs them without knowing what retention is.

// retentionPolicyObject is the RBAC object gating the whole retention surface —
// the policy rows AND this posture. Admin/ops-only on every verb, read
// included: whoever may author a rule about what the installation destroys is
// also who may suspend every such rule, and no other role has a consumer for
// either read.
const retentionPolicyObject = "retention_policy"

// RetainOnly is the installation's retain-only posture (GCS-PARAM-6): while it
// holds, the nightly evaluator applies no `anonymize` and no `erase`, whatever
// any policy row says. `archive` is untouched, because archiving retains.
//
// It is a POSTURE rather than an edit to the policy rows, and that is the whole
// design. An installation under a contractual keep-everything obligation keeps
// its ladder visible and intact — an admin can see exactly what would happen if
// the obligation lapsed — and lifting the posture resumes enforcement with
// nothing to re-author. Editing the rows away would have destroyed that
// information to express the same intent.
//
// Default FALSE, deliberately. Storage limitation (Art. 5(1)(e)) is what
// "compliant out of the box" means for the seeded ladder (DM-SEED-1..6), so the
// regulated installation opts IN rather than every installation opting out. A
// deployment that must never delete says so before first boot instead
// (`seeds.retention.default_policy: retain_only`, GCS-PARAM-7), which closes the
// window between seeding the rows and the first admin login.
//
// No validator: both values are legitimate postures, and one here would be
// ceremony. No freeze probe: a posture that could stop being changeable would
// be a trap — the obligation that justified it can lapse.
