// The activity-selection SQL the Art. 17 person-erase cascade walks: which
// timeline rows are the subject's alone, which of those a person-erase may
// actually destroy (the statutory floor shields the rest), and the unlinked
// mail — captured and sent alike — the link-walk cannot see. Kept in one file
// so the selectors read as one concept.

// notTransitivelyHeld excludes an activity frozen by a legal hold reached
// through its own links — the same transitive freeze the retention engine
// applies (retention.go: "a hold on the subject must cover the evidence about
// them"). Without it, an activity that is erasable to this cascade yet
// transitively held to retention gets destroyed here, spoliating
// litigation-held evidence the nightly evaluator explicitly refuses to touch.
//
// It is a function rather than a copied fragment because EVERY selector this
// file feeds into the erase UPDATE owes the exclusion, and the selectors alias
// the activity differently. A selector that could be written without it would
// re-admit exactly what its sibling just excluded, so the only way to write one
// is to name its activity expression here.
//
// Every OTHER linkable record that carries a legal_hold column has an arm
// here — TestEveryLegalHoldColumnIsReadByEveryActivityHoldSelector derives
// that set from the committed schema, so the next table to gain the column
// fails the test until its arm exists.
//
// The held-person arm is deliberately absent: a person-linked activity shared
// with another subject is already outside every selector below, and the erased
// subject itself is proven unheld before the cascade runs (ErasePerson's
// own-hold check).

// unlinkedSubjectMail selects mail that is ABOUT the subject by address and
// linked to no OTHER person — the class the link-walk above cannot see, under
// the same exclusion it uses.
//
// It exists because ADR-0072 stopped creating a counterparty for every captured
// message. Under ADR-0063 every mail ensured a person, so a link always
// existed and walking links covered everything; a deferred, noise-dispositioned
// or still-unsure sender now produces activities with no link at all. Erasure
// that only walks links would leave that mail — the address, the subject line
// and the body — sitting in the timeline after the subject exercised Art. 17.
//
// It reaches mail in BOTH directions, and the symmetry is the point. Outbound
// mail this installation SENT reaches the subject the same way: the send path
// gives its activity only the links the anchor already had, so a reply anchored
// on an organization- or deal-linked thread — or on one with no person link at
// all — records the recipient's address and the whole message body while being
// linked to nobody. A direction test would have left exactly the mail we wrote
// to the subject behind, along with the delivery row behind it.
//
// counterparty_email is what makes this selector safe to state that broadly:
// only two paths ever write it — the capture sink and the send path — so a
// non-null value already means "this activity is a message", and no manually
// logged call or note can be caught by it.
//
// It does not, however, name everyone a message reached. A send stores only
// the FIRST addressee in counterparty_email while comms_outbound keeps the
// whole `recipients` and `cc` lists, so a subject who was a second recipient
// or a Cc is invisible to the activity column alone — and their address, the
// subject line and the body would survive the erase in the delivery row. The
// delivery arm below closes that: the address lists are unnested and matched
// exactly as the Art. 15 assembly matches them (sar.go), because both answer
// the same question about the same two columns and two spellings of it would
// drift apart. The existence of a comms_outbound row is itself proof the
// activity is a message, so the arm is at least as narrow as the column one.
//
// Widening what SELECTS the ids — rather than reaching deliveries by address
// directly — is what keeps both exclusions binding on the new arm: the ids
// still flow through the shared legal-hold expression below and through the
// correspondence floor the caller applies, so a delivery can never be scrubbed
// while the activity it belongs to is shielded.
//
// Mail also linked to someone else belongs to that person's record too, and
// redacting it would erase a different subject's history.
// $1 is the person; $2 the subject's addresses, already lowercased by the
// person_email normalization CHECK. The `m` alias keeps this
// selector distinct from the `a`-aliased activity the correspondence floor
// filters when redactSubjectTimeline wraps both id sets in one UPDATE — so
// commercial correspondence younger than the statutory floor is shielded here
// exactly as it is on the link-walk arm.
//
// The legal-hold exclusion matters MORE on this arm than on the link-walk one:
// a send inherits its anchor's organization and deal links, so mail on a held
// deal's thread is the ordinary shape of an activity with no person link at
// all — precisely the position a litigation hold protects.
// unlinkedSubjectChannel is the channel twin of unlinkedSubjectMail, and it
// exists for a sharper reason than symmetry: a channel activity's person link is
// written by a SEPARATE transaction after the capture commits, so an erasure
// landing in that gap leaves an activity linked to nobody.
//
// The mail arm rescues only some of those. It keys on counterparty_email, and a
// channel activity carries one only when its provider knew the sender's address
// AND that source vouched for it — never for a transport where the bot holds no
// address for the sender, which is every core channel connector. So for those
// the two facts still compose: reachable by neither selector, permanently, since
// the suppression row then guarantees the identity is never recreated and no
// later erasure, subject-access or retention pass can find it. This arm is what
// closes that, for the addressless transports and inside the pre-link window
// alike.
//
// It matches on thread_key rather than a link, because thread_key IS the
// account: the capture writes `provider:botID:accountID`, so the third segment
// is the subject's own account id. Pairing it with source_system in one
// composite key ($N holds `provider:account` strings) is what keeps the match
// exact — a bare account-id comparison would be a numeric string match across
// every provider, which is precisely the over-deletion this module refuses
// elsewhere (an untyped id match is why ai_call_payload has no channel arm).
//
// The same NOT EXISTS exclusion as the mail arm applies: a row shared with
// another person stays, because redacting it would erase a different subject's
// record.
