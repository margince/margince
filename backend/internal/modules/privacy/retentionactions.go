// Split from retention.go because the table is two things at once — the dispatch
// AND the authorable set — and both the nightly pass and the write path consult
// it. Keeping it beside the pass made it read as an implementation detail of the
// loop, which is exactly the reading that let scope and action be validated
// independently.
