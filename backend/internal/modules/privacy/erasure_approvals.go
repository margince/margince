// A staged approval holds a frozen proposal — for a held draft that is
// an addressee and the whole body of a message written to somebody — and a
// workflow run holds what its automation planned and produced. Neither is
// reachable by the rest of this package: every other outbound scrub keys off
// the activity a message became, and a message waiting in an inbox has none.
//
// It is the same gap scheduledsends.go closes for the timer, one step earlier
// in the message's life, and it fails the same way. Left alone, a subject who
// exercises Art. 17 tonight has their draft released by a colleague at nine
// tomorrow, from a system that has just certified their data destroyed. The
// rows nobody ever decides are worse: an approval that expires and a run that
// blocks both keep their payloads forever, with nothing that would look at them
// again.
//
// Kept in its own file for the reason scheduledsends.go is: it belongs to
// neither destructive engine, and both reach it.

// subjectApprovalMatch is the WHERE clause naming every staging that holds the
// subject, shared by the scrubs below and by the Art. 15 export so they cannot
// disagree about which rows are the subject's. A row that erasure destroys and
// the export never lists is a subject given two different answers about what is
// held about them.
//
// Three ways a proposal names somebody, because there are three ways one is
// written. It may be ABOUT them — the staging's target is their person record,
// or the LEAD row that is the same human before promotion — or it may merely
// CONTAIN them, which is how a held draft carries an addressee and a body: the
// payload is per-kind JSON this package cannot parse, so it is matched as text.
//
// The lead arm is not decoration. A staging targeting the subject's lead twin
// carries their name and phone and frequently no email string at all, so the
// text arm never sees it and the person arm names the wrong row — the sibling
// copy of the case under review, which is the recurring miss this codebase has
// a rule about.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT match is EVIDENCE, and that asymmetry is the
// point rather than an omission. Evidence quotes a source record verbatim, so
// the erasure's entitlement to destroy a quotation is exactly its entitlement
// to destroy what was quoted — which redactApprovalsCitingActivities decides by
// CITATION, from the ids the timeline scrub actually redacted, already filtered
// for legal hold and the statutory floor. Matching the quoted TEXT here would
// add precisely the rows those filters excluded: a proposal read out of a
// held, floor-shielded or shared meeting, destroyed on an erasure that leaves
// the meeting itself standing — another subject's live work gone, spoliating
// held evidence, and the address still readable in the source it was read from.
// The export widens onto evidence instead (sarmessages.go), where
// over-inclusion is admin-mediated and recoverable and over-destruction is not.

// addressPatterns turns the subject's addresses into regexes that match each

// Escaping the address is not enough, and this is the trap: a neutralised

// valid address and a suffix of `tim@acme.com`, so erasing the first would blank
// and withdraw every staged message written to the second — a third party's
// live work destroyed by a request that was never about them — and would hand
// that third party's whole message body to the wrong subject in an Art. 15
// export. Neither is recoverable the way an over-broad deletion of captured

// `_` and `%` are ordinary characters to a regex, and QuoteMeta neutralises
// every regex metacharacter an address could carry.

// fills evidence, the run teardown belongs here too, keyed off the ids expired
