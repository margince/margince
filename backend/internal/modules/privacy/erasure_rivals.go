// The precondition Art. 17 erasure runs before it destroys anything: no OTHER
// live Person may still hold one of this subject's identifiers.
//
// Both satellites that identify a human — person_email and
// person_channel_identity — carry a unique index that is PARTIAL on
// archived_at IS NULL, and archiving a Person archives its satellites
// (people/person.go). So the pair (archive the record, let the human write
// again) legitimately produces a SECOND Person holding the same address or the
// same channel account, with a live binding. Erasure resolves the subject by
// person_id, which is the right scope for the record but the wrong scope for
// the identifier: it arms the suppression list and purges the raw evidence for
// the ACCOUNT while anonymizing only ONE of the records that account reaches.
// What is left behind is the worst of both — the duplicate still names the
// human, still reads as reachable, and a rep can message them; while that
// duplicate's own evidence was destroyed by an erasure that was never about it.
//
// So the erasure refuses instead. The alternative — cascading into the rival
// Person — would make one Art. 17 request anonymize records it never named,
// which is unbounded in exactly the direction erasure must not be. A refusal
// leaves the installation intact and tells the operator the one thing that
// makes the request satisfiable: merge the duplicates, then erase the survivor.
//
// The rival must be a LIVE Person. An archived duplicate holds no live binding
// and is reachable by nobody; its stale identifier rows are removed by the
// account-scoped deletes in eraseChannelIdentities and anonymizeSubjectRows,
// which is why refusing on those too would deadlock — with no live record to
// merge into, there would be no order in which either could ever be erased.
