// skipped, loudly, every pass forever, so storing one would report governance
// the installation does not have.

// The engine keys its selectors by `object_type + "/" + category`, with the
// empty category leaving a bare trailing slash ("activity/"). The wire spells
// the same pair without it ("activity"), because a trailing slash on a wire
// enum reads as a typo. This file owns that translation so neither side has to
// know the other's spelling.
