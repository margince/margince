// The channel half of Art. 17 erasure. A person's channel identities — the
// provider account id behind their messages and the @username it carries —
// identify the subject as directly as an address does, and the id is the key a
// re-capture would resurrect them by. So the same three steps the address half
// runs apply here, in the same order and for the same reason: collect the
// identifiers, delete the rows, then arm the suppression list, because once the
// rows are gone nothing holds the identifiers to hash.
//
// It lives beside erasure.go rather than inside it so the cascade file stays
// under the file-length cap; erasureCascadeFiles in the PII-coverage gate lists
// both, so extracting a scrub here does not take it out of that gate's sight.

// purgeChannelRawCapture reaches raw_capture by channel identity, the
// counterpart to purgeDerivedTraces' email lane (erasure.go): a Telegram-only
// Person carries no email at all, so that lane never runs for them, and
// without this one their raw captures — the verbatim update JSON, including
// display name, username, numeric id and full message text — would survive
// Art. 17 erasure forever.
//
// The match is a typed JSONB path equality, never ILIKE. A Telegram sender id
// is a bare 9-10 digit integer; a substring search for it would also match
// against message ids, timestamps and other subjects' ids anywhere in ANY
// provider's payload, in the whole workspace's raw_capture table — an
// over-deleting erasure (another subject's evidence gone) is far worse than an
// under-deleting one, which is the entire reason the email lane beside this
// one accepts ILIKE at all: an email address is specific enough that the
// same risk does not apply to it.
//
// Both payload shapes below are matched because both land in raw_capture
// under the SAME source_system: capture/telegram's Normalize reads the sender
// from message.from.id for an ordinary message, and ParseMembership reads it
// from my_chat_member.chat.id for a block/unblock report — the poller persists
// the raw update before the ingest worker classifies which kind it is, so an
// unerased row of either shape would
// still resolve back onto this subject's account.
//
// The membership arm reads the CHAT and not new_chat_member.user, which is
// the bot: my_chat_member reports a change to the bot's own membership
// (capture/telegram/membership.go), so that user id belongs to no Person and
// an erasure keyed on it would purge nothing while appearing to cover the
// shape. A private chat's id IS the customer's own user id, which is exactly
// what person_channel_identity stores.
//
// ai_call_payload (erasure.go's purgeDerivedTraces) gets no equivalent lane:
// 0089's schema gives it no structural link to a subject at all, so the only
// possible match there would be a substring search for the same bare numeric
// id across every AI call in the workspace, not one provider's captures —
// strictly the over-deletion risk this function exists to avoid, only wider.
// purgeChannelCaptureTrace deletes the subject's rows from the 24-hour capture
// trace for a counterparty the pipeline knew by a provider ACCOUNT rather than
// by an address.
//
// The email lane in erasuretimeline.go cannot reach these. It matches
// `counterparty` against an address, and a channel trace writes the person's
// DISPLAY NAME into that column instead (capture/trace.go, traceChannelPayload)
// — so a subject who only ever wrote from Telegram had every trace row survive
// an erasure that reported success.
//
// This was invisible while capture.trace_payloads defaulted off, because the
// column it leaves behind was never written. Turning the default on is what
// made a dormant gap a live one.
//
// Matched on the NAME and scoped to the provider, because the trace stores no
// account id: `source_system` is the provider and `counterparty` is the name,
// and there is no third column to join on. Crude for the same reason the lanes
// around it are crude — over-deleting a diagnostic row that expires within the
// day is recoverable, under-deleting personal data is not — and bounded by the
// provider so an erasure cannot reach a same-named person on another transport.
//
// A subject with no name and no channel identity matches nothing, which is the
// correct amount of work: there is no column left that could name them.
// subjectDisplayName reads the name the channel trace wrote, BEFORE the
// cascade's anonymize step replaces it with a placeholder.
//
// Gathered at the top of ErasePerson beside the subject's emails and channel
// identities, for exactly the reason those are: every purge below that line
// matches on an identifier, and an identifier read after it has been wiped
// matches nothing while the rows it was meant to reach stay named.
