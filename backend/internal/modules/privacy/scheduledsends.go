package privacy

// The messages nobody has sent yet. A scheduled send (ADR-0104) holds a frozen
// payload — the addresses, the subject and the body — before any activity
// exists, which is exactly why the rest of this package cannot reach it: every
// other outbound scrub keys off the activity the message became, and a message
// that has not fired has none.
//
// Left alone, a subject who exercises Art. 17 the night before a scheduled send
// gets the message anyway, at nine the next morning, from a system that has
// just certified their data destroyed. Cancelled and held rows are worse: they
// have no timer at all, so their copy of the address and the body would sit
// there indefinitely with nothing that would ever look at them again.
//
// Kept in its own file for the reason deliveries.go is: both destructive
// engines call it, and it belongs to neither.

// redactScheduledSends empties every scheduled message addressed to one of the
// subject's addresses, and stops the ones that have not fired.
//
// It selects on ADDRESSES rather than on activities, which is the opposite of
// redactDeliveries and forced by the shape of the thing: a scheduled send has
// no activity to inherit a decision from. That means it also inherits none of
// the activity engine's shields — but there is nothing for them to protect
// here. The statutory correspondence floor exists to keep SENT business
// letters; a message nobody has sent is not correspondence yet, and a
// Handelsbrief that was never sent is not one.
//
// Pending rows are CANCELLED rather than merely emptied. A scheduled row whose
// payload is blank still has a live timer, and the fire path would replay an
// empty message to an empty address list — a send that fails confusingly at
// best, and at worst one the gates cannot refuse because there is no longer
// anyone named to refuse on behalf of. Cancelling is what makes the timer a
// no-op, and it is terminal to every other transition.
//
// Released rows are emptied but keep their status: the message was sent, the
// activity and the delivery record that fact, and both are scrubbed by the
// engines that own them. Rewriting the status here would falsify what happened.
//
// No reason is written anywhere. A cancelled row carries none by design (the
// state-shape CHECK reserves held_reason for holds), and the delivery scrub's
// park reason has no analogue here: nothing was handed to a provider, so there
// is no operator waiting to be told why a transmission stopped.
