// a separate file, not a separate obligation, and reached only from
// anonymizeSubjectRows. erasureCascadeFiles in the PII-coverage gate lists this

// Every clause here reaches the subject by IDENTIFIER as well as by person id,

// LinkedIn ghost both ARE. A person-keyed sweep alone leaves the subject
// named, reachable and re-matchable.
