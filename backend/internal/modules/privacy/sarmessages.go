		// send whose activity was never linked to their record still went to
		// their address, and one addressed to a third party but filed on their
		// timeline is still a message about them.
		//
		// The two arms err in OPPOSITE directions and both are deliberate.
		// Reaching by address alone would miss the timeline; reaching by link
		// alone would miss the unlinked send.
		//
		// The PROJECTION is deliberate too: recipients and cc are returned
		// whole, so a message the subject shared with other people hands the
		// export those people's addresses as well — whichever arm matched the
		// row. Narrowing the arrays to the subject's own address would be the
		// safer default in a self-serve export, and it is rejected here for two
		// reasons. An address list is part of what the message WAS, and Art. 15
		// owes the subject the data held about them rather than a redraft of
		// it. And this assembly is admin-mediated (AssembleSAR demands the
		// person.delete grant and an unbounded scope, above), so the disclosure
		// is a human handing a package to a subject, not an endpoint answering
		// one — the same posture, and the same tolerated over-inclusion, as the
		// Activities and Attachments sections, whose free text and filenames
		// name third parties for exactly the same reason. It is what separates
		// this from the erasure cascade, which must refuse the equivalent
		// reach: a disclosure to an admin-mediated export is recoverable, and
		// destroying another subject's evidence is not.
		//
		// It spans BOTH shapes the row admits (comms_outbound_shape, 0155): a
		// channel delivery leaves subject/recipients/cc null and names its
		// addressee in channel_user_id, so a mail-only projection would hand a
		// channel-only subject a message with no addressee — withholding the
		// account id the row holds about them.
		// html_body rides beside body rather than instead of it: a message
		// carrying both is ONE message the subject received in two renderings,
		// and disclosing only the plain one withholds markup the system still
		// holds about them. from_name joins them for the same reason: this
		// projection discloses the message AS THE SUBJECT RECEIVED IT, and who
		// it appeared to be from is part of what they were shown.
		//
		// The address match spans bcc, and the DISCLOSURE of it is narrowed to
		// the subject's own address.
		//
		// Both halves are required and they pull opposite ways. A person bcc'd
		// on a message with no activity link would otherwise be absent from
		// their own export of a message they received — and exporting the
		// whole bcc array would hand one subject every other blind recipient's
		// address, which is the disclosure a blind copy exists to prevent. So
		// the row is FOUND on any addressee and the blind list is REDUCED to
		// the asker. bounce_recipient follows the same rule: it names ONE
		// addressee, so it is disclosed only when that addressee is the asker.
		//
		// attachments too, and it is not covered by the attachment query
		// below: that one finds files hanging off the subject or an activity
		// linked to them, while a send may carry any file its sender could see
		// — one attached to an organization or a deal reaches the subject
		// without ever being attached TO them.

		// does not parse. The looseness errs toward including a proposal that

		// export — Art. 15 owes them what is held, and a staged message naming
		// them is held about them whatever kind wrote it.
		//
		// Loose about SHAPE is not loose about WHO, and this is the half that
		// bites: an address dropped into a substring match hands a THIRD PARTY's
		// composed message to whoever asked. subjectApprovalMatch anchors it,
		// and the export shares that predicate with the erasure so a subject
		// cannot be told two different things about which rows are theirs.
		//
		// The export then reaches PAST it, onto the quotations, and the
		// containment runs one way ON PURPOSE: everything the erasure destroys
		// is listed here, and the export lists more besides. A row this reaches
		// and the cascade leaves alone is a proposal read out of a record the
		// cascade is not entitled to destroy — held, floor-shielded, or shared
		// with somebody else — and the subject is owed sight of it either way.
		// The reverse containment is the one that must never hold: a row
		// destroyed and never listed tells a subject nothing was staged about
		// them and then destroys it on the strength of the same reading.
		//
		// The proposal is returned whole, for the same reason the sent
		// messages' recipient lists are: this assembly is admin-mediated, so
		// the disclosure is a human handing a package to a subject rather than
		// an endpoint answering one.
		//
		// Evidence rides along because it is the part of a staging held in the
		// subject's OWN words — the verbatim lines a claim was read out of, a
		// sentence they spoke in a meeting. The proposal is what this
		// installation concluded; the evidence is what it kept of them in order
		// to conclude it, which is the half an Art. 15 answer would be strangest
		// to omit.
		//
		// It is the one column here that is NARROWED rather than returned whole,
		// and the bcc lists above are narrowed for the same reason. Everything
		// else on this row is text this installation COMPOSED — a summary, a
		// proposal — and the loose arms match on exactly that. Evidence is not
		// composed: it is a raw line lifted out of some record, so a row matched
		// because a summary mentions the subject's address would otherwise hand
		// them a verbatim sentence out of a meeting they were never part of,
		// about people they have no relationship to. So the ROW is found by any
		// arm, and the QUOTATIONS are reduced to the ones that are the subject's
		// to see: read out of a record they are linked to, or naming them
		// outright. The rest belongs to another record.
		//
		// Per ITEM, not per row, because evidence is per-claim: a proposal
		// asserting two things cites two sources, and only one of them may be
