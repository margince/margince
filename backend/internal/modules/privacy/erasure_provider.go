// The two halves are treated differently on purpose. A CLAIM is the value

// nobody may now assert anything about — it goes. A RUN is what the

// nobody it is an accounting fact about the installation, not the subject's
// data (PI-AC-8), and that is what keeps a spend history stable across an
// erasure.

// the one named. An ARCHIVED duplicate legitimately holds the same human's
// address (uq_person_email_dedupe is partial on archived_at IS NULL), and
// with it their purchased email, mobile number and job history — plus a
// provider_job_id that would let the provider be re-asked for exactly the
// answer this erasure destroyed. A live duplicate never reaches here:
// refuseRivalIdentifierHolders refuses the erasure outright.
