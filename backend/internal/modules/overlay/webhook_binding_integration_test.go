// The webhook-as-signal tenant binding's real-Postgres proof (OVA-DDL-3 /
// OVA-WIRE-10 / AC-OV-13 a–b): Connect records the incumbent portal id, and
// WorkspaceForPortal resolves ONLY the workspace whose active connection
// carries that portal — an unbound portal is ErrNotFound (fail-closed, no
// cross-tenant), which is what makes the receiver refuse it.

// The ambiguity case has no test any more, and cannot: it connected TWO
// workspaces carrying one portal id and asserted the binding refused both
// rather than picking one. `incumbent_connection` is a singleton since
// ADR-0091 §8 phase B — one connection per installation, enforced by the index
// — so a second one cannot be created to make a portal ambiguous.
//
// WorkspaceForPortal keeps its fail-closed branch. It is unreachable through
// the schema now, which is the same posture the retirement migration's own
// pre-flight takes: a guard whose condition the schema forbids is cheap, and
// "unreachable" is not a reason to answer a webhook by guessing.
