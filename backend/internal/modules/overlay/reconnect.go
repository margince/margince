// This file owns Connect's reconnect branch (connection.go's Connect calls
// into it when existingConnectionStatus finds a revoked row): reviving the
// workspace's revoked incumbent_connection row rather than inserting a new
// one, and the pre-flight read that tells Connect which of the two branches
// applies. Split out of connection.go (which keeps the fresh-insert path,
// Get, and the shared cleanupOrphanedRef both branches call) purely to stay
// under the file-length cap — a mechanical relocation of the
// reconnect-specific symbols, with no change to their logic. The write
// shape once the row itself is revived — Audit + Emit + the workspace mode
// flip, identical to what a fresh insert needs — is activateConnection
// (activation.go), not duplicated here.
