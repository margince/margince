// ingestSQL is the in-SQL cache-refresh upsert design.md §4.4/§4.9

// serialize on Postgres's row lock instead of racing an app-level
// read-compare-write:
//
//   - tombstone-guard (WHERE NOT EXISTS …): an erased external_id is
//     never re-created — the sweep that would otherwise resurrect it
//     never gets the chance to see the row at all.
//   - staleness (ON CONFLICT … WHERE excluded.updated_at_baseline > …):
//     an older incumbent read can never clobber a newer one, so ingest is
//     safe to call with a stale poller page racing a fresher read of the
//     same record. A re-projection is admitted at the SAME baseline only:
//     the incumbent has not touched the record, so its baseline does not
//     advance, but the same record under a changed declaration is not an
//     older read — refusing it would strand the row holding a payload the
//     current mapping would never produce. An OLDER read stays refused
//     whatever its fingerprint says, because a stale page carries a stale
//     projection too, and admitting it on a fingerprint difference would
//     let the sweep's own laggard pages overwrite fresher rows — which a
//     declaration change makes likely, since it puts every row's
//     fingerprint out of date at once. The comparison is IS DISTINCT FROM,
//     so a row recording no declaration (NULL — mirrored before the column
//     existed) compares as different rather than as unknown, which would
//     refuse exactly the rows nothing has verified.
//     A landed row also clears reprojection_failed_for (the declaration a
//     re-projection could not reach, projectionstaleness.go): a row that lands
//     a projection is not failing to reach one, and the ingest that landed it
//     is the single writer of that fact — clearing it anywhere else would put
//     two writers on one column and leave a row marked failing against a
//     declaration it is already holding.
//   - no-clobber-dirty (… AND sync_state <> 'pending_sync'): a row with
//     an un-drained local write (branch 2) is not blindly overwritten by
//     an inbound incumbent change; it is held for the conflict path
//     (mirror.conflict, not implemented until branch 2's write path
//     lands — see the ProjectOwnerVisibility seam note in Ingest below).
