// This file owns the incumbent connection lifecycle (design.md §4.3):
// Connect/Get over incumbent_connection. Connect is a genuine
// system-of-record mutation — a workspace choosing its incumbent binding
// — so it carries the full write shape (storekit.Audit + storekit.Emit
// in the same transaction as the domain row), unlike mirror ingest
// (mirrorstore.go), which is a derived-cache refresh with no audit
// trail. Disconnect's teardown/purge/scrub lives in teardown.go — this
// file only flips the connection row and the workspace mode columns on
// the way in. Connect's OTHER branch — reviving a revoked row instead of
// inserting a fresh one — lives in reconnect.go
// (reconnectConnection/deleteSupersededRef/existingConnectionStatus),
// split out purely to stay under the file-length cap; cleanupOrphanedRef
// stays here since both branches call it. The write shape the two
// branches share once their own row-level work is done — Audit + Emit +
// the workspace mode flip — is activateConnection (activation.go), so
// neither this file nor reconnect.go carries its own copy of it.
