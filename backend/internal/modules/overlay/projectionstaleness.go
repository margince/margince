// A mirror row holds a PROJECTION, and it is re-projected only when the
// incumbent's own baseline advances (mirrorstore.go's staleness guard). A
// mapping change therefore leaves already-mirrored rows holding a payload the
// current declaration would never produce, indefinitely — and the flip freezes
// the mirror and writes those payloads as durable native rows, so whatever a
// row holds at flip time becomes permanent. This file owns the one comparison
// that detects it, shared by the flip preflight (flipstate.go), the
// operator-facing sync status (syncstatus.go), and the sweep phase that
// converges those rows (StaleProjections, below) so the three can never
// disagree about which rows are out of date — the flip must block on exactly
// the rows the sweep re-fetches, or it blocks on rows nothing will ever clear.
//
// The one asymmetry is deliberate and runs the safe way: the sweep additionally
// skips a row it has already failed to re-project under today's declaration,
// because that read cannot come back different. The flip still blocks on it —
// the payload is no more current for having been recorded — so the skip drops
// the wasted incumbent call, never the guard.
