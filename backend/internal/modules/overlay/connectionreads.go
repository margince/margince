// disables webhook refresh for an otherwise-healthy connection.
//
// It is gated on the binding being unset (a cheap check first) so an
// already-bound connection costs no per-sweep network call. Like the sibling
// sweep checkpoints (overlay_sync_state, backfill cursors), this operational
// binding metadata is a plain UPDATE, not a domain mutation through the

// the next sweep retries), but the error is returned rather than swallowed here

// stamp its stale adapter's account id onto a DIFFERENT connection's row
// (which WorkspaceForPortal's fail-closed-on-ambiguity would then bind to
