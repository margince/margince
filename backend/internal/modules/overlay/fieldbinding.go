// the wire assembly's field pick — and nothing but this declaration connects

	// two slots claiming one key precisely so a real double-write cannot hide;
	// native_only would say no mirror could help, when the mirror is exactly
	// where the value comes from. The line between the two is whose data the
	// computation runs over — native_only computes from THIS installation's
	// own rows, derived computes from mirrored ones. DerivedFrom names the
	// wire slots it is computed from, and each must be mapped on the same
	// entity: a slot derived from something the mirror does not carry is
	// native_only wearing a friendlier name. What the gates reach stops
	// there, and an author declaring one should know it: they prove the named
	// sources are mapped and that the slot's value follows from the mirrored
