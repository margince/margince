// ErrConnectionGone is the sync-write fence's abort signal: a fenced write
// (MirrorStore.WithFence/WithFenceIdentity) found no active incumbent_connection
// for the workspace — OR, under WithFenceIdentity, found one active but under a
// DIFFERENT generation than the caller's own — so the connection this write
// believed it was serving is gone, either revoked or superseded by a reconnect,
// since the sweep that issued the write began. The sweep treats it as a clean
// STOP, never a failure — there is nothing to sync into a workspace that has
// left overlay mode (or that now belongs to a different connection this sweep
// never actually swept for), and the revoked connection is already gone from
// the due-scan. It is exported so compose (the sweep orchestration) can
// recognize it, but it is deliberately NOT an apperrors sentinel: it is an
// application-internal control signal that never crosses an HTTP/MCP
// boundary — the on-demand reconcile path maps it to apperrors.ErrModeNotOverlay
// before it could.
var ErrConnectionGone = errors.New("overlay: the incumbent connection was revoked mid-sweep")

// assertActiveConnection is the disconnect-race fence's STATUS-only form. It
// takes a SHARED lock on the workspace's active incumbent_connection row for
// the calling transaction. Disconnect (teardown.go) takes that same row FOR
// UPDATE and, in the SAME transaction, purges every incumbent-derived table
// and flips the workspace back to native. The two lock modes make a fenced
// sync write and a disconnect mutually exclusive on that row, so an in-flight
// write either:
//
//   - commits BEFORE the disconnect — its row is then purged by the
//     disconnect that was waiting on the shared lock; or
//   - runs AFTER the disconnect commits — it finds NO active connection row
//     and returns ErrConnectionGone, writing nothing.
//
// Either way a stray in-flight write can never resurrect incumbent-derived
// data into a DISCONNECTED workspace. overlay_mirror ingest is additionally
// tombstone-guarded in-SQL (mirrorstore.go's ingestSQL), but the association
// edges, mirror_user_map, and the sync-state backoff are not record-keyed and
// cannot be tombstoned — this fence is what protects THEM (and a brand-new
// mirror row that has no tombstone yet).
//
// A RECONNECTED workspace is a different matter from a disconnected one,
// and status alone does not cover it: it asks whether AN active connection
// exists, never whether it is the one the caller started under, and
// reconnectConnection revives the same row in place (status
// revoked→active, connected_at reset). A stray write from a caller that
// started under the PRIOR connection can still land after that reconnect
// commits. assertOwnConnection (below) closes this by checking the
// connection's IDENTITY too — see WithFenceIdentity's own doc
// (mirrorstore.go's fenced/identityFenced fields) for which callers engage
// it and why, and assertFence's for how a store's construction (WithFence
// vs WithFenceIdentity) — not the write itself — decides which check runs.
//
// The remaining gap is real and narrow: a write-back or an on-demand sweep
// request (writeaudit.go, RequestSweep) stays on plain WithFence, because
// closing it needs the shared per-request incumbent resolver
// (overlay.Provider.resolveIncumbent) to carry connectedAt, which it does
// not today. Concretely, a write-back straddling a disconnect+reconnect TO A
// DIFFERENT PORTAL can ingest portal A's record into portal B's mirror, and
// land a write-ledger echo entry under the new generation that could mask a
// genuine portal-B change as an echo.
//
// The fence is `status = 'active'` and nothing else, which is the whole
// selection: incumbent_connection holds one row per installation (its
// singleton index), so an active connection is THE connection.

// assertOwnConnection is assertActiveConnection plus the connection's

// (DueOverlayConnection.ConnectedAt / ActiveConnection's own read), and the
// predicate below requires the row active AND still carrying that same
// instant. A disconnect+reconnect resets connected_at (reconnect.go), so a
// write from a caller that straddles one gets ErrConnectionGone here exactly
// as it would from a disconnect alone — the write never LANDS under a
// connection the caller did not start under.
//
// capture_connection.generation (an incrementing int, CAP-DDL-2) fences the
// same class of race for capture's connections; overlay reuses connected_at
// instead of adding a parallel generation column because it is already the
// exact value every caller needs anyway (reconcileFloor's own input,
// design.md's connect-instant), reset on every lifecycle change the same way
// a generation bump would be — a second counter would track the first one
// in lockstep for no added guarantee.
//
// Reached via MirrorStore.assertFence for every fenced write EXCEPT the two
// checkpoint saves (SaveBackfillCursor/SaveReconcileWatermark,
// mirrorcheckpoints.go), which call this directly instead of going through
// assertFence: those two take connectedAt as an explicit parameter — not
// s.connectedAt — because a checkpoint (unlike a plain mirror row) is never
// revisited once it says done/advanced, so its identity check must never be
// implicit in how the STORE happened to be built. Landing one under the
// wrong generation would floor/short-circuit the new connection's own sync
// (reconcile.go's reconcileFloor) at a point it never actually reached —
// silently, and forever, since the watermark only advances and a done
// cursor is never re-listed.

// WithFence returns a MirrorStore identical to s with the disconnect-race

// disconnected, instead of resurrecting purged incumbent-derived data. Use
// this for a fenced write whose window is one bounded request (a human
// write-back, an on-demand sweep request) — the disconnect+reconnect
// straddle this file's own doc describes is real here too, but its race
// window is one request, not an unattended background sweep, so
// WithFenceIdentity's stronger guarantee is not needed (see
// assertActiveConnection's own doc for why closing it here would need a
// wider seam change). It is opt-in precisely so the read path and the many
// unit tests that ingest without standing up a connection are not forced to
// hold one.
//
// It explicitly clears identityFenced/connectedAt rather than inheriting
// them from s: WithFence is the WEAKER of the two constructors, so
// s.WithFenceIdentity(x).WithFence() must actually downgrade to status-only,
// not silently stay identity-checked because the stronger fields survived
// the copy. No production caller chains them today, but the method's own
