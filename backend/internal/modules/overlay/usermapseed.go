// nobody (nothing writes mirror_user_map otherwise) into serving exactly
// the users the incumbent actually owns records through. An owner with an
// empty email, or one no workspace user matches, is skipped — never
// guessed (fail-closed). Each matched pairing goes through UpsertUserMap,
// so it inherits that path's re-verification against the incumbent's
// current owner email and its atomic clear-then-grant visibility
// recompute (including the remap-revoke when a user was already mapped to
// a different owner). Per-owner failures are collected, not fatal: one
// owner whose email no longer resolves (a race between the directory pull
// and the re-check) must not stop the rest from seeding, so the errors
// are joined and returned for the caller to log while every seedable
// owner still lands.
//
// Cost: one app_user lookup per distinct-email owner per sweep — bounded
// by the owners-directory size (tens to low hundreds), not the record
// count, so it stays cheap at the scale this runs.
