// The write-back path's governance half: the audit_log row and the outbox
// event every overlay Update/Archive commits, alongside the mirror refresh
// that same write produced.
//
// Why this file exists at all. The mirror is a derived cache, and its sync
// writes are deliberately audit-free (mirrorstore.go's Ingest doc) — a
// poller refresh is not a domain mutation and auditing it would retain
// incumbent PII in audit_log for no compliance purpose. A HUMAN or agent
// write-back is the opposite case: it IS a domain mutation, made by an
// identified principal, against the record the incumbent holds. It carries
// the same attributable audit trail every native module write carries, or
// the overlay path would be the one mutation surface in this build where
// "who changed this record" has no answer.
//
// The ordering this shape can and cannot promise. The incumbent commits
// FIRST (design.md §4.5: incumbent-first, so a refusal upstream never
// leaves a local row claiming a write HubSpot never took), so the canonical
// row and our audit row cannot share one transaction — the canonical row is
// not in our database. What DOES commit atomically is the entire local half:
// the mirror refresh, the audit_log row, and the event_outbox row land in
// ONE transaction or none of them do. A caller therefore never sees a
// refreshed mirror row with no audit trail, nor an announced event whose
// audit row rolled back.
