// Connect's two branches — inserting a fresh incumbent_connection row
// (insertConnection, connection.go) and reviving a revoked one
// (reconnectConnection, reconnect.go) — end at the same place: an active
// connection, audited, announced, and reflected in the workspace's mode.
// That destination is one invariant regardless of which path the row took
// to get there, so activateConnection spells it once rather than letting
// the two branches carry their own copy that could quietly drift apart.
