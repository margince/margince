// This file owns Disconnect's teardown (design.md §4.9, OVA-AC-1): revoke
// the connection, purge the mirror replica, tombstone what it purges, and
// flip the workspace back to native mode — all in ONE transaction so a
// crash mid-teardown can never leave the workspace half in overlay mode
// with its mirror gone (or vice versa). The vault delete runs after
// commit: it has no transaction to join, and deleting the credential
// before the row that names it is durably revoked would risk stranding a
// "connected" row with no resolvable secret.
//
// Scoping note on design.md §4.9's "scrub/redact incumbent-derived
// content from retained augmentation": audit_log is immutable BY
// CONSTRUCTION (migrations/core/0012_audit_log.up.sql's
// trg_audit_no_mutate trigger RAISEs on every UPDATE/DELETE, for every
// role, no exception) — the P12 spine, not a policy this module may
// carve an exception into. privacy.Eraser (the Art. 17 engine) already
// establishes the pattern this follows: redaction targets MUTABLE
// domain rows (there, activity/lead columns via redactSubjectTimeline);
// its own erasure tombstone carries counts in evidence, never touches
// an existing row's before/after. Branch 1 is read-only — no
// activity/approval/agent-output row ever copies a mirrored field into
// its own domain columns — so there is currently no mutable row for
// this teardown to scrub. This is the honest state of branch 1, not a
// gap: when branch 2 (or a note-taking surface) lands a path that
// copies incumbent data into a domain row, THAT path's own erase/redact
// support is what closes this, the same way privacy's redaction covers
// activities today.

// on and would otherwise leave the workspace claiming to read from an
// incumbent it no longer has a connection to.

// non-preserved column on the workspace row to its declared default — these

// incidental: whether the
// installation was in overlay mode is only knowable before something writes
// the column, and only this call reports it.

// mirror load outright, and a stale watermark resumes the incremental
// sweep past everything it never saw. A disconnected workspace's sync
// state must read exactly as a never-connected one's does ("", not

// table, and its fixed-window counters expire on their own TTL — there is
