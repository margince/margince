// Operand checking: does the value a clause carries match the KIND the field
// was admitted with, and is it in the member the operator actually reads.
//
// It sits beside the validator rather than inside it because it answers a
// different question. The validator decides whether a NAME is in the caller's
// vocabulary — the security boundary. This decides whether a VALUE has the
// shape that name's type takes, which is a question about the caller's data and
// not about their authority. Keeping the two apart is what lets the vocabulary
// half be read on its own.
