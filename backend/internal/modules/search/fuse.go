// types narrows BOTH lanes to the record types asked for, and narrowing
// them is not the same as filtering the fused page afterwards: the page
// is a global top-N, so post-filtering spends it on types the caller
// never asked about and can answer nothing for a record type that is
// simply less similar overall than five others. Empty means every type.
//
// The BOOL says whether the vector lane actually contributed. Every caller
// that publishes its ranking as semantic owes the answer that word, and there
// are two ways to lose the lane — see degradeToLexical.
