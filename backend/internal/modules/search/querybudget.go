// What a plan is allowed to COST, and what it answers when it costs more.
//
// The page limit bounds the rows a plan RETURNS and not the rows it visits: a
// traversal compiles to a LATERAL join re-executed once per outer candidate
// row, and a predicate that matches almost nothing still makes the planner walk
// the table to prove it. So the ceiling is a time budget, spent by whichever of
// the plan's two transactions gets there first, and running out of it is an
// answer rather than a fault.

// CodePlanExceededBudget is the note a plan carries when the statement ran out
// of time and was abandoned, so the answer has NO rows rather than a short page
// of them.
//
// A plan can cost far more than its page suggests — a traversal is a nested
// loop, and a predicate that matches almost nothing still walks the table to
// prove it — so a caller told only that the answer is partial would read the
// empty page as an empty workspace.

//
// It parameterizes the production executor rather than standing in for it: what
// a test chooses is the number, and the bounded handle, the classification and
// the answer it produces are the ones a caller gets. The budget is fixed at
// construction because compose builds ONE executor that every request shares —
// a setter on it would be a ceiling one request could change under another.
//
// A zero budget means unbounded, because a duration's zero value cannot be told
// apart from one nobody set. Nothing guards against passing it: NewQueryExecutor

// then the only thing between an empty answer and a wrong conclusion, so it

// deadline as this plan being too slow describes their timeout as a property of
// the workspace, and there is nobody left to read the answer anyway. The live
// context separates that case, which is why the classification lives here, with
// the caller that holds one.

// An operator cancelling the backend under a live request reads as a spent
// budget, and is left that way: both mean the statement was stopped before it
// answered, and narrowing the plan is the caller's move either way.
