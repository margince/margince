// What order an answer comes back in, once SQL has returned the rows.
//
// There are three orders a plan can ask for and only two of them are settled in
// SQL. The exact lane orders by t.id there; a radius orders by distance there.
// The similarity lane cannot — the retriever ranked the ids before the
// statement ran, so the ordering is applied here afterwards.
//
// Which of these two functions runs is the whole decision: orderByRank imposes
// the retriever's order, scoreOnly leaves SQL's alone. A radius plan takes the
// second, because it was already sorted nearest-first and re-sorting would undo
// the answer's whole point.

// It exists for the one plan that asks for both a radius and a similarity: the
// rows come back nearest-first from SQL, and that is the order the answer keeps
// — but a caller reading a score still deserves the real one rather than a
// zero. Splitting this out of orderByRank keeps the two decisions separate:
// what the order IS, and what the scores ARE.

// why it needs no class of its own.
//
// Truncation is a verdict on the EXACT lane only. A ranked answer is a top-N
// by construction — that is what ranked_semantic says — so counting its bound
// as a degradation would leave the verdict unreachable and tell a caller
// nothing they did not ask for.
