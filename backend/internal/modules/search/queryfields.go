// The CORE half of the query vocabulary, derived from the generated contract
// types rather than maintained as a list (C-7, SEARCH-AC-15).
//
// The contract is this repo's source of truth (P3), and the generated structs
// ARE the contract — so a vocabulary read off them cannot drift from what the
// API actually returns. A field added upstream is askable the moment the
// contract regenerates; a field removed leaves with it. There is no second
// place to update and therefore no second place to forget.
//
// Everything about a field is derived: its wire name from the json tag, its
// kind from its Go type, its operators from its kind. The only hand-written
// thing here is the BINDING from a searchable entity to its contract type —
// Go reflection cannot enumerate a package's types — and the fitness function
// in queryvocab_test.go fails the moment a searchable entity has no binding.
