	// child whose process dies leaves a running row nothing will ever retry or

	// for good, and no job anywhere to explain why. So a human keeps a way back.
	//
	// What makes the bound meaningful is that a working PASS keeps its marker
	// fresh: ReembedWorkspace refreshes it around every leg of its own work, so a
	// pass leaves the marker unmoved for no longer than one entity-table scan, or
	// ReembedProgressStaleness plus one embedding upsert, whichever is the longer.
	// Neither of those is a bound this code can enforce — ReembedProgressStaleness
	// says why.
	//
	// A RUN is more than its passes, and three of its legs move the marker not at
	// all: the wait between the claim and the dispatcher's fan-out, a child's
	// queue wait while no sibling of it is running, and the retry backoff between
	// a child's attempts, which River's attempt⁴ ladder stretches into minutes by
	// the last one. A window set here has to clear those too, and it clears all of
	// them the same way: by judgement about how long each plausibly takes, never
	// by proof that a healthy run cannot be dispossessed.
	//
	// What a steal stops, exactly: the dispossessed run's MARKER WRITES. Its
	// children carry a Run the marker no longer names, so their progress notes,
	// their FinishWorkspaceReembedding and their release all match no row and
	// cannot move — let alone release — the new run's set.
	//
	// What a steal does NOT stop: the children themselves. Nothing here cancels
	// a River job, and the new run's children carry a different Run in their
	// args, so ByArgs uniqueness does not suppress them either — both fleets run
	// at once. That is real model spend, not a no-op, and it is accepted rather
	// than overlooked: UpsertEmbedding's content-hash skip-compare means the
	// loser of the race per entity re-embeds nothing, so the overspend is
	// bounded by whatever was genuinely stale when the steal happened, and a
	// steal only fires against a run that has already stopped reporting progress.

// of step, and it can only report BETWEEN them: one liveEntitiesOf scan, and one
// UpsertEmbedding. Both wait on pool acquisition and on row locks before doing
// any work of their own, and neither of those waits is bounded by anything this
// package controls — the model lane's per-call timeout caps only the model call
// inside an upsert. So the honest bound over a pass is the longer of one scan and
// this interval plus one upsert, where the second term is a wall time no code
