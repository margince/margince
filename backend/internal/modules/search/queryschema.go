// VocabularyDocument answers the SAME document ReadResource serves, for a

//
// WHY A SECOND DOOR EXISTS. `query_workspace` refuses every name outside the
// vocabulary and its description sends the caller to margince://schema/query to
// learn what the names are. That instruction assumes the caller can read a
// resource, and a large share of MCP clients — Claude's connector among them —
// surface tools only. For those callers the loop had no exit: the tool named a
// document they could not open, then refused each guess by name. Observed on
// 2026-08-26, a client probed four field spellings, was correctly refused four
// times, and reported to its user that this workspace had no address field at
// all — while `within_radius` sat in the vocabulary it could not read.
//
// ONE COMPUTATION, TWO DOORS. This renders `querySchemaDocument` over the same
// resolver ReadResource does, so both answer one document rather than two that
// can disagree — which is the reason the grammar was never inlined into the
// tool's input schema either: a hand-written copy would be a maintained
// restatement of exactly what is derived.
//
// Held by: TestBothDoorsAnswerOneVocabulary (queryschematool_test.go)

// already read, so a caller learns nothing here they could not learn by asking.
