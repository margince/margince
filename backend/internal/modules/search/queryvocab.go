package search

// The resolved query vocabulary: what a plan may name, for ONE caller, right
// now (SEARCH-PARAM-7). It is composed rather than stored, from three sources
// that each already answer their part of the question:
//
//   - the generated contract types, for the core fields (queryfields.go);
//   - the live custom-field catalog, through the fieldcatalog seam, for the
//     workspace's own columns;
//   - object RBAC, for which record types this principal may read at all.
//
// Nothing here is a list to maintain, which is the property SEARCH-AC-15
// tests: a custom field added is askable on the next resolve and a retired
// one is gone, with no edit anywhere.
//
// The RBAC filter is what makes the vocabulary PER-CALLER (SEARCH-AC-16). A
// record type the principal cannot read contributes no fields and no
// relations, so naming one of its fields is refused exactly as an invented
// name is — same code, same wording. A vocabulary that refused it differently
// would be a field-discovery channel: probe until the wording changes.
