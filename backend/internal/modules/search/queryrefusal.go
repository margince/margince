// The typed clarification a refused plan carries (SEARCH-AC-14): what was not
// understood, where, and what to do instead. It rides apperrors.FieldFaults,
// the plural fault form, so a plan with three bad predicates names all three
// — a caller told about the first of three has to make three round trips to
// learn what it could have learned in one.
//
// Implementing the shared fault interface is also what makes the refusal
// legible on every transport at once: the httperr choke point renders it as a
// 422 naming each path, and the MCP tool surface renders the same list
// in-band, with neither side hand-writing a mapping.
