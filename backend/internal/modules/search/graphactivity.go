// The activity anchor: preparing for a meeting by DEREFERENCING it.
//
// An activity is still a link, not a thing links hang off — graph.go's walk is
// unchanged and the graph keeps exactly the anchors it had. Naming an activity
// as the anchor asks a different question: which records is this event about?
// The event answers from its own links and participants, ONE of those records
// becomes the subject, and the ordinary record walk runs around that.
//
// The answer says what it chose and what it did not. `prepared_for` names the
// subject the walk used, `also_present` names every other record the event
// resolved to, and `unresolved_attendees` names the addresses that matched
// nobody — so an empty prep is actionable ("this event names nobody we hold,
// and here is who was on it") rather than silent.
