// The user↔contact interaction edge (CG-DDL-1 / ADR-0078): which of our people
// interacts with which contact, how much, how recently.
//
// It is a PROJECTION. Every row is folded from activity_participant rows and
// holds no fact of its own, so it can be thrown away and rebuilt at any time —
// which is exactly the corruption remedy, and why it carries no audit or
// outbox row of its own.
//
// The maintenance rule that matters: RECOMPUTE, never increment. The event bus
// is at-least-once, so an increment would double-count on redelivery; and
// merge, archive and erasure all correct history BACKWARDS, which an increment
// cannot express at all. Recomputing a pair from the base tables is idempotent
// by construction — the same statement run five times leaves the same row —
// and that property is worth more than the writes it costs.
