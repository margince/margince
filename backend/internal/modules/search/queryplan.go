// The v1 query-plan grammar (search-and-retrieval SEARCH-PARAM-7 / A140).
// A plan is what a natural-language layer compiles an utterance INTO, and
// this file is the whole of what a plan may say: a target, exact predicates,
// one similarity clause, one traversal hop, a limit.
//
// The grammar is the first half of the security boundary and the reason the
// shape below has no free-text member anywhere a name is expected. There is
// nowhere in it to put a table, a fragment of SQL or an expression: those can
// only arrive as the VALUE of a closed member, where the vocabulary refuses
// them. The second half is queryvalidate.go, which decides membership; this
// file only decides shape.
