// The third spelling of a reference: an edge that lives in NEITHER record.
//
// The two derivations in queryfields.go read a scalar `<record type>_id` member
// off a contract type — the referring record's own for a forward hop, another
// record's for the inverse. Both spellings put the reference ON one of the two
// records, which is why an edge carried by a table between them was invisible
// by construction rather than by omission: there was no member to read it off.
//
// What makes one rule enough for both join tables in this schema is that they
// are the same shape physically. `activity_link` carries `person_id`,
// `organization_id`, `deal_id` and `lead_id`; `relationship` carries
// `person_id`, `organization_id`, `deal_id` and `project_id`. The contract's
// `ActivityLink{entity_id, entity_type}` is the WIRE shape of a link and not
// its storage — the columns are typed, and a CHECK constraint says which one
// each row fills. So the rule reads columns, exactly as the field vocabulary
// does, and never has to know what a link means.
