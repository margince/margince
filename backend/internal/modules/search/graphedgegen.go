// The cg:graph-edge consumer: what keeps CG-DDL-1 true as records change.
//
// Every handler here RECOMPUTES from the base tables rather than adjusting a
// counter. That is not a stylistic preference. The bus is at-least-once, so an
// adjustment double-counts on redelivery; and merge, archive and erasure
// correct history backwards, which an adjustment cannot express at all.
// Recomputing is idempotent by construction, so redelivery is free and
// correctness does not depend on each event arriving exactly once.
//
// The invalidation set is the part that is easy to get wrong, so it is written
// out rather than inferred:
//
//	activity.captured/updated/archived → the pairs that activity's
//	    participants imply, including the pair it USED to belong to when a
//	    human relinks it to someone else.
//	person.merged   → the source person's edges go, the target's are refolded.
//	person.archived/restored → that contact's edges are refolded.
//	ERASURE is NOT here, deliberately. It drops the edges inside its own
//	    transaction (privacy/erasure.go), because an erasure obligation that
//	    depends on an event being delivered fails silently when the bus is
//	    behind. This consumer previously listened for a `person.erased` event
//	    that no path emits, so every erasure left its edges standing.
//	user.deactivated → nothing. Reads filter through the live-member join, so
//	    a departure takes effect without rewriting a single row.
