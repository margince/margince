// Where a vocabulary field actually lives.
//
// E1 derived the vocabulary from the CONTRACT. Execution happens against the
// DATABASE, and the two do not agree. `strength.score` is a view assembled from
// activity rows, `partner.margin_tier` belongs to another table, `deal.stalled`
// is computed in a mapper, and `organization.logo_url` is minted from an object
// key at read time. Roughly forty published fields have no column on the
// record's own table.
//
// So a field is askable when the contract declares it AND the record's own
// table can answer it. Both halves stay derived — the second from
// information_schema, which is the database's own statement of what it holds —
// so neither becomes a list to maintain, and the property C-7 asked for
// survives. TestEveryPublishedFieldCompilesToAStoragePath is the fitness
// function that keeps the two halves in agreement.
//
// Two rules make the catalog read safe to use here:
//
//  1. It FILTERS; it never CONTRIBUTES. A name only ever leaves the vocabulary
//     by it. cf_* columns are physically present for every workspace that
//     declared one, so a catalog read used as a source would hand one
//     workspace's private column to the next caller. The custom half keeps
//     coming from the workspace-scoped fieldcatalog seam.
//  2. It is a SCHEMA read, not a tenant read — information_schema carries no
//     rows of anyone's data.
