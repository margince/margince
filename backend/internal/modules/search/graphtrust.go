// The retrieval trust ladder: how much a piece of evidence counts for, based
// on who put it there. It is one of the three terms in rankScore (graph.go),
// and the only one that is about provenance rather than about the query or
// the clock. rankScore itself lives here with it, because the three weights
// and the ladder are one formula — §10.7.2 — and reading half of it elsewhere
// is how the ladder came to be keyed off the wrong column in the first place.

// The trust factor: a human statement outranks an agent write outranks
// captured external content — the T0/T1/T2 ladder.
//
// IT IS KEYED OFF WHO SAID IT, not off the channel the row arrived through.
// The ladder used to read activity.source, where `manual` scored 1.0 and `mcp`
// scored 0.7. That worked only while the two words happened to line up with
// human and agent, and they no longer do: an agent tool call and a human form
// submission both write source=manual, so a channel-keyed ladder would hand
// every agent-written note full human-statement trust — silently, and exactly
// inside the retrieval path that answers questions about a company's history.
//
// captured_by is the authenticated principal, stamped by the write path and
// never taken from a request body, and it already spells the distinction the
// ladder is about: `human:<user>` or `agent:<passport>`.
