// Commission row visibility, which is INHERITED rather than owned.
//
// The shared row-scope helpers interpolate the tables that answer `owner_id`
// and reject a table name they do not know rather than guessing, so
// commission_entry cannot join them: there is no column for their clauses to
// test.
//
// An entry is visible when the deal it was accrued on is visible. Deriving it
// rather than copying an owner at accrual is what makes a deal reassignment
// carry its commission entries in the same query, instead of leaving them
// behind with the representative who no longer works the account.
//
// There is only one anchor. Unlike a contract, an entry cannot exist without a
// deal — deal_id is NOT NULL — so there is no organization fallback arm.
