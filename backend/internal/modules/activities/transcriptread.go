// The run record for reading a meeting transcript for the next steps in it
// (S-E04.3), and the four store methods that move one through its life.
//
// A model call takes seconds and can fail, so it cannot run inside the request
// that asks for it: the POST answers 202 with a read id and the client polls
// this row until it is terminal. Deep read (people/siteread.go) is the same
// shape for the same reason, and this mirrors it deliberately rather than
// inventing a second vocabulary for the same idea.
//
// This module owns the row; it does not own the reading. The engine that calls
// the model and stages the proposals lives in compose, because a module never
// imports the ai module or a sibling — compose claims the row, reports on it,
// and finishes it through the methods here.
