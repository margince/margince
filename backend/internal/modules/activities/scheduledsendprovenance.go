// WHO scheduled a message, frozen at the moment they asked for it (core 0260).
//
// Separate from the scheduling mechanics because it answers a different
// question. The rest of the module decides whether a deferred message may be
// written and when it fires; this decides what the record says about the actor
// that asked — which is what an incident investigation reads, and the one fact
// the fire path cannot reconstruct later.

// agentProvenance is WHO scheduled a message when the actor was not a human,
// frozen at schedule time.
//
// The human's id is already in `scheduled_by` and is not enough: two agents, or
// two passports, acting for the same person are the same human and different
// actors, and an audit trail has to tell them apart. Rebuilding an agent
// identity from the human's id at fire invents an actor that never existed,
// which is the attribution chain ADR-0055 rests on.
//
// This is a RECORD, not authority. The fire path still re-reads the human's
// live seat and grants and holds the message if they no longer permit it — a
// revoked passport must stop the send, and a stored one must never resurrect
// it. What is stored answers "who asked for this"; what is read live answers
// "may it still go".
type agentProvenance struct {
	ActorID    *string
	PassportID *ids.UUID
	OnBehalfOf *ids.UUID

// provenanceOf captures the acting agent, or nothing at all for a human.
//
// agent_on_behalf_of is the HUMAN behind the agent, and it is taken only from
// OnBehalfOf — never from UserID, which is a different fact.
//
// On the agent path that can reach a send the two hold the same value anyway:
// identity mints the principal from one field (AgentIdentity.Principal sets
// UserID and OnBehalfOf from the same a.OnBehalfOf). The rule is not about
// today's callers though. An agent principal whose UserID names the AGENT's own
// app_user row rather than a person is a shape this tree has carried before, and
// copying that into a column meaning "the human behind this" would write an
// agent's id where a human's belongs. The fire path then hands it to
// actor.OnBehalfOf, which auth.Admit reads to derive seat and RBAC: a fabricated
// authority, which is the same class of defect this whole record exists to end.
//
// An agent with no OnBehalfOf therefore stores its id and NO human, rather than
// either a guess or nothing at all. Storing nothing would be worse than the
// guess: a new row with no actor id is indistinguishable from a pre-0260 row,
// and the fire path reads that as "this row cannot say which agent it was" and
// falls back to the derived `agent:<human-uuid>` — putting back the invented
// identity for exactly the actor whose real id was in hand.
