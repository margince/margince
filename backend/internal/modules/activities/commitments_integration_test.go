// What the open-promise read discloses, against a real database and a real
// row scope.
//
// Both claims here answer SUCCESSFULLY when they are broken, which is why they
// need a database rather than a string assertion over the built SQL. Delete
// `AND `+visible from attachTaskAbout and every unit test in this package still
// passes — the deal's name simply appears in an answer it should not be in.
// Delete the narrowing gate and a caller learns a project exists by asking
// about its promises. Neither failure raises anything.
//
// The rows are seeded as the table OWNER, so the reads below run against rows
// this store did not write — the shape a real workspace has.
