// The run record for reading one attached document for the deal facts it
// states (RD-DDL-4), and the store methods that move one through its life.
//
// A model call takes seconds and can fail, so it cannot run inside the request
// that asks for it: the POST answers 202 with a reading id and the client polls
// this row until it is terminal. transcriptread.go is the same shape for the
// same reason, and this mirrors it deliberately rather than inventing a second
// vocabulary for one idea.
//
// The one place it does NOT mirror the transcript reading is that this row
// stores its result. A transcript reading produces approval rows that are their
// own authority object (ADR-0036); a document reading produces nothing durable
// but this, and the accept validates a human's choice against exactly the
// fields they were shown (RD-AC-N-5).
//
// This module owns the row; it does not own the reading. The engine that calls
// the model lives in compose, because a module never imports the ai module —
// compose claims the row, reports on it, and finishes it through the methods
// here.
//
// This file is the DOOR's half: starting a reading, joining one already in
// flight, re-arming an abandoned one, and reading the result back. The worker's
// half — claim, finish, release — is extractionclaim.go, because those three
// are the ones scoped to a single claim and reached under a different
// principal.
