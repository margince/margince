// What the pipeline trace needs to know about one activity, answered HERE
// rather than by the reader.
//
// The trace explains why a stage did or did not run. For the attention
// classifier that answer is a predicate this module owns, and a reader that
// re-spelled it would be a second copy: correct on the day it was written and
// silently wrong the first time the backlog's WHERE clause moved. That is the
// exact defect class the trace exists to expose, so reproducing it inside the
// trace would be the worst possible bug.
//
// ClassifyBacklogPredicate is therefore ONE string, used verbatim by the backlog
// query and by the single-row question below. They cannot disagree, because
// there is nothing to disagree with.
