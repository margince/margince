// Capture stamps participants for mail it ingests. A rep who logs a call or a
// meeting themselves goes through this path instead, and it has to record the
// same fact or the two halves of the timeline answer "who was in it"
// differently — which would show up as a colleague's relationship silently
// depending on HOW the conversation was recorded.
//
// Both ends are known here without inference. The human logging it is the
// authenticated principal, and the counterparty is whichever person the caller
// linked — a link the store has already put through the row-scope gate.
