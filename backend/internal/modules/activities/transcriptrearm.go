// claimed it was killed, timed out, or exhausted its retries. Nothing else
// would ever pick it up — a finished job is not re-enqueued, and
// uq_transcript_read_inflight makes the corpse block every new reading of that
// transcript — so without this the transcript is unreadable for good.
//
// Pressing the button again is therefore the recovery path, which is also the
// thing a rep would try unprompted.
