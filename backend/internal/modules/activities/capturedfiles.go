// The files a captured message carried, becoming attachment rows.
//
// This lives in the module that OWNS the attachment table rather than in the
// one that reads the mailbox. Capture drives the transaction and supplies the
// files; the row shape, the account roll-up and the idempotency key are this
// module's, exactly as they are for a human upload. Two writers of one table
// with two spellings of its invariants is how the two come to disagree.
//
// ORDER IS THE DESIGN. The bytes go to object storage BEFORE the transaction
// that records them, the same order UploadAttachment uses and for the same
// reason: the worst outcome of a failure between the two is an object nobody
// references, and the alternative is a row promising bytes that are not there.
// One is invisible and reclaimable; the other is a broken download on a surface
// whose whole promise is that a cited file opens. Reclaiming the unreferenced
// object is not done here and is owed by both writers of this table (#663).
