// Stamping a project's correspondence as commercial (D5).
//
// The deal writer beside this one (retentionstamp.go) stamps a whole deal's
// correspondence at the instant the deal qualifies — one event, many
// activities. A project never has such an instant: it is a commercial
// engagement that qualifies from the moment it exists and keeps accumulating
// correspondence for years. So the LINK is the event, and this stamps one
// activity at the moment it is filed under a project.
//
// That difference is why the two are separate functions rather than one with a
// flag: they are triggered by different things and read different rows. What
// they share is the shape of the write — class onto the activity, evidence
// beside it, one statement, inside the caller's transaction — and that shape is
// the part that must not diverge, which is why this file sits next to its
// sibling rather than in the file that files links.

// StampCorrespondenceForProject marks one activity as commercial
// correspondence because it has just been filed under a project, and records
// what qualified it, inside the caller's transaction.
//
// It runs INSIDE the transaction that writes the link, not on the event bus,
// for the reason the deal seam already states: the gap between qualifying and
// stamping is a window in which an erasure sees unclassified correspondence and
// destroys it, and there is no recovering from that.
//
// IDEMPOTENT. An activity may be filed, unfiled and filed again under the same
// project, and it may already carry a class from a deal that also qualified it.
// The class is write-once in the database (activity_refuse_restricted_mutation),
// so this only stamps a row carrying no class yet, and the evidence insert
// tolerates the row it already wrote.
//
// PERMANENT. Relinking the activity away from the project does not unstamp it,
// and neither does archiving or closing the project. The class is monotonic and
// the evidence is frozen: over-retention is an argument to have with a
// supervisory authority, destruction is irreversible.
