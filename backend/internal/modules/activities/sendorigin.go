// A send starts either as a reply or as a new conversation, and ADR-0087
// makes that choice explicit rather than inferring it from a missing anchor.
// An accidentally absent anchor would otherwise become a new conversation
// silently, losing a reply's threading with no signal anyone could see.
//
// Both origins resolve to the SAME two facts — the threading chain the
// message carries and the record links its timeline row inherits — and
// everything after that resolution is one code path, which is what keeps
// the authorization order, the consent gate, deliverability derivation,
// identity minting and the single-transaction staging from forking.
