// The race the re-key can lose, and what folding its winner in costs. Capture
// cannot learn of a send until the send is recorded, so an echo of our own
// message that arrived first already holds the identity the re-key is about to
// claim. Our row survives — it holds the delivery, the consent purpose and the
// draft outcome, none of which capture can recreate — and the echo gives up its
// natural key and its place on the timeline, keeping everything else.
//
// Three properties the cases below pin, because each is one a refactor could
// undo without any of the others noticing: the survivor GAINS what the echo
// derived, the echo KEEPS the links erasure reaches its own derived rows by,
// and only a row shaped like this message's echo may be folded in at all.
