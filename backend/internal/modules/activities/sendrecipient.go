// An account-started send names its own addressees, which a reply never
// does — a reply inherits the conversation it answers. So this is the one
// outbound path where a caller can type an address that belongs to nobody
// on file, and ADR-0087 §2 refuses that rather than accepting it.
//
// The refusal is a FIELD fault naming the address, not a generic validation
// error, because the composer's job at that moment is to offer the fix:
// attach this address to a contact, or pick a different recipient. A caller
// who cannot see which address was the problem cannot act on either.

// caller's row scope excludes is answered the same as one on nobody at all.
// Telling the two apart would leak the existence of a record through a
// composer field, which is the disclosure the row-scope gate exists to
// prevent everywhere else.
