// The noise disposition's two-stage effect on captured mail (ADR-0072/A118):
// hide it now, redact its content later. Both write the activity row, so both
// live here — the capture verdict engine drives them and never touches activity
// SQL.
//
// Both act on the SENDER, not on one message. A disposition is idempotent per
// address: the second and third mail from the same stranger join the open
// question rather than raising their own, so the ledger row names only the
// message that happened to arrive first. An effect keyed on that one id would
// hide message #1 and leave #2 and #3 on the timeline with their full bodies —
// "noise is not shown" defeated by sending two emails instead of one. The
// verdict decides whether this ADDRESS is a counterparty, so its effect covers
// every message that address sent.
//
// This is the ONE sanctioned hide-then-redact, and the shape matters. Hiding is
// immediate and recoverable, but un-archiving alone is not the recovery — the
// sweep would simply hide it again on the next tick. The recovery is to WRITE to
// the sender: correspondence is the T1 signal that they are a counterparty, and
// capture's noise scope stops applying to an address the workspace has replied
// to. Redaction is delayed by an undo window and nulls the content in place —
// the rows, their natural keys and their provenance survive as the tombstones
// that stop a replay from re-capturing what was just redacted. Neither stage
// deletes a row: a mistaken verdict must always leave something to recover from,
// and a hard delete would also let the same message land again tomorrow.
//
// Contrast the capture LABEL (capturelabel.go), which routes attention and
// changes nothing else. A noise VERDICT is a different authority: it decided the
// sender is not a counterparty at all, and it is confidence-floored precisely
// because it is allowed to hide things.
