// Who the recipient sees a message is from.

// Separate from the signature seam beside it, and deliberately: a signature is
// what the sender WROTE and this is who they ARE. They also come from different
// owners — the signature is the person's own text, the display name is the seat
// the identity module holds — and a message can honestly carry one without the
// other.
//
// A From header with no display name shows the address's local part in every
// mail client, so a message from lars@gradion.com arrives from "lars". The name
// exists in app_user; this seam is how it reaches the wire.

// It takes no user id, unlike SignatureFor: the identity module resolves the
// acting human itself. Note that it resolves an AGENT to the human it acts for,
// which is right for a draft and wrong for an envelope — senderDisplayName
// below refuses that case rather than passing it through.

// An agent send carries NO name, for the same reason it carries no signature:
// it acts under a human's authority but it is not that human, and a message
// arriving under somebody's name claims a hand that never touched it. The
// approval authorizes the sending; it does not make the approver the author.
// ActorIdentity resolves an agent to the human it acts for — which is right for
// a draft, where the model needs to know who it writes AS — so the refusal has
// to be made here rather than left to that resolution.
//
// The From header is the stronger claim of the two: a signature sits at the
// bottom of a message somebody may not read, and this is the line the inbox
// shows before anything is opened. Naming a human there while deliberately
// withholding their sign-off below would be the same lie told louder.
//
// Empty is never an error otherwise. A system principal, a seat this workspace
// no longer holds, and a member with no display name on file all resolve to
// nothing — and a bare address is a correct From header. Refusing to send
// because a name could not be read would trade a cosmetic gap for a delivery
// failure.
