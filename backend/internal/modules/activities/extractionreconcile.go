// ExtractionActivityReconcileWindow bounds how far back a settled reading is
// re-announced.
//
// It is wider than the projection's live set on purpose: a settled reading
// whose closing event was lost renders forever as whatever it last was —
// running, most damagingly — and the only way the projection learns otherwise
// is a pass that says so again. It is narrower than the projection's retention,
// because re-announcing a reading the projection has already aged out would
// resurrect it.
const ExtractionActivityReconcileWindow = 24 * time.Hour

// reconcileExtractionSQL selects the readings whose current state the
// projection could still be wrong about: everything live, and everything
// settled recently enough that a wrong display would still be on screen.
//
// TWO ARMS rather than one OR, and that is what makes it indexable: a predicate
// of `status IN ('queued','running') OR finished_at > $1` can use neither
// partial index, so every pass would scan the whole reading history and sort
// it. Each arm here matches one of the two partial indexes attachment_extraction
// carries for exactly this pass.
//
// Each arm carries its OWN budget, and the union is not re-limited. A single
// outer LIMIT would be filled from the live arm first — Postgres evaluates
// UNION ALL in order — so on an installation holding a full batch of live
// readings the settled arm would never be reached, and the settled arm is the
// one that repairs the worst display there is: a reading whose closing event
// was lost renders as running forever.
//
// Ordered by activity_announced_at, oldest first, NULLS FIRST — the pass's
// ROTATION KEY, and the reason a bounded batch makes progress at all. Ordering
// by anything an announce does not change selects the same rows every tick
// forever: a reading past the batch bound would never be reconciled, and a
// permanently-live one (a job discarded after its attempts, which strands the
// row until a human presses the button again) would occupy a slot and write a
// ledger row every tick for an announcement the guard then refuses.
