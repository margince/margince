// The account's document library, and the metadata a human asserts on a file.
//
// A document reachable from a company may hang off a deal, a person, an activity
// or the company itself, and each of those has its OWN visibility. So the
// roll-up scopes every candidate through its own primary parent rather than
// filtering afterwards: a contract on a deal the viewer cannot see contributes
// neither a row nor a count. A total that includes invisible rows tells the
// viewer something about them, which is the disclosure the parent gate exists to
// prevent (DOC-AC-2).
//
// `organization_id` on the row is a READ PATH, not a second parent. It makes the
// roll-up affordable at a hundred documents; it never decides who may see one.
