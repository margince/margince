// The channel reply (telegram-oa design §8.1, §8.5) — SendEmail's sibling, and
// the one path both transports commit through: the human's reply box on the
// timeline and the agent surface's send_message verb.
//
// What it SHARES with mail is what governs a send: the order of the gates
// (authorization refuses before consent answers), the default-deny consent
// check, and one transaction holding the timeline row and the delivery
// together. What differs is only the vocabulary of the transport:
//
//   - the recipient is RESOLVED from the conversation, never named by the
//     caller. A channel identity is an opaque third-party account id, so a
//     caller able to name one could message a human this conversation is not
//     with — and the reply surface has no legitimate use for that;
//   - reachability replaces address validity: a live identity that has not
//     blocked the workspace's bot;
//   - the outbound activity carries no subject and no natural key, because a
//     channel has no subject line and the provider files no echo of the sent
//     message for a key to collapse onto.
