// SendEmail decides WHETHER a message may go, and this decides what the
// timeline and the delivery each receive once it may. The split matters most
// where the two rows deliberately DIFFER — the wire body carries a live
// unsubscribe token and the recorded one carries a redacted copy, and having
// both projections in one place is what keeps that difference deliberate.
