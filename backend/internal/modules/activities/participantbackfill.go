// Recovering the participants of activities captured before ACT-DDL-3 existed
// (ADR-0078).
//
// Capture stamps participants going forward, but every message already in the
// timeline predates the table. Without this, the whole who-knows-whom surface
// reads empty on a workspace with years of history until new mail happens to
// arrive — which is indistinguishable, to the person looking at it, from the
// feature not working.
//
// It runs as a resumable job rather than an UPDATE inside migration 0157. A
// migration holds a lock on the table for its whole duration, and a workspace
// with a real mailbox has hundreds of thousands of activity rows; a slow
// backfill inside the migration turns a deploy into an outage.
//
// Two classes are recovered here, and the second is the one that matters:
//
//	Class 1 — an activity a human logged. `captured_by` reads `human:<uuid>`,
//	so the user is stated on the row. Exact, no inference.
//
//	Class 2 — an activity a connector captured. `captured_by` reads
//	`connector:gmail` and names no human, but capture_connection is
//	per-user-per-provider, so the provider identifies the mailbox owner — as
//	long as the workspace has exactly ONE connection for that provider. With
//	two, the activity could belong to either mailbox and no evidence on the
//	row distinguishes them, so it stays unattributed rather than being
//	attributed to a coin flip. A wrong edge is worse than a missing one: it
//	tells someone to ask a colleague who has never met the contact.
//
// Deliberately NOT recovered here: parsing raw From/To/attendee headers out of
// the stored originals. That is the pass that would recover calendar history,
// and it is a different kind of work — it reads message bodies, needs its own
// address-matching rules, and its failure mode is silently mis-attributing a
// meeting. It gets its own slice.
//
// A note on connection rebinding, because the obvious worry does not apply:
// capture_connection upserts on (workspace, user, provider), so re-authorizing
// a DIFFERENT Google account re-points the same row and `account_bound_at`
// records when. That changes which MAILBOX the row holds — never which human.
// Since class 2 attributes an activity to a user and not to an address, an
// activity captured before a rebind still belongs to the same person, and the
// rebind is irrelevant to it.

// BackfillParticipantsBatch attributes up to limit activities that have no
// participant rows yet, and reports how many it wrote.
//
// It carries no cursor. The selection predicate is "an activity with no
// participant rows from which at least one participant is derivable", and
// every selected activity gains a row, so the remaining set strictly shrinks
// and the caller simply runs it until it returns zero. That makes the job
// resumable and crash-safe for free: there is no position to lose, and a batch
// that dies half-committed is re-selected on the next pass. It also makes the
// pass idempotent, which a cursor would not — a re-run writes nothing new.
//
// The zero-progress guarantee is load-bearing. If the predicate could select
// an activity that yields no rows, the caller's "run until zero" loop would
// never terminate, so the predicate and the insert below are written from the
// same two derivation arms and must stay that way.
