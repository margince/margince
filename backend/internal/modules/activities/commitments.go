// The open-promise read: task activities nobody has ticked off, earliest due
// date first and undated ones last.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT ListActivities WITH TWO MORE FILTERS. The timeline list
// answers "what happened, newest first" and pages on occurred_at. A promise
// is the opposite question in every dimension that matters to the query: it
// is ordered by when it comes DUE, it is bounded to the one kind that has a
// due date, and the rows that matter most are the ones whose date has already
// passed. Bolting an is_done filter onto the timeline would have given the
// right rows in the wrong order behind a cursor that cannot express the
// right one — and would have widened a contract endpoint's vocabulary for a
// caller the contract does not have.
//
// It has an index of its own: idx_activity_tasks is
// (workspace_id, assignee_id, due_at) WHERE kind = 'task' AND is_done =
// false AND archived_at IS NULL — this read's predicate exactly, written
// into core 0008 before anything asked it. It supplies the ORDER too for
// the narrowed sweep, where assignee_id is bound to one owner; the
// workspace-wide sweep matches the partial predicate and then sorts, since
// assignee_id leads the key and id is not in it at all. Both are bounded
// reads, which is what keeps the second affordable.
//
// ONE READ, TWO CALLERS. review_commitments asks it workspace-wide or for
// one owner; prepare_handoff asks it for one project. Both want the same
// rows judged the same way, so there is one derivation rather than two that
// agree until someone changes one.
