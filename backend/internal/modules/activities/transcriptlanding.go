// Three conditions, and each one is load-bearing:
//   - source_system = 'transcript' is the marker the retention selector and
//     the reader both key on. It is what says "this body is a recording of a
//     conversation" rather than notes about one.
//   - a body, because there is nothing to read without one.
//   - created, so an idempotent replay does not queue a second reading of a
//     transcript already read. uq_transcript_read_inflight would refuse it
//     anyway; refusing here means no wasted transaction and no conflict error
//     on a call that did nothing wrong.
//
// A nil enqueue is a legal composition — a deployment with no transcript brain
// wired — and skips silently rather than failing the write. The activity is
// what the caller asked for; the reading is what this installation can offer.
