// it was with, so an account's busiest correspondence carries no organization

// cannot use the predicate at all. Both are the same three arms.
//
// DISTINCT collapses an activity that reaches one account through several arms
// (its own link and its deal's, say) to one row, so a caller counting messages
// is not counting links. An activity that reaches TWO accounts is two rows on
// purpose: whether that is an ambiguity to refuse or a fact to file twice is
// the caller's ruling, not this fragment's.
//
// No entity_type filter: the activity_link_shape CHECK already guarantees
// exactly one of the three id columns is set per row, and the predicate omits
// it for the same reason.
//
// No workspace filter: activity_link, deal and relationship all carry FORCE
// row-level security, and every caller runs inside WithWorkspaceTx.
//
// Known limit, and it matters more to a producer than to a reader: the
// employment arm asks who a contact works for NOW, not who they worked for
// when the message was sent. Mail exchanged with someone at a previous job
// therefore reaches whoever employs them today. A timeline showing it is
// arguably being helpful; a signal FILED against that account is a claim
// nobody made. Bounding the arm by relationship.started_at is the fix, and it
// is not available yet — people.plantEmploymentEdge writes no start date, so
