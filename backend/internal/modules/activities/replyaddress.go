// The deliverable ADDRESS a reply goes to, as distinct from the name it greets.
//
// ReplyRecipientFor beside this answers a NAME, and a name is all a greeting
// needs — an activity with no resolvable person yields an unnamed greeting and
// that is a correct draft. An address cannot degrade the same way: a send with
// no addressee is not a quieter send, it is a message with nowhere to go, so
// this refuses where the greeting shrugs.
//
// It exists because something has to compose a send with no human at the
// keyboard. Every other caller supplies `to` explicitly — the SPA prefills it,
// an agent reads a draft and passes the address back on the send call — but an
// automation drafts and stages in one pass with nobody in the middle to name
// the recipient, and a staged draft that hides who it will go to is not
// something a human can meaningfully approve.

// first would answer with our own address and cheerfully mail ourselves. A
// participant carrying user_id is one of this installation's own people, and is

// Among what remains the rank is the same shape as the greeting's, and for the
// same reason: on an inbound message the sender is who we are answering, and on
// our own outbound the addressee is. Then anyone else who was on it.
//
