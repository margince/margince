// What the slot walk says about its own answer, and how scheduling refuses
// arguments no calendar can serve.
//
// Two properties carry the weight. A capped answer must admit it is capped —
// and must not claim it when nothing was withheld, which is the harder half.
// And a refusal must name a real argument under a code that is true of it.
//
// freeSlots is pure (window in, slots out) and the argument refusals land before
// any query, so none of this needs a database.
