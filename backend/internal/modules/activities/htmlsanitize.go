// What of a caller's markup is allowed onto the wire.
//
// The html_body a caller supplies is transmitted to a recipient's mail client,
// not rendered in our own document, so this is not an XSS defence — a mail
// client is the party that decides what it will run. It is a defence against
// this product being the instrument of something else:
//
//   - A remote image is a read receipt. This product refuses tracking pixels as
//     a stated position (sequences-and-deliverability.md: "the only engagement
//     signal is a real reply"), and a sender who embeds one has collected the
//     signal the product declines to. So no element that loads a remote
//     resource survives — img, script, iframe, object, link, style.
//   - A javascript: or data: href is a payload wearing a link's clothes, and
//     the recipient sees only the text it carries.
//   - A form posts a recipient's answer to whoever the sender named.
//
// The rule is an ALLOWLIST, because the failure of a denylist is silent: an
// element nobody thought of arrives intact, and nothing says so. What survives
// is what a business email needs — emphasis, structure, links, line breaks —
// and everything else is reduced to the text it contained rather than dropped,
// because a sender whose markup vanished still meant the words inside it.
//
// Unwrapping has a consequence worth stating rather than discovering: text a
// sender HID becomes visible. A `hidden` div or a display:none paragraph loses
// the attribute that concealed it and keeps its words, so a message can arrive
// saying more than its author saw in their own composer. That is the honest
// trade — the alternative is silently deleting prose whenever an element is
// unfamiliar — and it is why the drop list holds the elements whose content was
// never message text at all rather than merely being styled out of sight.
