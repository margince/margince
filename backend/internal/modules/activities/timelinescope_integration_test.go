// What the TIMELINE read discloses when it is narrowed to a record the caller
// may not see.
//
// The claim answers successfully when it is broken, which is why it needs a
// database rather than an assertion over the built SQL: the activity scope is
// an ANY-LINK rule, so an activity reachable through one visible record passes
// it, and the narrowing column then filters on a record nobody checked. Delete
// the gate in ListActivitiesTx and this file is the only thing that notices.
//
// The sibling sweep (ListOpenTasks) has carried this gate since it shipped;
// the timeline did not, and widening listActivities' entity_type to admit
// `lead` and `project` is what made the gap reachable for those two arms.
