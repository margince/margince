// A human may say what a document IS. They may not say where it CAME FROM.
//
// The two `*_attachment` values are the library's answer to "where did this come
// from", derived by capture from the message that carried the file. A hand
// upload came from the person uploading it, so asserting either on one mints a
// claim every later reader takes for a derived fact — and unlike a wrong title,
// nothing downstream can tell it from the real thing.
//
// The correction case is the reason this is gated on the ROW and not by narrowing
// the vocabulary: a captured file that landed under the wrong provenance is
// exactly what a patch is for.
