// What a message carries, resolved at the moment it is sent.
//
// The caller names files by id; the send stores a SNAPSHOT of each one's
// metadata (ADR-0086/A131 §4). A pointer would let a later edit rewrite history
// — archive or supersede the document tomorrow and the timeline would change
// what it says a message sent today contained. A snapshot cannot.
//
// Resolution is a READ, and it carries the read's gate: GetAttachmentMeta
// refuses a file whose parent record the sender cannot see, so a rep cannot
// attach a document by guessing its id.
