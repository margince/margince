	// every one of them. The invariant that is missing is a provider-stable
	// one: capture does not persist the provider's own internal message id
	// (Gmail's messages.id, which the receipt already carries as
	// ProviderMessageID), so there is nothing on the captured row that names
	// the transmission it came from. Persisting it is the real fix and it
	// belongs on the capture side; until then the absorb is a strong heuristic
	// held narrow, not a match.
	//
	// A collision that matches none of it is reported rather than absorbed. The

// by. It is also the one thing this path may not decide on its own: a sent

// Dedupe is what makes the timeline honest, so the row is archived rather than

// key it gives up is not needed for de-duplication either — the survivor now
// holds (source_system, source_id), so a later capture of the same message

// only live rows (`activity/` requires archived_at IS NULL), so an archived
// message ages out of nothing — the same standing arrangement the ADR-0072

// does not define ('merge') would file the same disposition under a name
// nothing else in the system reads.
//
// The paired activity.archived goes out for the reason every archive emits one:
// a subscriber was told activity.captured about this row and has no other way
