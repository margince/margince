// Naming who a reply is TO.
//
// A drafter that knows who is sending and not who is receiving greets the only
// name it has, which is the sender's — producing a message addressed to its own
// author. That is not hypothetical: the certification judge floored a draft for
// it, and it is the one defect holding the reply site back from certified.
//
// The name is not on the activity. It is on the person the message was WITH,
// which activity_participant records with the role they held, so this reads the
// participants rather than inventing a second notion of "who this was with".

// drafter with no name — and a draft that opens "Hallo," is correct there,
// where one that guesses is not.

// is read from the message's PARTICIPANTS by role — the sender of an inbound
// message first, then an addressee, then anyone else on it — falling back to the

// real shape this does not model yet; it degrades to greeting the most likely
// counterparty rather than to greeting nobody.
