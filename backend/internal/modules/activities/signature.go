// arrives through a seam compose injects — this module may not import a
// sibling. Nil is a role wired without one, and a role that cannot read a
// signature sends unsigned mail rather than refusing to send: an unsigned
// message is what the product did for its whole life until now, and a rep
// blocked from replying because a settings row could not be read would be the
// worse failure.
