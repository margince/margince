// GetAttachmentExtraction and RequestAttachmentAccess (RD-T10): the staged,
// evidence-or-omit AI-extraction read and the audited "someone wants in"
// courtesy note. Both inherit the attachment's row-scope gate exactly like
// every other attachment op (Store.GetAttachmentMeta) — the same 404 an
// invisible parent or a missing attachment answers everywhere else on this
// surface. The accept-write that persists grounded fields onto a deal is
// compose orchestration (compose/attachment_extraction.go), not here — this
// file only ever reads and audits, never mutates a deal.

// all. The reading itself is compose orchestration behind a 202, because a
// model call takes seconds and can fail and so cannot happen inside the request
// that asks for it.
//
// 404 when this attachment has never been read, which is the honest difference
// between nobody asking and a reading that got nothing. Valid for ANY
// entity_type: a non-deal attachment reads fine, since accepting fields onto a
// deal (not this op) is what is deal-only.
