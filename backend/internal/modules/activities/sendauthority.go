// The request-time send pre-flight: one seam asking "can a send through this
// provider leave at all?", and the two refusals that answer no.
//
// It lives apart from either send path because it belongs to BOTH, and because
// the question is one question: authority over transmission is the delivery
// path's, and this only moves an already-knowable no forward to where the person
// who can fix it is still looking at the screen. The two refusals differ only in
// whose problem it is — the rep's own mailbox, or the workspace's bot.

import "context"

// SendAuthority answers whether this installation can actually transmit through
// a provider for the acting user today. Authority over transmission stays with
// the delivery path, which re-checks the credential at the moment it sends; this
// answers the same question earlier, so the common already-knowable failure
// becomes a refusal the user can act on instead of a 202 followed by a silently
// parked delivery.
//
// It is asked PER PROVIDER because the two transports it serves hold their
// credentials in different places: a mailbox is one human's OAuth grant, while a
// messaging channel is a bot an admin bound for the whole workspace. One seam
// with the provider named is what keeps "may this send leave?" a single question
// — two seams could answer it differently, and the one that wrongly said yes
// would park every message it accepted.

	// It exists because a MAIL send has no `from` argument — the contract takes
	// recipients and a body, never a mailbox — so something has to choose, and
	// for as long as Gmail was the only mail provider that could send, a
	// constant was an honest answer. It stopped being one the day Outlook could:
	// a rep whose only mailbox is Microsoft was refused by a pre-flight asking
	// about a Google connection they never made.
	//
	// The answer is one provider and it is used TWICE — the delivery's provider
	// and the activity's source_system — which is why this returns rather than
	// being asked twice. The provider files its own copy of every sent message
	// back into the mailbox, and that copy is only recognised as this activity
	// when the natural key it carries is the one the send wrote.
