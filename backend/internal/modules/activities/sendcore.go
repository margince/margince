// the resolution — the authorization order, the consent gate, deliverability,

// PreparedSend is one message with every live read already done and every gate
// already passed — rendered, snapshotted, and ready to be written.
//
// It exists because a scheduled send fires from a worker rather than a request,
// and the fire must hold the scheduled row's lock across the same writes an
// immediate send performs (ADR-0104 §3). Splitting preparation from the write
// lets both callers share this one transaction body instead of growing a second
// copy of it that would drift. The approval release is the third such caller:
// approvals.RedeemAndApply owns a transaction, spends the single-use redemption
// in it, and hands the effect that same tx — so a released draft either burns
// its authority AND writes, or does neither.
//
// The two halves are EXPORTED for that third caller, and the boundary between
// them is load-bearing rather than stylistic. PrepareSend reads through the
// STORE, not through a caller's transaction — GetActivity opens its own
// (activity.go) — so running it inside somebody else's transaction acquires a
// SECOND pool connection while the first is held. Under load that is not slow,
// it is stuck: every connection held by a transaction waiting for another.
//
// Its fields stay unexported: a caller outside this package may carry one from
// PrepareSend to SendPreparedTx and may not forge one, so there is no way to
// reach the write half with a message no gate ever saw.
