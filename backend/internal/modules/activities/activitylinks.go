// insertActivityLinks writes the polymorphic link rows. The last_activity_at
// clocks on deal, person and organization move with them, but not from here:
// migration 1787032690 keeps them on the activity_link row itself (a trigger
// recomputing from the timeline), because this is one of several writers of
// that row — capture, ensure, relink and message identity insert links too —
// and the reach set also moves with no link written at all (an employment
// starts or ends, a deal moves account, an activity is archived or re-dated).
//
// The FK alone is not enough: it is
// checked as the table owner, bypassing RLS, so it would accept a
// guessed cross-tenant or out-of-scope UUID as a link target — every
// target passes the row-scope link check first.
//
// A repeated (type, id) is written ONCE. uq_activity_link already says a link
// is one row per record, so a caller that named the same company twice was
// answered with a unique violation — a 500 at the end of a send or a booking,
// and for an agent's approved retry a 500 that consumed the human's one-shot
// approval on a message that then never left. Deduplicating here rather than in
// each caller is what makes that true of every transport at once.
//
// The count is BOUNDED here for the same reason: the list is the caller's to
// choose, every entry costs its own row-scope probe and its own insert, and
// this is the one statement every writer passes through — the timeline's link
// vocabulary describes what a message or meeting is ABOUT, and a record set
// larger than this is about nothing.
//
// A PROJECT link additionally requires activity.UPDATE, which the create grant
// alone does not confer. Filing under a project classifies the correspondence
// as commercial (D5), and that classification is write-once in the database and
// is not lifted by unfiling — so it is a heavier act than creating a row, and
// the capture ladder already refuses it on exactly these terms
// (capture/sinkproject.go: "a principal that may create captured mail but not
// change it attributes nothing"). Two doors onto one act must not disagree
// about who may perform it; before this the create door was the cheaper way in.
