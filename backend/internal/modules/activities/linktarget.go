// holds the id for that arm, and the column that holds the record's
// display name.
//
// The name half is carried HERE rather than beside the one read that
// projects it, so a record type joining the vocabulary cannot be added
// without answering what a human calls it. A struct literal missing a
// field is a compile error; a lookup table somewhere else is a thing to
// forget.

// The TABLE is not carried beside it: each of these record types lives in a
// table named for it, so a second spelling would be nothing but a chance to
// disagree with the first.
