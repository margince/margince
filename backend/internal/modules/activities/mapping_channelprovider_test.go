// The kind and the transport are two axes, and the mapping holds them against
// each other in BOTH directions (ADR-0107/A158): a message names what carried
// it, and nothing else names anything.
//
// Both directions are asserted deliberately. The forward case alone would pass
// just as well if the mapping copied any provider it was handed onto any kind,
// which would put a transport on a note — a row the database then refuses with
// a CHECK the caller cannot see, reported as a 500 rather than as the field
// fault it is.
//
// The predecessor of this file tested the opposite rule: that a caller naming
// `kind: "telegram"` had that read back as a transport. That inference is gone,
// because the caller now has a field to say it in.
