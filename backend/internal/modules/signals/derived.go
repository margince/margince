package signals

// Signals a producer derived rather than a human filed.
//
// The table has carried a `derived` source_channel since 0047 and nothing ever
// wrote one: the only entry point was POST /signals, which is human-only. This
// is the writer, and it stays in THIS module because the module owns the table
// — a producer computes WHICH accounts to raise, and hands the finding here to
// be written.
//
// A derived signal is an OBSERVATION. It is written directly, attributed to the
// producer that drew it, and carries the evidence a reader can open. What
// follows from one — a lifecycle change, a deal, a task — is a structural claim
// and stages for a human instead.
