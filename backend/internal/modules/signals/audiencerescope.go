// A derived signal summarises correspondence, so when a human LIMITS a message
// after the summary was written, the summary's audience has to follow: a
// workspace-visible signal over a limited email is that email's content, read
// by everyone. The activities module emits activity.updated with the audience
// in changed_fields; the compose consumer resolves the capture owner and calls
// here, inside one transaction, to narrow every derived signal whose evidence
// names the activity.
