// Retry safety for a mutating tool call: the same key twice means the effect
// happens once.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A tools/call that times out, or whose transport drops the
// response, leaves the caller unable to tell "it did not happen" from "it
// happened and I did not hear". A model resolves that ambiguity by calling
// again, and for `send_email` the second call is a second email. The key makes
// the honest answer available: the first attempt claims it, and every later
// attempt under the same key is answered from what the first one produced.
//
// WHERE THE CLAIM LIVES. Not here. `compose` already runs an insert-first claim
// over the `idempotency_key` table for the REST transport, with a 24h replay
// window, a digest mismatch refusal and a retention sweep — so this module
// declares the seam and compose adapts its OWN claim transaction to it. One
// claim, one window, one sweep, two doors. The workspace binding and the RLS
// that make the claim tenant-safe are properties of that table, not of either
// caller.
//
// AT MOST ONCE IS THE WHOLE PROMISE, so every branch that cannot keep it
// REFUSES rather than proceeding: no claim store, a claim that errored, a
// result that cannot be recorded. The REST middleware degrades to executing
// when its claim layer hiccups, and that is right for a request whose header
// the client may not even have meant; it is wrong here, where the argument is
// the caller explicitly asking for at-most-once and the act it is asking about
// is irreversible. A surface that cannot promise it says so.
//
// WHAT A REPLAY OWES. Everything a read owes (API-CC-8). A recorded result is a
// receipt that outlives the authority it was produced under, and handing it
// back unchecked would keep paying out records to a caller whose grant, seat or
// ownership has since been pulled — "revocation binds mid-session" would stop
// being true of the retry. The REST middleware answers this with a table of
// routes because a REST body has no common shape; a tool result does, so this
// walks the envelope's own evidence and re-reads every record in it.
