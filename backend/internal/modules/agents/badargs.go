// What a refused tool call says back to the model, and what it may not.
//
// A tool result is read by the model that wrote the arguments, and an agent
// run's transcript is CUMULATIVE — every later prompt of the run carries this
// text. So a refusal here has two obligations the REST twin does not: it must
// name only what the caller authored or what we authored ourselves, never the
// program in between (T2), and the caller-authored half must be bounded and
// escaped, because its author is the same model the text is fed back to.
