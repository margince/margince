// The 2026-07-28 framing, served beside the handshake era (ADR-0092/A141).
//
// A modern request carries its own protocol version, identity and capabilities
// in `_meta`, so it needs no session and could be answered by any replica; a
// legacy request arrives after `initialize` and is parsed exactly as it was
// before. What the two share is everything that decides AUTHORITY: both reach
// the same Registry.Invoke, and nothing in this file touches admission. A
// framing able to alter what a call may do would be a second admission path,
// which ADR-0055 forbids.
//
// This file owns the BODY half of the framing — era detection, the `_meta`
// contract, server/discover, and the members every modern result carries. The
// header half is httpmodern.go, because mirroring belongs to the transport
// that carries the headers.
