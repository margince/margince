// What this server is actually serving, right now, per view.
//
// AVAILABILITY IS PER-URI AND SHARED BY BOTH SURFACES. One immutable snapshot is
// read by resources/list, by resources/read AND by the `_meta.ui` a tool carries
// — because they are one promise. The protocol makes it a MUST that a `ui://`
// URI a tool names exists on the server, and a host is entitled to prefetch a
// view before the tool is ever called, so a tool naming an unheld document is
// not a render that fails: it is a host fetching a 404 and a panel that silently
// never appears. Partial availability works: one view missing suppresses ONE
// tool's `_meta.ui`, and that tool keeps answering in text.
//
// THE ADVERTISED SET FREEZES AFTER Prime, and that is a consequence rather than
// a preference. This server declares `resources.listChanged: false` because
// notifications/*/list_changed travels on a stream this transport does not open,
// so a view that appeared after a background retry would be invisible to any
// host that listed at connect time — a retry loop could not deliver what it
// promised. One bounded attempt at startup, then the set is fixed for the
// process lifetime. An operator restores a missing view by restarting the api,
// which is honest and observable, where a silent never-arriving retry is not.
//
// REFRESH REPLACES ONLY WHAT IS ALREADY HELD. A failed re-fetch, a non-200 or a
// failed re-validation keeps the last known-good copy and alarms. Dropping a
// working view because a rolling deploy served one bad response is the mistake
// this design exists to avoid.
