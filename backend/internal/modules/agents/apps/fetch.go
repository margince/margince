// How the api reads a view document.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT WHAT netguard EXISTS TO STOP. netguard bounds TENANT-supplied
// hosts — "a website URL to read back, a mailbox to capture" — and refuses every
// non-public address for that reason. Here the origin is OPERATOR configuration
// and the path a compile-time constant derived from the catalog, and an operator
// running the api and the web tier on one private network is a legitimate
// deployment that RefusePrivate would break. A reader who finds an unguarded
// client beside a guarded one deserves that sentence, which is why it is here.
//
// The argument holds only while no request input can reach the URL, so Fetch
// takes a CATALOG URI and refuses anything else — there is no spelling of a
// caller-chosen path — and
// TestEveryFetchableURLIsTheConfiguredOriginPlusAConstantPath derives the whole
// reachable set from the catalog and asserts it.
//
// The policy is modelled on internal/platform/webread, which is this tree's
// pattern for an outbound GET, with one deliberate divergence: webread caps
// redirects and re-checks each hop, and this refuses them outright. The bytes
// here become executable UI inside someone's MCP host, and a hop off the
// configured origin is exactly the substitution the whole design is arranged
// against.
