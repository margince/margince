// Package apps serves this surface's interactive views: the documents an MCP
// host fetches by `ui://` URI, sandboxes, and renders beside a tool's answer
// (SEP-1865).
//
// WHY IT IS A SUBPACKAGE. modules/agents grows one only when a named trigger
// fires, and two fire here. This package owns an outbound HTTP client, an
// admission check and an availability state machine — a concern of its own, with
// its own failure modes — and it embeds the shared admission vocabulary, which a
// `go:embed` directive binds to a directory layout.
//
// WHAT A VIEW IS, in this tree's terms: a second RENDERER for an answer a tool
// already gives in text. It owns no data path, holds no credential, and calls
// nothing. Every fact it displays arrived in the tool result the host pushed
// into it, which is why this package has no dependency on a store, a seam, or a
// principal — it composes documents, and the documents are the same for every
// caller.
//
// WHY THE DOCUMENTS ARE SELF-CONTAINED. Each is built with its stylesheet and
// its scripts INLINE, and declares an empty origin allowlist. A host builds its
// content-security policy from that declaration and admits nothing the
// declaration does not name, so "this view reaches no network" is a promise kept
// by having no origin to name rather than by an allowlist someone maintains.
//
// WHERE THE DOCUMENTS COME FROM. They are authored in frontend/src/mcp-apps and
// served by the web tier as one fully-inlined file each; this package FETCHES
// them over HTTP (fetch.go), admits them (validate.go) and holds them (hold.go).
// Nothing here is embedded, which is why availability is a runtime state this
// package has to model rather than a property of the binary.

// EVERY allowlist is left empty on every view, and every permission is unasked

// views: no fetch, no remote script, no nested frame, no camera, no clipboard.
// See the package comment for why an empty list is the promise rather than a
// placeholder.
//
// WHY GEOLOCATION IS ASKED FOR, AND ONLY BY THE PROBE. Reading the device's own
// position is a different act from letting a document reach the network, so it
// is not refused by the same argument the empty allowlists make. But a host maps
// this declaration onto an iframe `allow` attribute, so a card that declares it
// and never calls it is a card that would carry the capability if its code were
// ever substituted. Only geo-probe.html reads a position, so only geo-probe.html
// asks.
//
// The first version of this asked on every view, on the reasoning that the
// position is wanted the moment somebody hands over a business card rather than
// one card later. That is a real product argument and it may come back — but it
// belongs in the diff that makes a product card actually read a position, not
// ahead of one. Least privilege is the default until a view needs otherwise.
//
// WHAT AN EMPTY CSP DOES NOT BUY, stated because the obvious reading is wrong: a
// view still has window.parent.postMessage, which is how the bridge talks to its
// host at all, and no origin allowlist governs it. So a coordinate in a view is
// reachable by the host, and the containment here is that the ONE view holding
// one is a probe that displays it and sends nothing. It is NOT that the sandbox
// makes a coordinate unsendable. See #2619.
//
// A HOST MAY REFUSE, and that is the expected outcome until proven otherwise —
// the extension says hosts "MAY honor these permissions… but are not required
// to". Asking costs nothing when refused: the browser denies the call and the
// view carries on without a position. So no view may treat a coordinate as
// something it will get.
//
// It is one function because the policy reaches a host TWICE — on the catalogue
// and on the read — and those are the two answers that must not be allowed to
// differ. A second literal would be a second chance to widen one of them, which
// is why the per-view part is a parameter rather than a second policy.
