// Package apps serves this surface's interactive views: the documents an MCP
// host fetches by `ui://` URI, sandboxes, and renders beside a tool's answer
// (SEP-1865).
//
// WHY IT IS A SUBPACKAGE. modules/agents grows one only when a named trigger
// fires, and two fire here. This package owns an outbound HTTP client, an
// admission check and an availability state machine — a concern of its own, with
// its own failure modes — and it embeds the shared admission vocabulary, which a
// `go:embed` directive binds to a directory layout.
//
// WHAT A VIEW IS, in this tree's terms: a second RENDERER for an answer a tool
// already gives in text. It owns no data path, holds no credential, and calls
// nothing. Every fact it displays arrived in the tool result the host pushed
// into it, which is why this package has no dependency on a store, a seam, or a
// principal — it composes documents, and the documents are the same for every
// caller.
//
// WHY THE DOCUMENTS ARE SELF-CONTAINED. Each is built with its stylesheet and
// its scripts INLINE, and declares an empty origin allowlist. A host builds its
// content-security policy from that declaration and admits nothing the
// declaration does not name, so "this view reaches no network" is a promise kept
// by having no origin to name rather than by an allowlist someone maintains.
//
// WHERE THE DOCUMENTS COME FROM. They are authored in frontend/src/mcp-apps and
// served by the web tier as one fully-inlined file each; this package FETCHES
// them over HTTP (fetch.go), admits them (validate.go) and holds them (hold.go).
// Nothing here is embedded, which is why availability is a runtime state this
// package has to model rather than a property of the binary.
