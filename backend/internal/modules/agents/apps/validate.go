// The admission check: what this server will and will not serve as a view.
//
// WHAT THIS CHECK IS WORTH, stated plainly, because the reassuring version would
// be false. It is a SUBSTRING RATCHET and corruption detection — not an
// integrity boundary. A computed property (`node['inner'+'HTML']`), an alias, or
// a string assembled at run time walks straight past it, and at run time it can
// equally false-positive on innocent text. What it does catch is the class that
// actually threatens this design: a document that is not the one the build
// produced — a substituted file, a proxy's error page, an ingress serving the
// app shell — because those carry the constructs a real view never has.
//
// THE REAL CONTROLS ARE ELSEWHERE, and each is stronger than this one: the
// build-time PARSED validation in frontend/scripts/vite-inline-views.ts, the
// Playwright zero-request run, TLS and origin discipline on the fetch, and the
// host-enforced content-security policy that SEP-1865 requires. This is defence
// in depth on the seam where the bytes cross a boundary.
//
// IT RUNS THE SAME TOKEN LIST AS THE BUILD CHECK, from the same file, and that
// identity is the point rather than a coincidence: a document that passes the
// build and is refused here would be an outage no lane can see, because the lane
// that builds a document never runs the server that refuses it.
