// The four record-lifecycle commands (margince/margince#928 task 7):
// graduating a lead, retiring one, stepping a project along its phase ladder,
// and moving a deal between stages. Each names ONE routed record and each
// question below rests on that one row — Guards on whether an approval for it
// could ever be released, Subject on the version it pins and the name a human
// reads — so all four ride anchoredRecord (command.go) for a single read.
//
// The vocabulary checks come FIRST in every Guards here, before the read. A
// trigger that is not genuine engagement, a phase that is not a phase, a close
// with no reason: none of them names a record worth a round trip to refuse, and
// each is a refusal the executor makes anyway — reaching it from there instead
// would spend the human's one-shot approval on the way past.
