// The import commands: what an approval of a migrate-in call binds to.
//
// An import run is not a record. It has no owner, no row scope of its own, no
// custom fields — it is a unit of work over the estate, and the estate is what
// the approval is really about. So these commands do not go through the record
// seam the create/patch/archive family uses; they name the run, and the run's
// own report is what the person approving reads.
//
// TWO OPERATIONS REACH HERE and they are asymmetric on purpose.
// createImportRun writes no domain rows (AC-M5), so its approval is a
// formality the tier never asks for — it is registered because the fitness
// test requires every agent-reachable mutating route to decode into something
// that can say what an approval would bind to, and answering "nothing" for a
// route that touches the estate is exactly the gap that test exists to close.
// approveImportRun is the one that writes, and its approval names the run.
