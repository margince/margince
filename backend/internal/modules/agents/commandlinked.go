// The two commands that NAME their records instead of anchoring on one
// (margince/margince#928 task 7): an account-started email, which
// files a brand-new conversation under the records it belongs to, and a
// booking, which says who and what the meeting is about. Neither is handed a
// row, so both have to answer the same three questions about the list they
// were given — is it bounded, is it free of repeats, is every record one the
// caller may actually reach — which toollinks.go answers once for both.
//
// Where they part is the staged TARGET. A booking's first link becomes the
// target and supplies the pin, because a meeting is a commitment ON that
// record. An account-started send stages a CREATE — target type with no id
// and no pin — for a reason its own resolver states.
