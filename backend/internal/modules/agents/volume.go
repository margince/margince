//
// The bound has two halves and they live apart on purpose. platform/auth decides
// admission on them — that is the ONE place a governed action is admitted, and a
// volume budget is an admission term ("scope ∧ tier ∧ volume"). This file is the other
// half: what an answer COSTS, charged where records and effects leave the
// surface. Splitting them is what keeps a registry from being able to admit
// itself.
//
// ONE RULE DECIDES WHAT A FAILED CHARGE DOES: refuse only while nothing has
// happened yet. Everything below follows from it.
