// This is its own file because it is its own concept and it has more than one
// door: the two dynamic MCP tools reach it through their ResolverInput, and the
// REST admission path (ADR-0055 — a passport is a REST Bearer credential,
// governed exactly like MCP) reaches it from compose. Living in tools.go beside
// the CRUD verbs is how it came to be read as "advance_deal's helper" and fixed
// on one door only.

// labelled REOPEN against a version that is already open. One read, one moment,
// and the version pinned to the approval is the one the sentence describes.

// A stage it cannot resolve degrades to naming the destination rather than
// failing: the approval is already the safe answer, and refusing to describe it
