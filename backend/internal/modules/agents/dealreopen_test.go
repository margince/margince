// The defect, written before the fix.
//
// The tier resolver read the TARGET stage's semantic and nothing else, so a move
// ONTO an open stage was auto-execute whatever the deal was before. A won deal
// moved back to Proposal is a reopen: it clears closed_at, the lost reason and
// the FX rate frozen at close, and it takes revenue out of a reported quarter.
// That is the same money and the same irreversibility the 🟡 tier exists for,
// approached from the other end — and it ran ungated.
//
// Every existing test could only supply a target semantic, so all of them passed
// against this.
