// What a 🟡 refusal TELLS the agent, for the two answers the engine can give:
// this call has been staged and needs a human, or a human already answered it
// and the agent is holding the id to spend. An agent given the first line for
// the second case waits for a decision it already has, gives up, and calls
// again — which is how one enrichment collected four approvals.
