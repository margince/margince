// What create_record and update_record accept, per record_type: the shapes the
// two tools are gated on, and the refusal a key outside them earns.
//
// Without them the `fields` argument is an opaque object and the only way to
// learn a name is to guess and read the error: a real session spent three
// round-trips discovering name → display_name for an organization and then
// display_name → full_name for a person, and never did find that a person's
// organization is not a field at all. A tool surface that requires trial and
// error to use is a tool surface that will be used wrongly.
//
// The names are REFLECTED off the generated contract structs rather than
// listed here, because a hand-copied list is a second source of truth that
// drifts the moment crm.yaml changes — and it would drift silently, in a
// description no test reads. internal/contracts is generated from crm.yaml, so
// reflecting off it means the tool refuses exactly what the decoder refuses.
//
// The shapes themselves are PUBLISHED rather than recited into the two tools'
// input schemas — see recordfieldsdoc.go, which renders them as a document and
// says why the tools name it instead of carrying it.

// already establishes that a vocabulary belongs there.
//
// What stays is what a caller needs BEFORE it can decide to go and read: that
// the document exists, and what happens to a key this tool does not know. The
// second half is why the first is safe — rejectUnknownFields refuses by name and
// answers with the whole accepted list, so a caller that writes without reading
// is corrected rather than left to guess again.
//
// It NAMES the document rather than ordering a read, and that difference is
// measured rather than stylistic. Phrased as an instruction — "Read <uri>
// first" — a weak binding obeyed it eagerly: ministral spent its one graded turn
// fetching the vocabulary in scenarios with no write coming at all, including
// ones whose right answer was to stop.
//
// It says a wrong guess is REFUSED, and deliberately does not say how many calls
// recovering takes. Unknown-key and shape validation are separate gates and
// neither reports more than one fault, so two distinct mistakes cost two calls —
// a UAT run proved exactly that. Promising one would be a sentence a caller can
// disprove, which costs more than the silence it replaced.
