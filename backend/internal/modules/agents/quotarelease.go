// The §2.4 ladder from the tool surface's side: what an agent is told, and where
// the question goes, when it crosses a threshold a human can release.
//
// The 🟡 loop next door and this one look alike and are not. A confirm-first
// call asks a human to release ONE act, and the agent redeems that release by
// repeating the identical call with its approval_id. A step-up asks whether this
// agent may CONTINUE, and there is nothing to redeem: approving it widens the
// window, and the agent's next ordinary call succeeds. An agent told to retry
// with an approval_id here would present a token for a kind no tool can redeem.
