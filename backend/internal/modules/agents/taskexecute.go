// What a poll actually does, which is where this extension earns its keep.
//
// A tasks/get is an authenticated request, so when it finds the approval
// released it performs the effect THERE — under the polling passport, through
// the same Registry.Invoke the agent's own retry would take. Admission, object
// RBAC, row scope, the version pin, the volume counters and the retry claim all
// apply because it is the same path, not because this file re-checks them.
//
// Nothing runs between requests, and that is what makes the two obligations
// this track owes structural rather than defended: a cancelled task cannot have
// writes still landing, because no writer exists outside a request; and a
// passport that has been revoked never reaches here, because the transport
// answers its poll with a 401 before dispatch is entered.
//
// WHAT IS EXECUTED IS THE APPROVAL'S PAYLOAD, NOT THE AGENT'S. A human may edit
// a staged proposal before releasing it (ADR-0036 §4), and doing so rewrites
// both proposed_change and diff_hash — "the original hash no longer opens
// anything", in the approvals module's own words. Replaying the arguments the
// agent sent would therefore perform what the agent asked for rather than what
// the person allowed, and would fail redemption for saying so.
