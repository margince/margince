// The App extension on the wire: how a tool advertises its view, how a view
// declares what it may reach, and the ONE place either is rendered.
//
// This is SEP-1865 (extension revision 2026-01-26), which is not part of the
// core protocol revision the transport negotiates — a host opts into it per
// request, and one that does not is served the surface exactly as it was
// before any view existed.
//
// WHY THE RENDERING IS HERE AND NOT AT EACH SURFACE. `_meta.ui` reaches a
// client from two places — a tool in tools/list, a document in
// resources/list and resources/read — and the two halves are one promise: the
// tool names a view, the view states its limits. Rendered where they are
// served, they would be two spellings of one contract, and the failure that
// matters is precisely the one where they disagree.
//
// NOTHING HERE CARRIES AUTHORITY. A view is a second renderer for an answer a
// tool already gives in text. It holds no credential, spends no scope, and
// cannot reach a record its tool would not have answered — which is why none
// of this appears anywhere near the admission gate.
