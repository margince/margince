// `margince://schema/record-fields` — what create_record and update_record
// accept, published as a document rather than carried in their input schemas.
//
// It used to be carried. The two tools rendered every record type's field shape
// plus every advisory into their own `fields` description, and between them that
// was 18% of the whole tool listing — text every client holds on every session,
// and every Surface-B run re-sends on every step, to answer a question one call
// asks once.
//
// Moving it is not the schema deferral the surface rules out. `fields` stays
// {"type":"object"}, byte-identical, and every argument that decides whether a
// call is WELL-FORMED stays in the schema; what moves is the per-type field
// vocabulary, which is what margince://schema/query already publishes for the
// same reason. The move is safe because the refusal path is loud:
// rejectUnknownFields names the offending key AND returns the whole accepted
// list, so a caller that writes without reading this document is told what to
// read, once, rather than guessing twice.
