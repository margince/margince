// The agent allowlist: what a catalog entry may call, and the two doors that
// hold it.
//
// It exists because the SCOPE MODEL cannot express a goal. A passport carries
// scopes, `write` is all-or-nothing across twelve verbs, and an agent that needs
// one of them is handed all twelve — so the catalog entry is the only place that
// can say "this write and no other", because it is the only place that knows
// what the goal is for.
//
// The entry NARROWS and never grants: every call still passes the same
// admission gate against the same passport (ADR-0009 Decision 5 — one registry,
// one audit stream, agent ≤ human). This is a second lock, not a second key.
