// ceiling; a long run cannot silently grow the context). Only the transcript
// gives way to it — the tool listing is in the system prompt and is never
// elided — so it is exported for the composition that knows how large the real
// catalog is to hold that listing against it.
//
// The number is DERIVED from the tightest provider this runner speaks to, not
// chosen. Ollama's num_ctx bounds prompt and completion together, the adapter
// will not ask for more than ollamaMaxContext (32,768) — an uncapped window
// lets whoever wrote a crawled page pick the host's KV-cache allocation — and
// one completion may take perCallOutputCeiling (4,096).
//
// That leaves ONE BUCKET of slack rather than every token arithmetic allows,
// and the slack is the point. Two facts eat into it, and neither is visible
// from here:
//
//   - ollamaWindowFor rounds a request UP by adding a whole bucket, so the
//     largest estimate that is not clamped back to the cap is 32,767, not
//     32,768. Subtracting alone gives a ceiling one token too high.
//   - The adapter's estimate is BIGGER than this package's for the same
//     prompt. estimateTokens counts system + content; contextWindow also
//     counts each message's role, an 8-byte per-message frame, and the
//     response schema in `Format`. A long transcript with a schema is several
//     hundred tokens heavier over there than it looks here.
//
// So the ceiling is the largest value whose worst case still clears the cap:
// 24,576 + 4,096 = 28,672, which rounds to exactly 32,768 and fits, with a
// bucket to absorb what this side cannot count. Trimming that slack to make
// the catalog floor roomier trades a silent truncation — the completion cut
// inside a reasoning model's thinking, which returns well-formed empty content
// and reads as a bad model — for a few more tool descriptions.
//
// It was 24,000, a round number with no derivation at all, and it had stopped
// being only a runner concern: the catalog floor below is a fraction of this,
// and at 24,000 that floor left 63 tokens of headroom for a 67-tool catalog, so
// the next verb anyone added failed a gate that was never meant to ration
// features (margince/margince#3882). Tying the number to ollamaMaxContext is
// what stops it drifting back into a round one.
