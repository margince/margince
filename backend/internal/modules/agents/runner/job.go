// here — it rides the context principal, the same way every other surface
// carries it.

// ceilings, deliberately independent of workspace-level budgets: one
// unattended run can never claim the whole workspace budget (RT-AI-H5).

	// EMPTY MEANS NO NARROWING, and that default is deliberate rather than
	// lazy: the certification lane builds a Job with no spec behind it, and
	// a caller that is not a catalog agent has no allowlist to apply. It is
	// safe HERE because it can only widen back to what the passport already
	// admits — but it is the same "empty means everything" reading
	// AgentSpec.Tools refuses, so the two seams are held to different rules
	// on purpose.
	//
	// The invariant that makes the difference safe is a RUNTIME one, not a
	// property of any test: A JOB BUILT FROM A CATALOG ENTRY CARRIES THAT
	// ENTRY'S OWN ALLOWLIST. A scheduled agent therefore never reaches the
	// empty case; only a caller with no entry behind it does.

	// compose/promptlang and a module may not import compose. Passing a code
	// instead would mean this package rendering its own copy of the rule, which
	// is the second spelling that package exists to prevent.
	//
	// Held by: TestOnlyPromptlangSpellsTheLanguageRule (backend/promptlanguage_test.go)
