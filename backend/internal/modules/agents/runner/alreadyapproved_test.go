// A decision that already exists must not park the run.
//
// A suspended run is woken by the approval.decided event, and for an approval a
// human answered BEFORE this step ran that event has already fired — so parking
// on its id waits for something that will never happen again. The gate now says
// which of the two answers it gave (workflow.StagedApprovalError.AlreadyApproved),
// and this is the run acting on it.
