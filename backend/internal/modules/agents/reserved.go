//
// Two of them today. `approval_id` asserts that a human released this exact
// call (approvals.go), and `idempotency_key` asks that the call be safe to
// repeat (idempotency.go). Neither is part of what a tool DOES, so neither
// reaches its decode — a handler that had to remember to ignore them would be
// thirty handlers that can each forget one.
//
// ONE READING of the caller's bytes decides both, and then the diff_hash. That
// is not tidiness: `encoding/json` matches members case-insensitively and takes
// the last of a duplicate pair while a map lookup does neither, so two
// components reading one wire value by different means eventually disagree —
// the defect class C1 found three instances of. Whatever is popped here is
// popped from the object the digest is then computed over, so there is nothing
// for a second reading to differ about.
//
// BOTH ARE POPPED BEFORE THE HASH, and that ordering is load-bearing for the 🟡
// loop: a refused call is staged under the hash of its arguments, and its
// post-approval retry must hash identically. A retry that added — or dropped —
// a retry key would otherwise present a call the human never approved.
