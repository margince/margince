// crm.yaml's bookMeeting body requires `links`, and this surface advertises it

// documentation, never validation, so the rule holds only where the code puts
// it. It used to stage instead: an approval with no target, which is a human
// asked to release a meeting attached to nothing, with no record to show them
// and no version to pin it against.
//
// The execute door is covered too, because it is reached with an approval
// already redeemed — a call that never passed staging would otherwise book.
