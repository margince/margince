// MCP Tasks (io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks) for the one operation on this
// surface that genuinely waits: a human decision.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A confirm-first (🟡) call is refused and told to come back
// with an approval_id. The agent is never told when — or whether — the person
// decided, so it either gives up on an effect the human released or re-issues
// the call on a guess. A task turns that dead end into a durable handle: the
// call answers with a taskId, and the client polls until the decision lands.
//
// A TASK IS NEVER AUTHORITY, which is the whole reason this shape was chosen
// over a background executor. tasks/get is an authenticated MCP request like
// any other, so when a poll finds the approval approved the effect runs INSIDE
// that poll, under the polling request's own live passport, through the same
// Registry.Invoke every other call takes. Nothing executes between requests.
// That is what makes the two obligations structural rather than defended:
// a cancelled task cannot have writes continuing because nothing is running,
// and a revoked passport stops its own task by failing its own next bind.
//
// The id carries no permission either. Every task method requires the
// presenting passport to match the one the task was created for, and a
// mismatch answers exactly what an unknown id answers.
//
// WHERE THE ROWS LIVE. Not here. This module declares the seam and compose
// implements it over the agent_task table, the same split idempotency.go uses
// — the flat tool-surface package owns no SQL.
