// The contract's account of when advance_deal needs a human must be the
// resolver's account of it.
//
// The two drifted, and nothing noticed for a release. `x-mcp-tool` carries
// `tier_resolver` and `confirmation_required_when` for advance_deal, and NO CODE
// READS EITHER — they are prose in a machine-readable file, which is the most
// reliable way to end up with documentation that contradicts the build. The
// contract went on saying the tier came from the TARGET stage alone long after
// the resolver started reading both endpoints, so a reader implementing against
// the contract would have built an agent that expects a reopen to auto-execute.
//
// So the claim is derived from the resolver rather than compared to a fixture:
// ask advanceDealTier what a reopen actually costs, and hold the contract to
// saying the same thing. A future change to the rule fails here until the
// sentence that describes it moves with it.
