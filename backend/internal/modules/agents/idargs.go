// The claims a tool's schema makes about its uuid arguments, and their
// enforcement — split out of registry.go when that file hit the 500-line cap. The
// boundary is real: registry.go decides WHETHER a call may run (registration,
// admission, staging, redemption), and this decides whether its ids name anything.
//
// It lives beside the registry rather than in a handler because that is the whole
// point. `ids.UUID` refuses a malformed value inside decodeArgs but zero-values an
// ABSENT key without erroring, so a handler receives a well-formed id that names
// nothing, reaches a store lookup, matches no row — and the caller is told a record
// it never mentioned does not exist. Thirteen handlers each failed to make their
// own schema's "required" true, which is what one spelling at one chokepoint is for.
