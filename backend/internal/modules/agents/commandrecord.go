// The two commands one tool serves through TWO contract operations
// (margince/margince#928 task 7): merge_records is mergePerson and
// mergeOrganization, and enrich is scrapeCompany and deepReadCompany. Both are
// where the seam has to carry meaning rather than shape.
//
// A merge is the only command here that names TWO records, and which is which
// is the whole of it — one row survives and one is archived into it. The REST
// route says so in two places at once: POST /v1/people/{id}/merge merges the
// ROUTED person INTO the body's `target_id`, so the routed id is the record
// merged FROM and the approval binds to the survivor named in the body. The
// route walk this seam replaces reads the routed id and gets the wrong half.
//
// An enrich is the same tool at two depths, and the depth is the difference
// between reading one page and crawling a whole site. It is carried as a TYPE
// whose two values each decoder sets STRUCTURALLY — never parsed from a string
// on the REST door — so there is no string for a mistranslation to hide in: a
// descriptor that synthesized "site" for scrapeCompany would satisfy every
// schema and describe a whole-site crawl to a human approving a one-page read.
