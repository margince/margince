// prepare_handoff: everything the delivery side of a project would otherwise
// have to go and ask the seller for, plus a named list of what is still
// missing.
//
// WHAT A HANDOFF OWES, and why this shape. A handoff fails on the things
// nobody wrote down — who owns the work now, who to call at the client, what
// was actually sold, by when, and what was already promised. So the answer is
// those five facts and a GAP for each one that is absent. The gaps are the
// product: a brief that silently omits the owner reads exactly like a brief
// for a project that has one.
//
// EVERY GAP NAMES THE FIELD IT WAS READ OFF, the same discipline
// whats_slipping_this_week applies to a risk claim. A gap nobody can point at
// a field for would be advice, and this tool does not give advice — it
// reports what the records do and do not say.
//
// IT WRITES NOTHING. Handing work over is a decision with its own verb
// (advance_project_phase); a tool that moved the phase while claiming to
// prepare a briefing would be performing the handoff, not preparing it.
