// The one envelope every tool result carries (BYO-RES-1).
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A tool used to answer with a bare payload, so an agent had no
// way to ask the two questions it needs answered about every answer: how do I
// know this, and how current is it? Worse, it could not tell "no records
// matched" from "records matched and you may not see them" — the one confusion
// that produces a WRONG answer rather than a thin one, because the agent then
// tells a person a record does not exist when it does.
//
// NONE OF THE SIX FIELDS IS NEW INFORMATION. Each reports something the call
// already computed and then discarded: the correlation id the HTTP layer mints
// per request, the freshness the datasource seam already populates, the trust
// label the seam already carries, the records the handler already read. That is
// what makes this half ratifiable now (A138) — it reports, it does not judge.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. `coverage` and `omitted_sections` (BYO-RES-3).
// Both are evaluative — judgements the system must MAKE rather than facts it
// holds — and both are one-way doors: the moment a client branches on
// `complete_exact`, that word is frozen for every surface that comes after. They
// ship with the surface that first produces them, and until then a result says
// what it found and what it warned about, and claims nothing about
// exhaustiveness. TestNoResultSchemaCarriesADeferredEnvelopeField holds that.
