// The resolve_entities tool (🟢): the question every capture flow has to answer
// before it can propose anything — do these names, addresses and numbers
// already name records here?
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A SEARCH. Search matches text and ranks it. Identity is decided
// by keys: a shared address, a phone number, an established channel binding, a
// company domain. The two give different answers to the same string, and only
// one of them can be acted on — a caller that creates a person because a search
// found nothing has created the duplicate this tool exists to prevent.
//
// IT DECIDES NOTHING AND MERGES NOBODY. A near-match is a comparison a person
// makes, and this answers `ambiguous` however high the score. Merging stays 🟡
// and goes through merge_records, with a human in it.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL OWNS is the same half query_workspace owns: the resolver
// answers ids over a workspace-wide ladder, and every one of them is READ BACK
// through the datasource seam before it reaches the caller. That is where this
// caller's own object RBAC and row scope are applied, where the trust tier is
// stamped, and where the record is charged against MCP-SESS-READS.
