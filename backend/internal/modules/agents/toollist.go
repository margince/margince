// dispatching answer different questions. This decides what a client is told
// exists; the gate decides what it may do. The two must agree without being the

// that lies, and the client's only way to learn the truth is to call and be

// Registry.Offered is its only caller, and every narrowing of the TOOL catalog
// goes through there — the external tools/list and the tool listing a Surface-B

// The resources catalogue is the one sibling that does not: readableByCaller
// spells the same three branches over mcp.Resource. One rule, two spellings,
// because neither type carries the other's fields — which is a real cost, not a
// tidy separation. A third surface needing this rule should lift the predicate
// rather than copy it a third time.
//
// It answers the SCOPE axis only, which is what §5.7 promises. The seat
// ceiling and object RBAC are re-derived per call through the authority seam
// and are a named follow-up (§10.2); this filter must not pretend to enforce
// them, and Registry.Invoke remains the authority for every one of them.
