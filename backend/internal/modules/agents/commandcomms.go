// The two anchored sends: a mail reply and a channel reply
// (margince/margince#928 task 7). Both answer a conversation that
// already exists, so both name an ANCHOR activity — the row the effect hangs
// off, whose version the approval pins and whose authority decides whether an
// approval could ever be released at all.
//
// These are the first commands BOTH doors reach for the same operation: the
// tool decodes send_email/send_message arguments into them, and the REST door
// decodes POST /v1/activities/{id}/send-email and .../send-message into the
// same commands. Every refusal below therefore stops being a rule the tool door
// makes and the REST door skips, which is what #928 is about.

// ChannelKinds answers whether an activity kind is a messaging-channel
// conversation a reply may transmit through.
//
// It is the Comms seam's own question narrowed to the two methods this
// resolver needs (Comms embeds them below), because the REST door reaches the
// resolver without the send machinery around it: that door has no reason to
// hold a seam that can send mail, book meetings and read calendars in order to
// ask whether an anchor is a channel. Both answers come from the activities
// package either way, so the two DOORS cannot come to disagree.
//
// They are a PRE-STAGING guard, not a restatement of the store's own refusal.
// The store refuses a send it cannot make by asking whether the workspace has a
// bot bound (channelsend.go's canSend); this asks whether the installation
// composed the transport at all, which is knowable earlier and is the question
// worth answering before an approval is spent.
//
// It asks TWO questions since ADR-0107/A158, because one no longer implies the
// other: whether the anchor is a channel conversation at all, and whether this
// installation composed a transport that can carry a reply on the provider it
// names. Before the split, a kind that was a channel WAS a provider this
