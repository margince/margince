// A tier the CONTRACT tightens for ONE record type, made visible to the tool door.
//
// ADR-0026's tighten-only floor is declared per contract OPERATION — `createProject`
// is confirm-first where `createPerson` is not — while a tool's tier is declared per
// VERB. The REST door resolves the operation and sees the tightening; this door
// resolves `create_record` and could not, so the write a route staged for a human
// ran unattended through the verb that performs it (#982).
//
// The floor asks the question the contract already answers: for THIS call's
// (verb, record_type), what is the tightest tier any operation declares? The answer
// is derived from the generated policy table at the composition root, so the
// contract stays the one source and a new annotation cannot bind one door only.

// answering for one mistake.

// ServesRecordType is the other half, and it is what keeps the floor from making
