// The query_workspace tool (SEARCH-PARAM-7, 🟢): a question with STRUCTURE —
// conditions, a hop, a likeness — compiled to a closed vocabulary, executed,
// and answered with what kind of answer it is.
//
// The plan grammar and its executor live in the search module, which this
// package may not import (ADR-0054 §3), so the composition root injects the
// whole compile-validate-execute path as one function. That is deliberate
// beyond the import rule: the vocabulary is DERIVED per caller from the field
// catalog and the live column catalog, so there is nothing about it this
// package could usefully hold.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL OWNS is the half the executor cannot: turning the refs it
// answers into records, through the same seam every other read on this surface
// uses. That is where the trust tier is stamped, where the result envelope's
// freshness and evidence are collected, where the caller's object RBAC and row
// scope are applied to the record itself, and where the read is COUNTED against
// MCP-SESS-READS — so a query answering twenty-five rows spends twenty-five of
// the caller's records, not one. A densely-joined answer is the cheapest bulk
// read on a surface that charges per call (A139), and this is the densest read
// the surface has.
