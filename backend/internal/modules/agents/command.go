// The two doors used to decide independently what a call was about: the tool
// door asked the tool, and the REST door GUESSED — the route's {id} parameter
// paired with the operation's declared record type. A guess and a fact cannot
// be held in agreement by review, and these two drifted repeatedly.
//
// What the doors share here is not the tool's arguments: half the REST
// operations have no expressible tool call, and hashing a projection of a
// request while executing the raw request lets an operand drift between them.
// It is a typed COMMAND — the operation's own vocabulary, where a path operand
// is a field like any other — and one resolver over it.
