// The read_brief tool (BYO-TOOL-22, 🟢): the morning brief, readable.
//
// A139 settled the question this closes. Every input to the brief — the deals,
// their activities, the relationships behind them — was already agent-readable,
// so withholding the ASSEMBLED answer while granting all of its parts "is a
// distinction the surface cannot honestly explain". The queue itself stays a
// human surface: acting, dismissing and snoozing an item are how a person
// notices what an agent did, and an agent that curates that queue is reviewing
// itself.
//
// WHOSE BRIEF IT IS. The brief is a personal lens, resolved through the acting
// principal's own user id — and a passport carries the granting human's
// (identity mints it as OnBehalfOf). So an agent reads the brief of the person
// it acts for, never a shared one and never another rep's, and that follows
// from the principal rather than from anything this tool does.
//
// WHY THE METERING IS EXPLICIT HERE. Brief items are contract types, not
// datasource.Records, so they do not ride newWireRecord and NOTHING charges for
// them by default. Metered per call, a densely-joined brief would be the
// cheapest bulk read on a surface that charges per record — the exact failure
// A139 names — so this tool charges one read per item it hands over.

// It never ranks. The contract is explicit that the read re-reads the
// read-model and the home route never blocks on assembly (B-E05.3b), and an
// agent asking what the queue says must not be the thing that changes it.
//
// ONE thing behind this read does write, and it is worth stating rather than
// discovering: the engine resolves snoozes as it reads, so an item whose snooze
// has expired flips back to actionable in the read's own transaction (A77). It
// is the same entry point the human's own home route calls, the flip is decided
// by the clock rather than by the caller, and reading twice changes nothing the
// first read did not — but it does mean an agent's read can be what materializes
// a state the person then sees.
