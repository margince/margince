// Pipeline and stage discovery: the read that makes the deal-shaped write
// verbs usable at all.
//
// `create_record` for a deal REQUIRES pipeline_id and stage_id, and
// `advance_deal` requires to_stage_id — and until this tool existed no verb on
// the surface yielded one. A correct refusal into a dead end is still a dead
// end: an agent was told exactly which two ids it needed and had no way to
// obtain either.
//
// ONE tool, stages nested, not a list-pipelines plus a list-stages: a stage is
// meaningless without the pipeline that owns it, and two tools would force a
// join an agent has no reason to perform. 🟢 — it reads configuration and
// changes nothing.
