// The claims a tool's schema makes about its NUMERIC arguments, and their
// enforcement — the sibling of idargs.go, at the same chokepoint and for the
// same reason: the bounds are read off the schema once at registration and held
// at Registry.Invoke, so what tools/list advertises is true of the SURFACE
// rather than of whichever handlers remembered to check.
//
// A `minimum`/`maximum` is not decoration. It is the only thing a client has to
// size a call by, and a server that advertises `maximum: 50` while serving
// 999999 teaches the next caller that the rest of the schema is advisory too —
// after which every other declared claim has to be re-discovered by experiment.
// decodeArgs already refuses a value of the wrong TYPE for these fields and any
// argument the schema does not declare; the advertised RANGE was the one claim
// with nothing behind it.
//
// Scope: top-level integer/number properties. `maxItems` on an array is a
// different claim about a different thing — the cost of the reads that array
// buys — and is held where that cost is paid (bookingLinks).
