// It exists because the model is asked for a value this module cannot enumerate
// for it: `log_activity` requires a `channel_provider` when the kind is
// `message`, and which providers exist is a DEPLOYMENT fact, so no generated
// enum can carry it into the tool schema. Without this the schema could only
// describe the rule in prose and leave the model guessing at the vocabulary —
// and a guessed provider fails a foreign key it has no way to anticipate.
