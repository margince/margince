// Derived coverage for the staging refusal (review-loop rule 2). Pinning the
// predicate alone cannot hold the invariant: refuseStagingElsewhere has to be
// CALLED by every tool that stages, and a per-site spec only ever covers the
// sites someone remembered. So this enumerates the core registry's
// StageInfo-shaped tools and requires each to refuse a target whose authority
// lives elsewhere — one with no args entry fails here, and one that forgets the
// guard fails here too.
//
// Two tools answer a DIFFERENT question here, and both are walked rather than
// excused:
//   - update_record stages twice over. Its per-field residue goes through
//     stageConflicts, which this walk cannot see —
//     TestUpdateRecordRefusesStagingForATargetHeldElsewhere is that path's pin.
//     Its StageInfo is the whole-call staging the contract's per-record-type
//     tier floor produces (#982), and that one IS walked here, because it reads
//     the record it patches exactly as its 🟡 siblings do.
//   - create_record stages a CREATE, which names no existing record, so there is
//     no target whose system of record could be elsewhere and nothing for
//     refuseStagingElsewhere to be called about. It is held to the invariant it
//     does have — stagesACreate below — rather than dropped from the count, so a
//     create that began inventing a target still fails something.
//
// One boundary this walk does NOT cover, stated so it does not read as covered:
//   - the walk builds only RegisterCoreTools and RegisterCommsTools. Every
//     stageable tool lives in one of the two today; one registered by a third
//     family would escape, which is what the count assertion below is for — it
//     changes the moment either set does.
