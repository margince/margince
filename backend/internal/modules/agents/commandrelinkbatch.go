// The two batch relinks, as commands both doors resolve. They are the single
// relink at scale: the same destination question decides the tier
// (destinationTieredCall), the same vocabulary guards the destination
// (requireLinkTarget), and the owning store performs the same guarded write
// per row.
//
// What a staged card BINDS TO differs from the single form, and on purpose.
// The single relink binds to the activity it moves. A batch names many rows,
// and no one of them is the decision: the decision is the DESTINATION — every
// card this family stages is "file these under THAT project", so the approval
// targets the project, and deciding it takes the project's read floor and row
// scope exactly as advance_project_phase's card does. A card targeting nothing
// would be decidable by anyone holding activity.update over rows they cannot
// write, which is the authority the per-row write check exists to withhold.
//
// And what a card COVERS must be exact. An approval is redeemed by retrying the
// identical call, so the rows a human released are the rows that call names.
// A named set names them; a thread key does not — it is re-read at redemption,
// and a message joining the conversation in between would be filed and stamped
// under an approval that never described it. So the thread form NEVER stages:
// a destination that needs a human is refused with the instruction to name the
// set through relink_activities, whose diff hash binds the ids verbatim.
