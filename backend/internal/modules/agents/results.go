// What every tool answers with, as a type.
//
// WHY THESE EXIST. A tool's result used to be a `map[string]any` literal built at
// the return statement, and its advertised OutputSchema was `{"type":"object"}` —
// the only schema a map can honestly claim. The two halves of that agreement were
// never held together by anything: a key could be renamed, added or dropped and
// no gate would notice, because the schema said nothing to contradict.
//
// A named type fixes both halves at once. It is what the handler marshals, so the
// wire shape is the type's; and outputshapes.go derives the declared schema from
// the same type, so the schema is the type's too. Neither can move without the
// other.
//
// TWO TYPES HERE MARSHAL NOTHING, and that is deliberate rather than dead:
// PassthroughEntityResult and RunReportResult describe results another module
// builds. This surface must not re-marshal those — doing
// so would drop whatever the producing entity carries and silently move the
// wire — so the type exists to DECLARE the guaranteed subset, and the
// conformance suite in the integration lane holds each one to what the real
// handler answers with. A declaration nothing checked would be the comment this
// whole change is replacing.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE. The shape of a RESULT, and nothing else. These types carry
// no behaviour: they are the wire, written down. A field's json tag is the wire
// name, `omitempty` means genuinely optional, and a pointer means the value can
// be absent rather than zero — all three are read by the generator, so they are
// statements about the contract rather than about Go.
//
// WHERE THE REST ARE. Types that already existed keep their homes, because they
// are already the shape of the thing they name: `wireRecord` (tools.go, the ONE
// place a datasource.Record becomes tool output), `Pipeline`/`Stage`
// (tools_pipelines.go), and the relationship-graph answers (tools_network.go).
// The generator reads all of them; this file is only where the ones that had no
// type until now came to live.
