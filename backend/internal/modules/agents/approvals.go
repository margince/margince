// pinForWrite answers the version a write must be conditioned on, from the

// the caller's if_version straight through, so a redeemed retry there is not
// carried by the released pin the way the REST door's If-Match forward carries
// it. That asymmetry predates this function and is filed, not implied away.
//
// The CALLER's pin wins when it supplied one: it is bound into the diff_hash the
// redemption verified, so it cannot disagree with what the human approved. It
// may not disagree with what the GATE read either, and that is CHECKED rather
// than assumed. The caller controls this argument, so a version the gate never
// saw is a version nothing proved — and a caller naming the version the racing
// close will PRODUCE walks straight through the guard, because the store's
// compare then passes on precisely the record the tier decision does not
// describe. A disagreement answers skew rather than being silently overridden,
// so a caller holding a stale version still learns that it is stale.
//
// The RELEASED pin comes next. Redemption commits its OWN transaction and the
// handler then opens a fresh one, so the skew check inside the redemption proves
// the row was at the approved version when the approval was consumed — not that
// it still is when the effect lands, and the agent controls both sides of that
// window (its own 🟢 update_record can commit in between). Carrying the pin into
// the write moves the version compare inside the transaction that actually
// mutates.
//
// The ADMITTED pin closes the same window on the auto-execute path, where there
// is no approval to carry one. A dynamic tier is resolved by READING the record
// — a deal move runs unattended only when the gate can prove BOTH endpoints of
// the move open — and that read commits before the write just as a redemption
// does. Without it a close landing in the window reopens a won deal at the 🟢
// tier: the same race, one tier down.
//
// The REST gate does the same thing by forwarding the pin as If-Match
// (compose/agentgate.go); this is that fix on the MCP transport.
