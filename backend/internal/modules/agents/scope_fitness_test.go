// Passport-scope coverage as a fitness function. A leaked or over-broad
// passport's blast radius is exactly the set of tools its scopes admit, so
// the mapping tool→scope is a security surface. Two invariants, derived from
// the registered surface so a new tool cannot quietly break them:
//   - every tool requires a scope from the closed passport vocabulary; and
//   - outbound egress (send_email, book_meeting) is gated on the dedicated
//     `send` scope, never plain `write` — so a passport can edit records yet
//     be barred from sending mail.
