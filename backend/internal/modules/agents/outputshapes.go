// The declared shape of every tool result, derived from the Go type the handler
// marshals.
//
// WHY DERIVED AND NOT GENERATED INTO A FILE. A generated file needs a drift gate
// to stop a hand edit, and the gate exists because the file CAN disagree with
// the type. Reading the type at registration removes the disagreement instead of
// policing it: there is one statement of the shape, and the schema is a view of
// it. What a generated file would have bought — schemas a reviewer can read in a
// diff — is bought instead by a golden snapshot test, which renders every schema
// to a committed file and fails when one moves without the change being looked
// at.
//
// This also settles where the generator could have lived. `backend/tools` is its
// own module and cannot import `backend/internal/...`, so a reflecting generator
// would have had to parse the AST and re-implement Go's own type resolution —
// for types that are right here.
//
// WHAT A SCHEMA CLAIMS. `additionalProperties` is deliberately NOT set, so every
// schema reads "at least these fields". That is the honest claim for two
// different reasons at once: a result carrying a field this build does not know
// is not a violation a client should reject, and — for the tools whose handler
// passes another module's entity straight through (PassthroughEntityResult,
// AvailabilityResult, RunReportResult) — the declared fields really are a
// subset by construction.
