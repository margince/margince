// Whether a result keeps the promise its tool advertised.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A declared schema nothing checks is a comment. The
// surface now tells a client the exact shape of every result, and the only thing
// that can make that true at runtime is reading the result against it — at the
// one place a real result and its declared schema are both in hand.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The subset of JSON Schema
// this surface EMITS: types, required members, array items, and a map's value
// shape. Not `format`, not `enum`, not `minimum` — nothing that would need a
// full validator. That is a deliberate line: this is a self-check on output this
// server produced, so it exists to catch a handler and a schema that have parted
// company, not to police a payload from outside. A general validator would be a
// dependency and a second, larger thing to be right about.
//
// It answers a DEFECT STRING rather than an error because the caller logs it and
// carries on with the text block: the defect is ours, not the caller's, and the
// message has to name where in the document it is or a reader cannot find it.
