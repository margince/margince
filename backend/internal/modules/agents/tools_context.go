// The search_context tool (🟢): the retrieval primitive underneath the intent
// tools, exposed for the first time.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. search_records matches the text ON a record and answers
// records; query_workspace answers a plan with structure. Neither answers "find
// me the material about X" — the ranked, meaning-first sweep whose result is a
// record AND the excerpt that made it rank. That is what the hybrid arm has
// always done for catch_me_up_on's grounding, and what no caller could ask for
// directly.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL OWNS is the half the retriever cannot: turning its refs into
// records through the same seam every other read on this surface uses. That is
// where the trust tier is stamped, where the envelope's freshness and evidence
// are collected, where this caller's object RBAC and row scope are applied to
// the record itself, and where the read is COUNTED against MCP-SESS-READS. A
// ranked sweep is a bulk read (A139) and is charged like one — per record, not
// per call.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHICH LANE RANKED IT. Hybrid retrieval has two lanes and can lose
// the vector one — no bound embed model, or an embed call that failed. The hits
// still come back, and calling that page semantic would be the quietest wrong
// answer on this surface: a caller asking for likeness would read a word-overlap
// list as a meaning-ranked one, and nothing about it looks wrong.

// is the chassis's request-body limit, which is megabytes. A thousand runes is

// message bodies and call notes are not searched. A surface that advertises five
