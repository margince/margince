// The MCP method dispatcher: the protocol subset a tools-only server needs —
// tools/list, tools/call, ping, the resource reads, and each era's own opening
// call — with every call routed through the Registry, which means through the
// admission gate. Tool failures travel IN-BAND as isError results (the agent
// should read them and adapt); only malformed JSON-RPC is a protocol error.
//
// It answers TWO framings, and the difference between them stops at parsing
// and rendering: modern.go decides which era a request is in and what its
// answer carries, while every arm below reaches records through the one
// registry. A framing able to alter what a call may do would be a second
// admission path, which ADR-0055 forbids.
//
// It owns no transport. httpmcp.go builds one of these per handler and feeds
// it decoded requests, so method dispatch, the tool surface and the
// scrubbed-error rules are defined once rather than per transport. A second
// transport, should one return, gets the same object and therefore cannot
// answer a call differently.
