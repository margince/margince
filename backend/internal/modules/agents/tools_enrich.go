// enrich (EP05 / ADR-0006): read a company's own website and PROPOSE what it
// says about them. It is the one tool that reaches outside the workspace to
// fetch rather than to deliver, which is why it spends the `enrich` cap and not
// `write` — a granting human who withheld `enrich` withheld exactly this.
//
// Nothing is written to the organization here. The proposal carries per-field
// evidence and lands in the approvals inbox; a human accepting it fills only
// EMPTY fields and never overwrites a human-set value. Two approvals are in
// play and they are not the same one: the transport gate stages the CALL
// (confirm-first, because the fetch spends budget and leaves the workspace),
// and the engine stages the PROPOSAL a human then accepts.
//
// The evidence gate is the engine's, not this tool's: every returned field
// carries a non-empty snippet + source_url + confidence or it is absent. A tool
// that re-derived that rule would be a second answer to it.

// EnrichDepth is how much of the site a call reads. Its two values are two
// contract operations behind one verb, so the argument is what chooses between
// them rather than the client picking a route.
//
// A named type rather than a bare string, because the two doors reach this
// vocabulary from opposite directions: the tool parses one of two words out of
// its arguments, and the REST door has no word at all — its two routes ARE the
// two depths, so its decoders set the value structurally (commandrecord.go).
// A string would let the second of those be spelled wrong in a way every
// schema accepts (margince/margince#928 task 7).
//
// EXPORTED because the implementation of CompanyEnricher lives in the
// composition layer and routes on it — a second spelling there would silently
// send a site read to the one-page path.

// and answers with the proposal, EnrichDepthSite queues a multi-page crawl and
// answers with the read's id and queue state, and EnrichDepthTechnical queues
// the public-records lookup and answers the same way.
//
// Technical is a depth of this verb rather than a verb of its own because a
// granting human deciding "may this agent make the product go and read about a
// company?" is deciding one thing, and `enrich` is the cap that answers it. It
// reads DIFFERENT sources — DNS, certificate logs, one homepage fingerprint —
