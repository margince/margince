// The three questions a confirm-first archive asks the ROUTED executor, and
// what each one answered before it could.
//
// GovernanceResolver's own doc promises that Guards "refuses, BEFORE anything
// is staged, what the executor would refuse afterwards — so a human's one-shot
// approval is never spent on a call that was never going to run." These pin
// that promise against an executor that is deliberately NOT the one the caller
// would have assumed: a provider archiving three types where native archives
// six, refusing a row the caller can read, and recording the version it was
// handed.
