// `margince://capabilities` — what this installation lets THIS caller do,
// published so a client does not have to buy the tool listing to find out.
//
// The cost it answers is measured, not supposed. The listing is ~12,700 tokens
// across 37 tools, and 98% of that is input schemas (54%) and descriptions
// (44%) — the parts a client needs to CALL a tool, and exactly the parts it does
// not need to decide whether this server is worth calling at all. A fresh
// session asking "what is this?" pays for all of it.
//
// So this document carries the catalog's SHAPE and not its weight: the verbs by
// name, which of them execute and which stage for a human, and the scopes this
// passport actually holds. Names are cheap — every tool name on the surface is
// under a kilobyte together.
//
// It is DERIVED per caller, never a written summary kept beside the registry: a
// summary drifts the first time a tool is added and nothing notices, and a
// capabilities document that overstates the surface is worse than none, because
// a client believes it.
