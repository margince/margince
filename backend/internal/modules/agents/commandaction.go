// The remaining four confirm-first commands the tool schema cannot express
// (margince/margince#928 task 5): retiring a custom field (no body
// at all), replacing a picklist's option set, and attaching or detaching a
// project stakeholder. None of them is a whole-record field patch, so none
// of them belongs in command.go's patchResolver — but two of the four
// (retire, options) target `custom_field`, a type the record seam has never
// served (command.go's servedByTheRecordSeam), while the other two target
// `project`, which it serves like any other record. routedRecordTarget
// (command.go) carries that distinction for all four rather than each
// resolver restating it.
