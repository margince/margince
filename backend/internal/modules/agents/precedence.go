// The per-field human-edit-precedence split (interfaces.md §2.1):
// update_record is 🟢, but an agent never silently undoes a person.
// When an auto-execute patch touches fields whose CURRENT value a human last
// wrote, exactly those fields are split off into a 🟡 staged approval
// while the remainder of the patch proceeds at the auto-execute tier in the same call.
// This file is the ONE spelling of that partition — the MCP tool and
// the REST agent gate both split through it, so the two transports
// cannot drift on which fields a human decision protects.
