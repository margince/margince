//
// They exist in the MODERN framing only, and that is a statement about the
// protocol rather than a restriction: the capability admitting them is a
// per-request `_meta` member, and the handshake era has no place to carry one.
// A legacy client asking for tasks/get is asking for a method that, in its era,
// does not exist — which is what -32601 says.
//
// Execution lives next door in taskexecute.go. The boundary is the same one
// dispatch.go and explain.go keep: this file decides what a client is TOLD, and
// that one decides what actually happens when a poll finds a released approval.
