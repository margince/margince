// The defect, written before the fix.
//
// #610 made the tier turn on BOTH endpoints, so a move that reopens a closed
// deal raises to confirm-first. It proves both endpoints open from a read that
// commits before the write does, and on the auto-execute path nothing binds the
// two: the deal can close in the window, and the 🟢 write then lands on a
// terminal deal — clearing closed_at, the lost reason and the FX rate frozen at
// close, with no human in the loop.
//
// The interleaving is what has to be tested, so the racing close happens at the
// one moment that reproduces it: inside the tier gate's own read. The provider
// below supplies the TIMING and nothing else — the version compare it then
// applies is the one deals.Store.AdvanceDeal applies through ApplyGuarded, and
// the integration lane drives that same sequence against real Postgres.

// closesUnderneath is a deal that a concurrent actor closes during the tier
// gate's read: the FIRST read answers the deal as the gate must see it (open,
// at the version it then holds) and, on its way out, moves the row to won and
// bumps the version. Every later read sees the closed deal, which is what the
// racing actor left behind.
