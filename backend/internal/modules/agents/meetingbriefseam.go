// The pre-meeting brief, as the agent surface reads it.
//
// There were two answers to "prepare me for this meeting", and the agent got
// the weaker one. A person opened eight cited sections — goal, attendees,
// commitments, risks, and the rest — while an agent asking the same question
// got the assembled context walk with its open tasks pulled to the front, from
// a code path that shares nothing with the brief. Both were individually
// reasonable, which is exactly why nobody noticed they disagreed.
//
// The brief lives in compose and a module may not import compose (ADR-0054
// §3), so what crosses is one function, bound in compose/meetingbriefseam.go.
// That is the sanctioned shape for this edge and the reason to take it rather
// than reimplement: a second assembler is what produced the split.
