	Purpose: "Find out whether the people and companies named in something you are holding already " +
		"exist here, matched on addresses, phone numbers and company domains rather than on text.",
	Limits: "It reads only. Nothing is created, changed or merged, and it answers person and " +
		"organization, never leads. A near match comes back `ambiguous` however close it is.",
	Instead: "Use search_records to find a record you know exists, and merge_records once a person " +
		"has decided that two records are one.",
	Retain: "Call this BEFORE creating a person or company from anything you did not type. Act on " +
		"`matched`; on `ambiguous` ask which is meant; on `unresolved` say what you will create — " +
		"a miss is not proof nothing exists.",
}
