// The channel_connection reads and writes the getUpdates poller works through
// (design v2 §3). Ingress pulls rather than being pushed, so nothing carries a
// tenant into this path: the dispatcher enumerates the fleet the way the Gmail
// push walk does (push.go), and every per-connection step runs under the
// workspace the enumeration resolved.
//
// The offset write is the load-bearing one. getUpdates(offset = poll_offset) is
// ALSO Telegram's acknowledgement of everything below that number, so the
// advance is exposed as a Tx call and nothing else: its caller commits it in the
// same transaction that made the batch durable, and there is deliberately no
// pool-level variant that could be spent on its own.

//     Telegram would be told to forget every message it is holding and the
//     connection would go permanently deaf while still reading `connected`. Zero
//     rows matched is the correct outcome: the raw rows this transaction wrote are

//     updates this installation has captured.
