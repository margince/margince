// Package capture owns inbound capture (interfaces.md §1): the ONE
// connector.Sink implementation — a connector normalizes provider
// records, capture writes them. One transaction per record: raw
// original + domain row + audit entry (connector principal, never
// forgeable) + the captured event through the outbox, idempotent on
// the (source_system, source_id) natural key so replays are free.
//
// The registry holds the compiled-in connector set and enforces the
// grant-time scope intersection: a connector's declared scopes must be
// ⊆ the granting human's — connector ≤ human, exactly like agents.
//
// Tables owned: raw_capture, capture_connection, capture_trace (the
// 24-hour diagnostic trace of what the pipeline decided about each
// message, swept rather than retained), capture_exclusion (the addresses
// and domains the sink refuses before any write), capture_owner_identity
// (a seat's OTHER addresses, so mail among a person's own addresses is
// not read as correspondence and an alias is never minted as a contact).
// Imports shared + platform only; never a sibling module.
