package capture

// The capture module's own settings declarations (ADR-0090/A135). Capture
// owns these: it supplies the type, default, validator, RBAC object and audit
// verb, and platform/settings runs them without knowing what enrichment is.
//
// AutoEnrich moved here from a `capture_auto_enrich` column on the workspace
// row (0121). The governance is deliberately unchanged — same
// `capture_settings` object, same audit-only posture (EVT-NOEVT-3: the closed
// event catalog defines no capture-settings verb) — because this is a change
// of where the value lives, not of who may change it.

// surface: every role reads it (a rep needs to see whether auto-enrich is
// live), only admin/ops writes.

// SettingsObject is the same object, for compose.
//
// Exported because the Google-app transport has to take the gate BEFORE it can
// see whether the store exists — a wiring check that answers first turns the
// status code into an oracle for whether this installation has a vault. The
// unexported spelling stays the one this package uses, so there is one value
// rather than two that happen to agree.

// AutoEnrich is the captured-organization auto-enrich posture (CAP-PARAM-7,

//
// Default true preserves 0121's column default, so an installation that never
// touched the toggle sees no behaviour change across the move.
//
// One thing the move DID change: the audit row's before/after field is now
// keyed `capture.auto_enrich` where the column form wrote `auto_enrich`. The
// verb, object and actor are unchanged, but an operator reading the ledger
// across the migration boundary sees both spellings.

// MailSharing is the workspace mail-sharing posture: ON, a captured email is
// readable by every colleague who can see the contact; OFF, every email
// captured FROM THEN ON is held to its participants and the capturing mailbox
// owner (the sink stamps audience='participants' at insert). Already-captured
// mail keeps the audience it has — the setting moves the default, it rewrites
// no history.
//
// Default true: sharing is the point of a CRM, and the off position exists
// for installations that accept how much harder it makes shared pipeline
// work — the settings surface says so in as many words.

// concatenates each module's list; a module that declares no settings has no
// such function, so this is opt-in rather than an interface every module must
// satisfy.
