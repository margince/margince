// One MESSAGE's rungs, rather than one member's window.
//
// The window reads (ListMine, ListWorkspace) answer "what happened to my mail
// today" and filter to the funnel stages, because a non-funnel row is a rung on
// a message's ladder rather than a message of its own. This read is the other
// half: every stored rung for ONE message, funnel or not, which is what a member
// opens when the window's one-line answer is not enough.
//
// It is deliberately not a second spelling of the window's SQL. The window pages
// a member's whole 24 hours by keyset; this fetches a handful of rows for one
// natural key. Sharing a query would mean a filter that neither caller wants.
