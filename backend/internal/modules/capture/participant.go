// it spans the mail and calendar parsers, and it must write these rows the
// same way live capture does — one spelling of the resolution, so a recovered
// row and a captured one are indistinguishable to the graph that reads them.
//
// Unlike the counterparty, these addresses are RESOLVED here rather than left
// for a later promotion. The reason is the interaction graph: its recompute
// joins a participant's user_id to a person_id (search.RecomputeEdgesForActivities),
// so an address-only row is invisible to it — and answering "who on our team
// knows this contact" from CC lines was the entire point of recording them.
// The counterparty can wait because the ensure path promotes its row moments
// later; nothing promotes a CC.

// recorded by address. An attendee nobody has a record for is a fact about the
