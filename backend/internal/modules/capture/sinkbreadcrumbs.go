// Distinct from the member-facing trace beside it (sinktrace.go), and the two
// are not redundant: a breadcrumb says what the pipeline did and names a
// natural key, and is read by whoever is debugging an installation. A trace
// says whose message it was and is read by the member whose message it was.
// Neither can be derived from the other.

// logBreadcrumbTx records one capture-gate decision on the caller's capture
// transaction. Every tier outcome a human might have to explain — a suppression,
// a T1 spare that overrode one — commits with the activity it is about, so a
// rolled-back capture never leaves a breadcrumb for a message that does not
// exist, and no gate has to borrow a second pool connection while holding one.
// extra carries breadcrumb-specific fields (at most one map; the variadic is
// there so the seven callers that need nothing beyond the reason stay unchanged).
// A key colliding with the three fixed fields is ignored — the fixed shape is
// what makes these rows queryable across actions.
