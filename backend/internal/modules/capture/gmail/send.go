// THE LOOKUP HOLDS ONLY WHILE THE PROVIDER HONOURS THE IDENTITY IT IS GIVEN,
// and Gmail does not: it discards a client-supplied Message-ID and files the
// message under one of its own. A search for the identity this system minted
// therefore matches nothing that was in fact sent, so on this provider the
// guard is inoperative and the crash window between Gmail accepting a message
// and its outcome being recorded is open, not narrowed. The guard is kept
// because it is correct on every provider that does honour the identity, and
// because nothing replaces it here — Gmail exposes no idempotency key, and once
// the identity is rewritten there is nothing left to search for.
//
// The lookup narrows that window elsewhere; it does not close it there either.
// FindByMessageID reads Gmail's search index, which is eventually consistent
// with a just-completed send — a retry landing before the index catches up gets
// a false negative and still mails twice. Nor does anything here serialize
// concurrent attempts at the same delivery: that guarantee lives entirely
// outside this package, in River delivering one job per delivery. The delivery
// store deliberately carries no in-flight status and no claim, so two

// Unlike FindByMessageID, this is a get-by-id, not a search: messages.get on
// the id messages.send just returned reads the resource directly, not the
// eventually-consistent search index the retransmission guard is warned about

//
// What comes back is CHECKED before it is reported. These are remote bytes —

// to transmit an outbound message without: one addr-spec, no control characters,
// bounded length. Anything else is reported as no identity at all rather than
// adopted, which is the already-ratified no-op.
//
// EVERY failure returns "". The message has already been transmitted when this
// runs, and returning an error would hand the delivery back to a retry whose
// prior-send lookup cannot find a rewritten identity — mailing the recipient a
// second time to fix a bookkeeping problem. An unread identity costs one
// duplicate timeline row; a re-mail costs the recipient's trust. This is the
