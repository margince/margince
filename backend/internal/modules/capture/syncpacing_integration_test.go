// How far out the scheduler actually paced the next sync, measured by the
// database against its own clock.
//
// Due/not-due cannot see this, and neither can the database-clock gate. Both
// answer "is the value derived from now()"; neither reads the UNIT the delay is
// handed over in. A ladder written as make_interval(mins => …) where the code
// means seconds is derived from now(), reads as "not due" exactly like a
// correct one, and would sit there as a 60x backoff nobody measured — which is
// the failure mode ADR-0063's ladder exists to avoid.
//
// The bounds below are deliberately wide. They are not a restatement of the
// ladder — that would only assert the constants back at themselves — but the
// order of magnitude the schedule has to land in, which is what a wrong unit
// destroys. Seconds-read-as-minutes overshoots by hours; seconds-read-as-
// milliseconds undershoots to nothing.
