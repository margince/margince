// The running page's live tally. A run's counters advance once per COMMITTED
// page (backfillpager.go), and a page is a hundred messages of provider I/O
// and capture work — long enough that the activation view sat at zero for the
// whole first page and read as an import that never started.
//
// So the page also reports what it has walked so far into the run's inflight_*
// columns, and the status read adds the two. Those columns are advisory and
// transient by construction: every write that ends a page resets them, which
// is what keeps the committed counters the one authority and a retried page

// Per creation and not per page, because a page's total is a batch and a batch
// is something to lose. Whatever writes it can fail, and nothing can rebuild it
// afterwards: capture is idempotent, so a replayed message never reaches the
// resolver again and no retry re-offers these rows to anybody. Counting each row
// as it appears leaves no batch anywhere to be dropped, double-credited, or
// fenced off.
//
// What this guarantees, exactly, and what it does not:
//
//   - It never DOUBLE-counts. A row is created once, and this runs on that
//     single outcome; nothing retries the write, so nothing can apply it twice.
//   - It is not exactly-once. The row is created in the resolver's transaction
//     and counted in this one, so a failed write loses the count of the creation
//     it was about, permanently — capture's idempotency means no replay re-offers
//     that row to anyone.
//   - The loss is per failure, and NOTHING caps the total. A database fault
//     spanning a page loses one count for every creation inside it. Calling it
//     "one row" would be true only of a single blip.
//
// So the committed columns are a floor on what the run created, never an
// overcount. Closing the gap takes a ledger keyed on the created row's id,
// idempotent under retry, with the counts derived from it rather than
// accumulated; the number feeds a progress display and the cost estimator's
// ratios. Open in #2479 rather than papered over here.
//
// Unfenced on the run's liveness and on the connection's generation. The row
// exists; a cancelled run and a rebound connection do not un-create it, and
// refusing the count would only misreport it.
