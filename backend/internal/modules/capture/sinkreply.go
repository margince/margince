	//
	// Archiving here is not only a human act: the retention evaluator
	// (privacy/retention.go) and the noise sweep (activities/capturenoise.go)
	// both archive activities by machine. So an installation running a retention
	// policy stops reply-detecting threads whose outbound legs have aged out,
	// even for a customer replying today. That follows the formula rather than
	// this file's choosing, and it is the behaviour the spec pins.
	// Matched within ONE medium, and this is a security control rather than a
	// convenience. thread_key is a single flat namespace holding both a mail
	// thread root and a channel's `<provider>:<bot>:<chat>` key, and the mail
	// half is attacker-supplied: it is the message's own References root, so a
	// sender chooses it verbatim. Without the medium match, a forged References
	// header naming a Telegram conversation — whose parts are both discoverable,
	// a bot id being public and a private chat's id being the user's own —
	// manufactures a reply fact against a conversation that sender was never in.
	// A reply is answered on the medium it arrived on, so a cross-medium match
	// could never have been actionable anyway.
	//
	// It matches on the PAIR because kind alone stopped discriminating at
	// ADR-0107/A158: every channel row now carries kind='message' whatever
	// carried it, so kind separates mail from channel but no longer one
	// transport from another — and the same forgery would then reach across
	// providers instead of across media. IS NOT DISTINCT FROM is what lets one
	// statement serve both: mail compares NULL to NULL and matches, a channel
	// compares provider to provider.
	//
	// The thread key is the whole bound, which is what makes the forged-root case
	// worth stating: a References header naming a thread the sender was never on

	// this installation itself sent. idx_activity_channel_thread is what serves it.
