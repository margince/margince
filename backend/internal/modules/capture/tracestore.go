// Reading the 24-hour trace: the funnel and one page of entries, for the
// caller's own connections or for the workspace's shared channels.
//
// The two reads differ in ONE predicate and share everything else, which is
// deliberate — the funnel and the list must never disagree about which rows they
// are describing. A count that included rows the list hides would leak by
// arithmetic what the list was careful not to show.
//
// There is no RLS behind any of this (0217, ADR-0091 §8), so every query below
// spells its own workspace predicate. §4 of that migration is blunt about the
// cost of forgetting: other users' rows rather than none, and no test failing.

// resolutionJoin reaches a message's sender's disposition.
//
// A LATERAL taking ONE row, because the ledger holds a row per address per
// state: a plain join fans out and the same message appears once per historical
// disposition. Newest resolution first, with unresolved (NULL) ahead of it — an
// open question is the current answer.
//
// Joined through the ACTIVITY's counterparty address rather than through
// activity_id: the ledger keeps one open question per address and records the
// FIRST activity that raised it, so joining ids would answer only a sender's
// first message and leave their later ones reading "waiting on a verdict"
// forever after the verdict landed.
//
// Through the activity rather than t.counterparty because the trace holds no
// address unless an operator enabled payloads, and what a member is told must
// not depend on a diagnostic posture.
//
// A channel row reports a verdict only when the LADDER ITSELF opened the
// question, and the OUTCOME is what says so, because the transport cannot.
// kind='message' forces channel_provider non-null for every channel record, so
// that column says "this arrived on a channel" and never which ladder decided
// it — while two records that differ exactly there both reach this join. One
// names its human by a channel identity and takes decideChannelCounterparty,
// which writes no ledger row at all; an address riding along as corroboration
// must not make it inherit a mail verdict raised by somebody else's message.
// The other names its human by an ADDRESS alone — a mention, where the address
// IS the identity — runs the mail ladder like any mail, and defers a question
// that is its own to answer.
//
// LadderDispositionOutcomes is therefore the discriminator, and it holds only
// while a channel-identity record traces none of them. That is a property of a
// module this query cannot see, so it is gated where the writer is:
// TestChannelRecordSkipsEveryMailDomainGate drives the real Sink and asserts
// the outcome. Mail is unguarded, so a `captured` row carrying noise_prior or
// decided_prior still reports the settled PRIOR verdict that explains it.
//
// A MEMBER'S OWN VERDICT IS THEIRS, and the ledger says which one is: the same
// `NOT resolved_by_owner OR owner_id = <the reader>` the stranded-contact scan
// asks (strandedcontacts.go). A machine verdict is a fact about the sender and
// applies to everybody; one a person reached is a fact about their own
// correspondence. Without it a workspace row — whose t.user_id is NULL — reports
// whatever a colleague decided about that address, and this read is exactly
// where a manager sees it.
//
// It also settles which of several historical rows answers: the ledger keeps one
// per address per owner, so the newest-first LIMIT 1 was picking between people
// rather than between times.
//
// BOTH joins carry the workspace, and that is not belt-and-braces: there is no
// RLS on these tables since 0217, an address is not unique across tenants, and
// an unscoped `d.email = a.counterparty_email` would answer with ANOTHER
// workspace's verdict about the same person.
//
// The widened arm additionally requires a MEMBER, which keeps it on the
// personal side of the read. `a.channel_provider IS NULL` used to make that
// structural: a workspace-owned row could not reach the ledger through it at
// all. An outcome does not carry that property, so it is stated. A ledger row's
// owner_id is an individual, and ListWorkspace is the scope a manager holds a
// grant for — so without this, the day a workspace-owned binding emits an
// address-named record, that grant would start answering with dispositions
// raised by one member's own correspondence. A workspace row losing a verdict
// it could have shown is a gap on a screen; the other direction is a member's
// mail becoming readable by their manager.
//
// The outcome list is spelled as SQL literals so both queries stay compile-time
// constants; TestTheResolutionJoinSpellsEveryLadderDispositionOutcome holds the
// literals equal to LadderDispositionOutcomes, so a tier that starts recording a
// disposition cannot join that list and leave this join behind.
