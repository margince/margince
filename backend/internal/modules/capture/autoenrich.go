// The captured-organization auto-enrich sweep's store (CAP-PARAM-7,
// ADR-0072/A118): the per-org attempt cursor (capture_auto_enrich_state), the
// per-workspace daily spend cap (capture_auto_enrich_budget), and the due-org
// candidate read. Compose owns the sweep worker and the deep-read enqueue; this
// store owns the scheduling state and the atomic cap reservation so the two are
// one transaction each. The candidate read joins organization / site_read
// (people-owned) — a read is bounded by its own workspace predicate, not by
// which module owns the table — so all the sweep's eligibility logic lives in
// one place.

// newest first (ADR-0072): with a live primary domain, no dossier, and either
// no cursor row or a due one under the attempt bound. The query's own
// workspace predicate scopes it to the bound workspace.
//
// The population is every company with a live primary domain and no dossier,
// however it was named. ADR-0072 scoped this lane to auto-created companies
// (name_source='domain') — "the company nobody has named". Lars overruled that
// on 2026-08-19, twice: "when I create a company and if admin enabled automatic
// website read then this should be also put on the list for website ingestion",
// and "If I manually create a company auto enrich must also be triggered." A
// person typing the name is not a reason to withhold the dossier; it is usually
// the moment they want one.
//
// The old rule had also made the lane inert rather than selective: all 195
// organizations in the demo workspace carry name_source='human', so the sweep
// had no candidate at all and had never enriched anything.
//
// The anchor stays out, now by its OWN predicate rather than as a side effect
// of being human-named — removing name_source without this would have started
// offering it. Two reasons it does not belong here. It is enriched during cold
// start already (people/company.go's cold-start read-back, distinct from the
// human write), so a sweep over it is redundant — Lars, 2026-08-20: "Gradion
// (anchor) IS enriched during coldstart and does not require auto enrichment
// later." And this lane applies what it finds directly, while the anchor's own
// refresh compares every proposal against confirmed truth and asks the human to
// resolve each conflict (ADR-0065 §8); offering it here would write machine
// values onto the one company the installation IS, outside that comparison.
//
// The site-read clause excludes a company whose dossier exists or is still
// coming. A read that ended with NO dossier is not one: a failure, and a
// cancellation — the operator had auto-enrich off when the worker claimed the
// read. Reading a cancellation as a dossier would make turning the setting back
// on a permanent no-op for every company whose read it stopped, which is the
// opposite of the self-healing this sweep is for.
