// The registered connector and its outbound seam (telegram-oa design §8.2,
// §8.4): the connector.MessageSender the workspace's bot binding transmits
// through, and the ONE place Telegram's own sentinels become the shared send
// vocabulary a dispatcher classifies on.
//
// That mapping is the safety property, not a formality. Telegram's sendMessage
// has no idempotency key and no prior-send lookup, so a retry can never discover
// that an earlier attempt already delivered — which means an outcome Telegram
// never reported must be declared UNKNOWN
// (connector.ErrSendOutcomeUnknown) and never retried. Every other class here is
// a definite answer FROM Telegram: nothing was transmitted, so the caller's
// ladder may safely try again.
