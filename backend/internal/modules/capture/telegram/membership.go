// The my_chat_member update (design §4.2 D9): Telegram's report that one
// user's standing toward the bot changed — blocked it, unblocked it, or
// something the two states below don't cover. It is not a message and never
// becomes one; ParseMembership is the pure classification the ingest worker
// runs BEFORE Normalize, so this update kind never takes the message path
// and never mints an activity.

// Telegram's chat_member.status vocabulary, restricted to what a PRIVATE
// (1:1 bot) chat can actually report — ParseMembership refuses every other
// chat kind, so a group's own statuses (restricted, administrator, creator)
// never reach a caller of this package and are deliberately not named here.
// StatusKicked and StatusMember are design §4.2/D9's two reachability edges.

// Membership is one my_chat_member update, pure-parsed: the identity it
// names, the status Telegram reported for it, and the update's own sequence
// number.
//
// UpdateID is Telegram's per-bot counter, and it is what orders two
// transitions against each other: the ingest queue runs several workers, so
// the block and the unblock that answers it can reach the write path in
// either order, and only the counter says which one Telegram issued last.
type Membership struct {

// chatMember is the `new_chat_member` object, narrowed to the one field that
// says anything about the customer: the status. Its `user` is deliberately not
// modelled — see chatMemberUpdated for why that user is the wrong identity.

// chatMemberUpdated is the `my_chat_member` field's own payload shape, and the
// customer's identity comes from Chat.
//
// `my_chat_member` reports a change to THE BOT's own membership, so
// new_chat_member describes the bot's standing and new_chat_member.user IS the
// bot: keying reachability on it would write against the bot's numeric id, an
// id no Person ever carries, so the update would report success having changed
// nothing. A private chat's id, by contrast, IS the counterpart user's id —
// exactly the id person_channel_identity is keyed on. `from` names whoever
// PERFORMED the change, which coincides with the subject only because a private
// chat holds nobody else; the chat is the subject definitionally, so that is
// what this reads.

// membershipEnvelope reads only the fields ParseMembership needs out of
// Telegram's update JSON: the membership payload and the update_id that sits
// beside it. A pointer field (not a value) is how "this update carries no
// my_chat_member at all" is told apart from "it carries an empty one" — the
// same reason telegramUpdate.Message is a pointer in normalize.go.

// Normalize consumes) carries a PRIVATE-chat my_chat_member update. ok is
// false for every other update kind — a message, an edited_message, anything
// this package does not classify as membership — which tells the caller to
// fall through to the message path instead.
//
// ok is false for a my_chat_member in a group too, and that is the same
// answer rather than a special one: a group's my_chat_member reports the BOT
// being added or removed, so no customer's reachability changed, and group
// chats are out of scope besides (normalize.go's chatTypePrivate). Falling
// through lands it on Normalize, which carries no message and so counts it as
// the deliberate skip it is.
