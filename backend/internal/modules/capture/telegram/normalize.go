// chatTypePrivate is the ONLY chat type this connector captures: design §1

// reply resolves its recipient through the sender's channel identity — which
// for Telegram is the sender's PRIVATE chat — so a message filed under a group
// thread would be answered somewhere else entirely, or refused outright by a

// happen here.

// The id has to agree with the label, because the label is only the payload's
// claim about itself. Telegram numbers a private chat POSITIVE and a

// never be published into.
//
// Zero is no chat at all, and it matters most on the membership path, which
