// One is the MAPPING: a channel message has to arrive at the Bot API as the chat,
// the text and the anchor it named, because a reply that loses its anchor reads
// to the customer as a message out of nowhere. The other is the CLASSIFICATION,
// which is a safety property rather than a nicety: the dispatcher decides whether
// to try again purely from the class this file produces, and one mis-mapped
// sentinel is either a message that never goes or one the customer receives
// twice.
