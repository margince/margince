// and a real vault. What it proves cannot be proven against a mock: the lookup
// is keyed on the WORKSPACE rather than on a user id, it selects only a live
// connection, and the credential it hands back is the very bot token connect
// sealed — a resolve that returned the wrong bot's token would transmit from a
// bot the customer never opened a chat with, which Telegram refuses after the
// rep has already written the message.
