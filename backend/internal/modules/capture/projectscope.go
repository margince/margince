// onto an activity the caller can read, so both are reads OF A PROJECT and both
// carry the project's own gate: the object grant first, then the row-scope
// predicate. Without the object grant, a connector principal holding only
// activity create/read would have a project id planted on its timeline out of a
// table it may not open — EnsureLinkTarget at the write checks row visibility,
// which is a different question and does not answer this one.
