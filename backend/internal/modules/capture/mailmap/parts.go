// Every bound lives HERE rather than in each provider adapter, because a bound
// enforced per adapter is a bound the next adapter forgets. Gmail, IMAP and
// Graph all hand their RFC822 bytes to this one parser, so this is the single

//
// Three things about an inbound part are never taken on trust: how many there
// are, how big they are, and what they claim to be. A sender controls all
// three, and each has its own answer below — a cap, a cap, and a sniff.
