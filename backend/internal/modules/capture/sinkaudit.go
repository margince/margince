// Capture-audit minimization (ADR-0072/A118): a connector-captured activity's
// audit after-image is metadata-only — the natural key, kind, direction, and
// timestamp — never the subject/body. The message content already lives on the
// activity row and the raw_capture blob under their own retention; duplicating
// it into the append-only audit spine (which survives an erasure differently,
// and is special-category-adjacent for mail) is the "noise is not stored" gap
// this closes. Field/record-history for a captured activity therefore show its
// metadata, not its body. Human-authored activities (activities.LogActivity)
// keep their full audit image.
