// They exist because every other transition needs someone to be holding the row
// — a worker with a claim, or a human with a decision. These handle the cases
// where nobody is: a row whose attempts ran out while no model ever answered, a
// question a human declined (approvals runs only the approved branch, so a
// decline reaches the ledger by reconciliation rather than by being told), and
// the mail a judged-noise sender keeps writing after their verdict.

// All three are claim-free and idempotent by construction. A stranded row is
// held by nobody, so requiring a lease to rescue one would mean the rows most in
// need of rescue are exactly the ones that cannot be.

// that company, in both directions. The verdict is evidence about the mail the

//

//     stranger's forged header must never reach it.

//     from the governed send path stamping its own outbound row.
//   - Never linked to a person, and never for an address a person EXISTS for.

//     to correct a wrong verdict — the sender is a counterparty and a stale
//     disposition has no authority over their mail. Linkage alone is not enough:
//     a manually created contact backfills no activity_link.
//
// And the disposition stops applying entirely once the workspace CORRESPONDS

// counterparty, and it is the recovery path that makes an automatic hide safe to
// live with — reply to a wrongly-hidden sender and the sweep lets go.
