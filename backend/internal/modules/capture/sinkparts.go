package capture

// The files a captured message carried, handed to the module that owns them.
//
// Capture never writes the attachment table. It owns the transaction and the
// provenance; the timeline module owns the row shape, the account roll-up and
// the idempotency key, exactly as it does for a human upload. This is the same
// arrangement capture already has with people for counterparties — the seam is
// how capture stays out of a sibling's tables.
//
// Nothing here decides bounds, filenames or content types, and the two halves of
// that have different reasons. Bounds belong to whichever producer reads the
// bytes, because bounding is what lets it read them at all — today that is the
// one mail parser every adapter shares. Filenames and content types belong to
// the ONE published pair every producer calls (extension.SafeFilename,
// extension.SniffContentType), so no producer can certify the field whose whole
// purpose is to distrust it. Either way a bound enforced twice is two bounds
// that can disagree.

// producer starts carrying files. `other` is the honest answer for a captured
// file that arrived on neither: the contract calls it "the honest default, not a
// fallback for an unknown value", and this is exactly the case it describes.
