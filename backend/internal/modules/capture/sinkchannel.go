// Landing inside it is not a near miss. The activity would commit after the

// the link-walking selector afterwards — and a record from a transport that
// holds no address, which is every core channel connector, carries no
// counterparty_email for the mail selector to find either. So no later erasure,
// subject-access or retention pass could ever find it, while the erasure's own
// audit tombstone records a clean scrub. A corroborating address narrows that
// window where one exists; it does not close it, because the transports most
// likely to be erased on are exactly the ones with no address to carry. The
