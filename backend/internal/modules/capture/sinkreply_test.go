// The shapes replyOriginOf answers WITHOUT a database: a record naming nobody,

// contact lookup, which is what lets a nil tx stand here — and asserting that
// is the point, because a shape that reached the lookup with a nil tx would
// panic rather than refuse.
//
// The mail and channel arms both query, so they are proved in the integration
// lane (compose/integration) against a real Postgres.

// (admitCounterpartyShape) decides whether the record is captured at all, and

// at the edge but unhandled in the resolver fails MID-TRANSACTION — after the
// activity, its audit row and its captured event are written — which the
// connector retries forever. Walking both in one test is what keeps the pair
// honest; covering only the resolver would leave the edge free to admit
// something nothing downstream can answer for.
