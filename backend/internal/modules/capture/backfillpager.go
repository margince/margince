// RunBackfillStep executes ONE provider page of a run and commits its
// outcome. It returns done=true when the run reached a terminal state (so the
// job stops), and completed=true ONLY on the single step that transitions a
// live run to a successful `done` — the caller uses that edge to fire the
// same-day digest so a freshly-imported mailbox surfaces on the morning
// screen without waiting for the nightly pass. An already-terminal or
// cancelled run returns done=true, completed=false (nothing new arrived). It
// never advances the cursor on a failed page — the retry resumes from the
// committed token. The sink counts land via the page-scoped stats snapshot
// the connector maintains.
//
// done answers the RUN's fate, not this call's outcome: a step that ENDS the
// run reports done=true alongside the err that ended it, so a caller reading
// done without err never pages a run that is already over.
//
// retryAfter > 0 says the page failed on something a delay repairs (a rate
// limit, an unreachable provider) and the run is still LIVE: the caller must
// come back after that delay rather than treat err as the end of the import.
// It is always 0 alongside a terminal outcome. err carries the fault detail
// either way — the run row records only its class, the caller's log owns the
