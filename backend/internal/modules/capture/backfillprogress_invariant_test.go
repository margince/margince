// The running page's tally lives in the inflight_* columns and is added to the
// committed counters by the status read, so exactly one writer may SET it from
// its parameters and every other writer of an EXISTING run row must ZERO it. A
// new terminal write that forgot the reset would not fail any behavioural test
// — it would quietly report the page's work twice — so the obligation is
// derived from the source.
//
// Derived the way tableownership_test.go derives its own: parse each file,
// reconstruct the effective SQL of every statement (the fragments here are
// const-concatenated, so a literal alone is not the statement), and judge the
// whole statement. A line-window scan over raw text missed a wrapped table
// name, an ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE arm, and a mention of the fragment's name in
// a neighbouring comment.
