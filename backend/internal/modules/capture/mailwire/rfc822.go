// Package mailwire is the OUTBOUND wire format: a provider-neutral message
// rendered as the RFC822 bytes a mail provider accepts for transmission. It is
// the sending twin of capture/mailmap, which reads the same format on the way
// in.
//
// Apart from any connector's transport concerns because it is a different
// question — that half decides WHETHER and WHEN to send, this half decides what
// the bytes are. It is also the half a reader checks against a spec: the part
// order, the transfer encodings and the boundary rules below each cite the RFC
// that requires them.
//
// Its own package because TWO providers now submit these bytes: Gmail's
// messages.send and Microsoft Graph's sendMail both take a complete RFC822
// message. A second renderer would be a second answer to questions with one
// right answer — which part comes first in a multipart/alternative, whether an
// attachment's filename rides in one header or two, where the base64 folds —
// and the way it fails is that one vendor's recipients get a blank message or a
// truncated PDF while the other vendor's do not.
