// The channel record's route through the Sink (telegram-oa design §6.4): it
// reaches the channel ensure seam, and it leaves behind none of the artifacts
// the mail tier ladder writes about a sender it judged.
//
// That pairing is the whole assertion. Before the channel path existed a
// domainless record simply derived nothing, so "no ledger row, no breadcrumb"
// alone would have passed on a record nothing happened to; and if the mail
// ladder were ever widened to swallow channel records, its address-keyed
// deferral would fail inside the gate savepoint and leave exactly such an
// artifact behind. The fourth gate — the impersonation quarantine — lives in
// people and is proved there (TestQuarantineSuspectNeedsADomainToJudge).
