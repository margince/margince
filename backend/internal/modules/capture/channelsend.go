// The send-side resolve for a channel connection (telegram-oa design §8.3).
//
// SenderFor (registry_connections.go) answers "which mailbox does THIS HUMAN
// transmit through", keyed (user_id, provider) because capture_connection models
// one human's grant of one connector. A channel binding is not that: an admin
// connects a bot on behalf of the whole workspace, so there is no user id to
// resolve by and the lookup is keyed on the workspace alone — spelled as the
// statement's own predicate against the bound GUC, since core 0217 retired the
// policy that used to supply it.
//
// What does NOT change is the seat check. The human who staged the delivery is
// still re-read at transmit time by the dispatcher's SeatAuthority; only the
// credential lookup moves off their account. A rep without a live, mutating seat
// is still refused, whichever transport their message was staged against.
