// The two lifecycle changes a live channel connection admits after connect
// (telegram-oa design v2 §4): replacing the bot token in place, and
// disconnecting. Split from channelconn.go to stay under the file-length cap;
// the ordering rules and the wiring guards they rely on live there.
//
// What makes editing safe rather than merely convenient: Telegram user ids are
// global, and person_channel_identity's key omits the bot id, so every identity
// binding — and all captured history — keeps resolving across a token rotation
// or even a swap to a different bot.
