// The deferral CEILINGS (ADR-0072/A118): how many open questions a workspace,
// and any one sender domain inside it, may hold at once.
//
// They live apart from pending.go because they answer a different question from
// the rest of the ledger. Every other rule in this module is about one row's
// lifecycle; these two are about the SIZE of the work list, and the party who
// grows it is an outsider — anyone who can mail the connected mailbox from fresh
// addresses mints ledger rows, and every row is a promised model call.

// mints ledger rows, so without a ceiling a stranger sets the workspace's AI
// spend. At the cap capture stops queueing questions — the messages still land
// on the timeline, they simply go unjudged, which is the safe direction to fail:
// a backlog of unanswered questions is recoverable, junk records are not.
