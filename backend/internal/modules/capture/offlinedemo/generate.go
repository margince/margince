// The threads are derived from the account's own state rather than picked at
// random: a company at Proposal has an offer thread, a customer has a kickoff,
// a contract about to run out has a renewal chase. That is what makes the
// inbox agree with the pipeline instead of being decoration beside it.
//
// Deterministic throughout. Message ids, dates and template choices are
// hashed from the account, so a re-sync emits the same conversation and the
// natural key refuses it. Nothing here reads the clock except through the
// account's own created_at, which the directory supplies.
