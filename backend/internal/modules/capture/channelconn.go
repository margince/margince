// The workspace-level channel connection (telegram-oa design v2 §4): one bot
// binding per row, connected by an admin on behalf of the whole workspace
// rather than by one human over their own mailbox (which is what
// capture_connection models, and why channel_connection is a separate table —
// 0151_channel_connection.up.sql carries that reasoning).
//
// Connect's ORDERING is the load-bearing part of this file, and it is spelled
// out at Connect itself. Ingress PULLS (compose/telegrampoll.go), so there is no
// registration to make and no provider call after the insert: connect either
// succeeds as `connected` or writes nothing.
//
// The write is AUDIT-ONLY, the same ratified posture auditLifecycle documents
// for capture_connection (EVT-NOEVT-3): the closed event catalog
// (shared/kernel/events) defines no verb for a channel connection, so there is
// no event half to emit. Adding one is a spec change, not a local decision.
