// The ledger's REVIEW-QUEUE side: the transitions that involve a human rather
// than a worker.
//
// They are guarded differently from the claim lifecycle in pending.go, and the
// difference is the point. A claimed row is held by a worker and every write to
// it presents that worker's claim token; an `unsure` row is held by nobody and
// is waiting for a person, so its writes CAS on the status instead. Mixing the
// two guards is how a row ends up either unwritable or writable by the wrong
// party.

// human already answered would ask them the same question every hour forever.
