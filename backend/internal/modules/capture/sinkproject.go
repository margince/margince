// Filing a captured message under a project (PROJ-FORM-1..3): a deterministic
// ladder, run AFTER the capture transaction committed, first match wins, no
// model call anywhere in it.
//
// Most mail belongs to no project and that is the correct answer. The ladder is
// therefore allowed to conclude nothing — it never guesses, and it never fails
// a capture. Concluding nothing is silent: no link, and no question raised for
// a human either. A message whose sender named no project named no project.
//
// The first two rungs read the timeline rows capture itself writes — the
// thread's siblings and the activity's own links — and the third touches no
// project SQL at all: which project a subject's tokens name is asked through
// the ProjectKeyMatcher seam, which compose implements from the module that
// owns the project table. A module never imports a sibling.
