// The run execution machinery (PI-STATE-2): submit one queued run, poll the
// in-progress ones, expire dead in-flight markers. Called by the compose job
// workers under a workspace-bound DB; no RBAC gate here, because a run was
// admitted and row-gated when it was queued and these passes only advance it.
//
// The egress lease (PI-AC-5): every path that unseals a credential holds
// LockWriteIdentity("provider_connection", provider) in the SAME transaction
// that re-reads the execution epoch and resolves the vault ref (GetOn).
// Disconnect takes the same lock before bumping the epoch and nulling the
// ref, so the two serialize: a disconnect lands either before the worker's
// read (it sees the bumped epoch and never calls) or after it (the call was
// authorized when it left). The residual window is one already-authorized
// in-flight request; what the terminal writes below guarantee is that no
// result obtained after a disconnect is ever STORED, and no new egress
// starts.
//
// Money rule: only a definite pre-work refusal releases a hold. Once
// inflight_at is set the request may have reached the provider, so every
// unknown outcome lands in submission_unknown with the reservation HELD —
// releasing it would let the next run spend credits the customer may already
// have been charged (poolUsedThisMonth excludes only skipped and cancelled).
