// Consumption over time (PI-FORM-3): what enrichment cost this installation,
// per calendar month and per credit pool.
//
// It answers a different question from the credit balance beside it on the
// card. That number is the PROVIDER's — how much is left to spend, and the
// customer may be spending the same credits through the provider's own app.
// This is OURS: what this installation consumed, read from the same
// reservation rows the monthly ceiling is enforced against.
//
// Those two must never disagree, which is why the charge expression below is
// the one poolUsedThisMonth uses, spelled once and shared. A spend figure
// whose arithmetic differed from the ceiling's would tell a customer they had
// budget left while the next run was refused for having none.
