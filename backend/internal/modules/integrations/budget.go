//
// Three properties matter, and each is protecting a charge the customer did
// not authorize:
//
//   - The WHOLE worst case is held, including every cascade the frozen policy
//     permits. Reserving only the primary pass would let a run submit and then
//     discover it cannot afford its own fallback.
//   - Pools are locked in a fixed alphabetical order, so two runs touching the
//     same two pools cannot deadlock by taking them in opposite orders.
//   - It is all-or-nothing. A partial reservation rolls back with the
//     transaction and the run is skipped, never half-submitted.
