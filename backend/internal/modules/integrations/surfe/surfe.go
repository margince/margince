// Package surfe is the live Surfe adapter: the one place in this build that
// speaks a vendor's wire protocol (ADR-0101, ARCH-SEAM-17).
//
// It translates a frozen request into Surfe's v2 asynchronous bulk-enrichment
// API and its answer back into the bounded shape the platform stores. It
// decides no policy, widens nothing that was requested, and never sees the
// database — everything it knows about a subject arrives in the Request the
// caller built.
//
// One person per request, though the endpoint accepts up to ten thousand.
// The platform's unit of spend, of consent and of erasure is the RUN, and a
// run is one subject: batching would tie several subjects' fates together, so
// one refusal or one ambiguous answer would put every person in the batch
// into the same unknown state.
