// Turning Surfe's answer into the bounded claim shapes the platform stores.
//
// Two rules govern everything here, and both exist because the alternative
// asserts something the vendor never said:
//
//   - An EMPTY STRING is not a value. Surfe returns "" for job-history fields
//     it does not have, and a stored empty string renders as a blank line on
//     the page and exports as one in an Art. 15 package.
//   - A label the platform inferred is never presented as the provider's.
//     emailType is frequently ABSENT even under the professional cascade, so
//     the address is labeled from what was REQUESTED and marked as such —
//     the person page reads that marker to say which is which.
//
// What the vendor returns beyond the requested categories is dropped: the
// claim vocabulary is closed, and no raw payload is retained.

// is why a run that asked for an email and a mobile but got only the email
// releases the mobile hold.
//
// One credit per pool, not one per value, and that is the load-bearing part.
// Surfe's `emails` array is PLURAL: it returns every address it found for the
// subject, from the single lookup the run paid for. Counting them would bill
// a well-documented person more than a thinly-documented one for the same
// question, and would exceed the reservation the platform took — a number
// reconcile writes into actual_credits and poolUsedThisMonth sums against the
// customer's monthly ceiling, so the over-charge would silently eat budget
// later runs were counting on.
//
// The platform clamps this against the run's own reservation as well
// (integrations.reconcile): this function knows what the vendor answered, and
// only the ledger knows what was held.
