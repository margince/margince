// bulk-enrichment API:
//
//	POST /v2/people/enrich      → an enrichment id (202)
//	GET  /v2/people/enrich/{id} → IN_PROGRESS, or COMPLETED with the people
//	GET  /v1/credits            → the balance, which is also the credential check
//
// Every failure classifies into the port's closed Outcome vocabulary. The one
// that matters most is OutcomeAmbiguous: a timeout or an unreadable answer
// AFTER the request left means the charge may have happened, so the run parks
// with its reservation held rather than retrying into a second charge.
