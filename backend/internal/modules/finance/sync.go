// The sync pass: read the source, write what changed, and nothing else.
//
// **The hash is over the SOURCE RECORD, never over a derived value.** An
// invoice's status depends on today — an open invoice becomes overdue at
// midnight with nobody touching it — so a hash that included status would make
// every morning's pass rewrite every row, emit an event per invoice, and
// report change where none happened. Status is recomputed on read instead;
// what is hashed is the dates and the amounts, which do not move unless the
// source moved them.
//
// The write shape here is the mirrored row and its audit row in ONE
// transaction, `captured_by` stamped from the connector principal the sweep
// runs as — which is what makes every mirrored row say a connector wrote it
// rather than a person. There is no outbox event, and audit.go carries the
// whole reason: the event catalog is closed and holds no finance type, so the
// mirror publishes nothing until the contract ratifies one.
