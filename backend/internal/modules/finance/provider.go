// The seam an accounting source is read through.
//
// It exists so the mirror has exactly one shape to ingest, whatever produced
// the rows: the offline generator this repo ships, and whatever real provider
// a fork adds. A provider ANSWERS records; it never writes them, never decides
// what an invoice's status is today, and never sees the database.
//
// The one rule that shapes the whole interface: a provider returns what the
// SOURCE said, and the mirror derives everything else. Status is the sharpest
// case — "overdue" is a function of today, so a provider that returned it
// would produce a different record every morning for an invoice nobody
// touched, and every sync would rewrite rows that did not change.
