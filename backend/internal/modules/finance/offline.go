// real accounting system is connected (A128 pins an offline fake first).

// It is labelled honestly at every level — the connection's provider is
// `offline_demo`, and the card shows that string — because a figure a reader
// cannot tell from a real one is worse than no figure.
//
// **Deterministic, and deterministic in the right way.** The seed is
// sha256(workspace | external customer id), so the same customer produces the
// same ledger on every machine, in every test, forever. What it does NOT
// depend on is the clock: a second sync on a later day must produce the same
// records, or every morning's pass would rewrite every row and the mirror
// would report change where none happened. Dates are generated backwards from
// a fixed epoch rather than from `now` for exactly that reason.
