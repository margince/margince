// The images the mirror's audit rows carry, and the connection's transition
// rule. The `storekit.Audit` calls themselves sit at the six write statements,
// so each one is ratified on its own key in `auditOnlyWrites` — a seventh
// finance write would arrive unratified rather than inheriting a waiver
// somebody wrote about four tables.
//
// Why the audit row at all: the mirror holds MONEY, and an audit row cannot be
// written after the fact. An invoice mirrored without one stays permanently
// unaccounted for, and the erasure and retention reasoning that reads
// audit_log is blind to it. So it commits in the same transaction as the
// domain row, from the same connector principal that stamped `captured_by`.
//
// AUDIT-ONLY, deliberately, and this is the whole rationale — read it before
// adding an emit. The event catalog is CLOSED: an event type exists because a
// contract declares it, and a build may not mint one to satisfy a rule. The
// catalog carries no finance verb at all, and neither of the two types that
// look adjacent fits. `mirror.*` belongs to the overlay write-back stream, so
// staging a mirrored invoice under it would route an accounting fact to
// subscribers watching for something else entirely. `organization.updated`
// would tell every subscriber that a company record changed when none did.
// Publishing under either is worse than publishing nothing: a wrong envelope
// is acted on, an absent one is not.

// audit rows whose before and after differ only in `sync_hash` — a trail saying
// money moved without saying what moved, which is the gap this exists to close.
// A source restating net 1000 → 1200 as a tax correction, gross unchanged, is

// without it that write would record before == after.

// One shape for both sides. The before image is read off the row and the after
// is derived for the write, and a reader diffing them has to be comparing like
// with like — two shapes would make an absent field indistinguishable from a
// field that went away.
//
// There is no `paid_minor`: the mirror does not store it. What the source said
// it received arrives as `open_minor`, which is gross less paid, clamped at
