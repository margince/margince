// The eight sections of ADR-0097 D5, in their fixed order.
//
// Four of them are specified as deterministic (header, attendees, commitments,
// company context) and four as model-written (goal, deal state, risks, talking
// points). No model lane is wired to this surface yet, so all eight are written
// here from the assembled records and `generated_by` says `deterministic`
// rather than passing a composition off as a written brief. When a lane
// arrives, the four M sections gain a writer and this file stays as their
// floor — a workspace with no model gets a plainer brief, not a blank one.
//
// Every sentence cites a record. That is not a nicety of the floor: it is the
// same contract the model sections will be held to, so the card renders and
// behaves identically whichever wrote it.
