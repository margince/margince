// "When we last met" — the prior meetings with this same room.
//
// It is the one fact a delivery review asks for first and the brief could not
// answer. Everything else on the page describes the state of play; this
// answers "what did we agree in this room last time", which is what a reader
// actually opens a recurring meeting wanting to know.
//
// It replaces the company-context line rather than adding a ninth section: the
// section list is a CLOSED enum by contract, and the brief is budgeted as a
// two-to-three-minute read. What it displaces was one sentence saying the
// company is where the lead attendee works — a fact the header already
// implies.

//
// Scoped three ways, and each is load-bearing:
//   - the activity row scope, so a meeting the caller may not discover is not
//     named to them;
//   - the same project rule the rest of the brief runs, so a scoped brief does
//     not reach into the other engagement for its history;
//   - overlapping attendees, because "this room" is the people, not the
//     recurring calendar entry — a series that changed its title is still the
//     same conversation, and two different meetings on one account are not.
//
// And it recalls only meetings that actually HAPPENED: earlier than this one,
// already past, and not cancelled or no-showed. "You met 4 days ago" about a
// meeting nobody attended is worse than saying nothing.
//
// project is the one the brief is narrowed by — the meeting's own filing,
// or the one the caller asked to prepare for — resolved by the caller so the
// history cannot read wider than the sections beside it.
