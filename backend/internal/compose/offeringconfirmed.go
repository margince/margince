// name, an offer summary and an ideal-customer profile, each written by a
// human through the company form. That is the same bar onboarding uses to
// decide the installation has finished describing itself, so the growth fit
// and the onboarding flow cannot disagree about whether we know who we are.

// rather than as an error. The 404 from GetCompany is the onboarding signal,
// not a fault, and a workspace mid-onboarding should still get capped bands
// with the reason spelled out — not a broken panel.
