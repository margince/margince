// The certification case for summarize/org_dossier.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request is built by orgdossier's own
// writer and the reply is read by orgdossier's own parser and grounding
// filter. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays
// green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the recorded fields a correct description
// has to be built on. Not the wording — the whole reason this lane exists is
// that the same facts read better as prose than as a list, and pinning
// sentences would fail a good dossier for choosing different words.
