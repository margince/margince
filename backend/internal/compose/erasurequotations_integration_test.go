// Erasure and subject-access over the QUOTATIONS a staged proposal carries.
//
// Evidence (core 0244) is the material a claim was read out of, quoted verbatim
// so the human confirming it checks the text instead of trusting the model. For
// a transcript proposal that quote is up to 500 characters of the meeting's own
// lines — which makes a staged approval a second copy of a body every other
// scrub reaches only through the activity.
//
// Nothing else in this package can find it. A proposal read from a meeting is
// filed against the ACTIVITY, never the person, so the target arms of
// subjectApprovalMatch cannot fire; and people are quoted in meetings by NAME,
// so the address patterns usually cannot either.
//
// The two directions are tested apart, because they are different obligations
// that a single "the words are gone" assertion would conflate. What the cascade
// DESTROYED it must destroy everywhere (the quote goes with the body). What the
// cascade KEPT it must not touch — a meeting shared with somebody else, or one
// under a hold, survives, and a proposal read out of it belongs to whoever is
// still on it.
