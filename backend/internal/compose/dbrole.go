// runtimeRoleQuery reads the connected role's exemptions and its ownership
// inside the extension schema in ONE round trip. current_user is resolved in
// the same statement rather than fetched separately: a pooler can hand a
// second query a different session, and the answer would then describe a role
// this pool never serves under.
//
// The ownership arms are catalog joins, not a cast of 'ext' to regnamespace:
// the schema is created by the extension migration namespace and is
// legitimately absent on an installation that has none, where the honest answer
// is zero objects owned rather than a boot failure.
//
// Both arms are read, and the schema arm is not redundant with the relation
// one: on an installation with no units yet composed, `ext` holds no relations,
// so a pool pointed at the owner DSN would pass on an empty count while holding
// the schema itself — and a schema owner can CREATE, and therefore later own,
// every unit table that lands in it. The empty tree is exactly the
// configuration this check must still protect.

// AssertRuntimeRole refuses to serve when the runtime pool carries an
// exemption the tier's guarantees assume it lacks. Extension code reaches the
// database through this pool, so a deployment that points it at the migration
// owner would void the DDL/runtime lane separation silently — a superuser
// bypasses every ACL check outright, and an owner of an ext relation can alter
// or drop that relation regardless of what it was granted.
//
// rolbypassrls invalidates only row-level-security policy checks, not grants;
// this tree carries no RLS policy and no workspace_id column today, so the
// guard's honest justification is defence in depth against a policy being
// reintroduced under a role that would silently ignore it, not a claim that a
// policy is enforced now.
//
// It cannot run before extension code: both binaries register the composed
// extension set while assembling their configuration, which is earlier than
// the pool exists. The claim it makes is the checkable one — no extension
// gets runtime database access under a role holding any of the three.
