//
// BotID is the bot that RECEIVED this update, pinned here by the poll that read
// it, and never resolved from the connection row when the job runs. ReplaceToken
// re-points a live connection at a different bot in place, so the row's channel_id
// is mutable state: a job reading it later would build the message's natural key
// and thread_key from whichever bot is current, filing one bot's message into
// another bot's conversation — and because Telegram's message ids restart per chat
// per bot, that re-keyed natural key can equal a real message of the new bot's,
// whereupon the Sink's idempotent upsert merges two different customers' messages
// into one activity. The bot an update arrived through is a fact about that
// arrival, so it travels with it.
