// The contract does not describe the agent tool surface — it IS the agent tool
// surface. An operation carrying `x-mcp-tool` promises a client that a governed
// tool of that verb exists, and `tools/list` and `GET /v1/agent-tools` publish
// that promise. So a declared verb with no registered tool is not a gap to
// document; it is the contract saying something untrue.
//
// This is the MCP twin of the REST guarantee: `var _ crmcontracts.ServerInterface
// = Server{}` (server.go) makes a declared operation with no handler a compile
// error. Here it is a failing gate rather than a compile error only because a
// registry is populated at runtime, not by an interface.
//
// There is deliberately NO waiver map. A verb that cannot honestly have a tool
// has the wrong annotation, and the fix is `x-agent-access: human-only` in
// api/crm.yaml — which is a statement about authority, not an exemption from
// one. That is why this gate can be absolute where the old pinned backlog could
// not: the escape hatch lives in the contract, where a reviewer sees it.
