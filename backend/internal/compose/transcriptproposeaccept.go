// What confirming a transcript-derived next step actually does.
//
// Nothing until here: the reading staged a question and wrote no task, no deal
// change and no contact (GATE-AI-2). This is the only place a transcript
// proposal becomes a row, and it is the same RBAC-gated write a rep's own "add
// task" takes — the confirmation grants the act, it does not bypass the gate.

// again, cannot be redeemed again, and nothing else drives the effect. The task
// is lost and the rep is told only that "executing the effect failed". Sharing
// the transaction rolls the redemption back with the write, leaving the
// proposal exactly where it was, ready to be approved again.

// The write stays additionally idempotent on (source_system, source_id) keyed
// to the approval, which is what makes a REPLAY of the whole effect safe.
