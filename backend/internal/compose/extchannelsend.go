// The send half of the unit channel surface: how a delivery staged against a
// UNIT's transport reaches that unit's Send (DESIGN-SP5 §9, ADR-0107/A158).
//
// Everything upstream of here is the product's ordinary channel reply — the
// rep's reply box, the recipient resolved from the conversation, the consent
// gate, the staged delivery, the retry ladder. This file is the last edge: the
// core's own MessageSender seam, implemented over a unit's declaration.
//
// WHOSE CREDENTIAL TRANSMITS is the whole difference from a core connector. A
// core channel binding is the workspace's one bot; a unit's is the MEMBER's own
// sealed secret, so the delivery's user id is not decoration here — it selects
// the credential. It is the sending human's id, staged with the delivery and
// re-read at transmission, which is why a message cannot be made to leave under
// somebody else's connection by anything that happens after staging.
