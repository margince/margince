// What the reply-draft case owes the certification lane: it drives the drafter
// the product drives, it records EVERY request that drafter issued — the voiced
// attempt, the critic retry and the plain fallback are three calls, not one —
// and it judges the draft that would actually be served.
//
// The three-request shape is the reason several tests below script more than one
// reply. A case that recorded only the first would report a prompt the model was
// shown while grading an answer it gave to a different one, and the canary gate
// reads the same trace.
