// The two halves of the dossier conversation's model call: the request it
// sends, and the gate it judges the answer with. They sit together, and apart
// from the transport that calls them, because they are one seam with two
// callers — the administrator's live conversation and the certification lane
// that measures it. A lane that rebuilt either half would measure a copy, and a
// copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.

// companyReadAnswerRequest builds the ONE call this site sends: the dossier
// inside the boundary the prompt declares, the conversation so far replayed
// after it, and the administrator's current message last. It is a pure
// function of what the transport supplies, so the certification lane issues
// the request that ships rather than a re-creation of it — and a re-creation
// stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// The model is stateless, so the prior turns are messages of THIS request
// rather than a session it remembers, and they sit between the dossier and the
// current message because that is the order they happened in: a follow-up
// reference resolves against whichever turn precedes it.
//
// The fence is minted per request. A boundary a previous turn was shown is one
// whoever wrote that turn can spell, and the rule this prompt states — that the
// dossier is evidence and never instruction — can only be stated about a region
// the model can tell apart.

//promptlang:exempt this endpoint has no language to pass: it is a one-admin conversation, so the reader's locale is the right answer rather than the base language, and CompanySiteReadMessageRequest carries no locale field the way its sibling OnboardingCompanyMessageRequest does. Adding one is a contract change; tracked rather than defaulted, because guessing here would answer a German admin in English while claiming to be governed.
