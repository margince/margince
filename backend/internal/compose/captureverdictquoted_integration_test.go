// The verdict path end to end when the bound model reports its confidence as a
// JSON STRING rather than a number.
//
// The decoder's own tests prove a quoted score parses. These prove what that is
// FOR: the ledger row is decided, the sender becomes the record capture
// withheld, and the model is asked once. A quoted confidence used to fail the
// unmarshal, so the row was deferred with backoff — fail-closed and correct, and
// the reason the feature was substantially non-functional against a model that
// quotes. Nothing at the decoder level can show that, because the disposition is
// where the cost was paid.
//
// The control matters as much: a confidence that genuinely cannot be read must
// still take the deferring branch. Tolerating the wrapper must not tolerate the
// value.
