// The certification case for offer_draft/draft — the one model pass that turns a
// deal's own captured context into priced offer lines.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from offerDraftRequest, the same builder the orchestrator calls, and the
// reply is judged by groundOfferLines, the same no-guess gate the orchestrator
// applies — price ladder included. A case that rebuilt either would measure a
// copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// Both halves of that gate had a database inside them, and the whole gate is
// what makes this site's claim worth anything: an evidence check that stopped
// before the price would certify that a line is grounded while saying nothing
// about the number on it, which is the only part of a line that can cost money.
// So the catalogue read moved up to the orchestrator and the ladder's product
// re-read became rateCardLookup, served here from the fixture's own rate card.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the context items the draft must turn into
// lines, each with the price that line must carry and whether that price is
// grounded. A line's identity is the context item it cites, not its wording —
// wording is what the rubric and the judge grade, and a scenario pinning a
// description would fail a draft that said the same thing in its own words. The
// price is not prose: it is either lifted from the cited evidence, or matched to
// a rate-card product, or the honest zero sentinel, and a scenario can say which
// of the three this context supports.
//
// It is a subset claim, never an inventory: a real deal's context supports more
// lines than a scenario cares to pin, and demanding exhaustiveness would fail a
// draft for being richer than its author imagined.
