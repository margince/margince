// RecordComposition writes the two boot-time facts that follow from the
// composed extension set: the inventory of the set itself, and the channel
// vocabulary its units declare.
//
// One function because the ordering between them is not a caller's to choose —
// the reconcile reads ComposedExtensions() and refuses a unit that shadows a
// core transport, so it belongs after the set is observed and before anything
// serves. A role that wired only the inventory would boot with units installed
// and their transports unregistered, which is the state this step exists to
// make unreachable.
//
// Every process role calls it, after RegisterExtensions and before it assembles
// anything: server assembly loads the transport directory FROM the rows written
// here.
