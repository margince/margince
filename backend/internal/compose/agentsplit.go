// absent here gets the full split instead.
//
// The test for membership is the BODY's shape, not the route's. An operation
// whose path ends in a sub-resource can still be a field patch on the routed
// record — if its resolver maps the sub-resource back to the parent row, the

// protects human-typed record values from agent overwrite, while a
// catalog label rename is the action the contract deliberately pins 🟢;
// left to the split, the creating admin's audit trail would mark `label`

// actually writes, for the operations where that is NOT the route's own {id}.
//
// The ownership probe asks "who last typed this field on THIS record", so it

// {id} names the PARENT — a Deal Room, not the document inside it — and asking
// about the parent's id under the child's record type is a question no audit
// row can answer. It misses every time, the split sees no conflict, and an
// agent overwrite of a human-typed field auto-executes instead of staging:
// the §2.1 protection turns itself off silently, which is worse than being
// absent, because the route still looks governed.
//
// Adding such a route to actionShapedUpdateOps would NOT be the fix — that map
// is for calls with no human-typed field of their target at all, and a to-do's
