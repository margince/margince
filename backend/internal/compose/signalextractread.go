// dueThreads lists the conversations that have settled and have moved since
// they were last read, newest first.
//
// A conversation's account comes from the three-arm walk (the message's own
// link, its deal's account, the employer of the contact it is about) rather
// than a direct organization link. Capture files mail against the PERSON it was
// with, so a direct match resolves nothing on real correspondence — an account
// is reached through its people, or not at all.
//
// The walk is joined rather than applied as a predicate because the question
// here is which account a thread belongs to, not whether it belongs to a known
// one — and it is a LEFT join because the two things the aggregate computes are
// different questions over different rows:
//
//   - WHEN the conversation last moved, and how many messages it holds, is
//     asked of EVERY message on the thread. Counting only the resolvable ones
//     would let a thread look settled while a message nobody can place arrived
//     minutes ago, and the settle window exists precisely to keep the model out
//     of a conversation still in progress.
//   - WHICH account it belongs to is asked only of the messages that reach one;
//     count(DISTINCT) ignores the NULLs a LEFT join leaves behind.
//
// The org resolution is deliberately strict: exactly one organization across
// the whole thread. A conversation touching two accounts would have its events
// filed against whichever the join happened to pick, and a signal on the wrong
// account is worse than no signal — it is a claim the reader cannot trace back.
// A contact with two live employers makes their threads ambiguous by the same
// rule and skips them; filtering the walk down to a primary employer would buy
// those threads back by guessing, which is the thing being refused.
//
// A message whose contact reaches no account at all still reaches the PROMPT —
// threadMessages reads the conversation by thread_key alone. Resolution decides
// whose conversation this is, not which of its messages the model may read.
