// The two claims the archive resolver makes about the world outside its own
// package, against a real database.
//
// The first is a PREDICTION across a DAG boundary: agents.servedByTheRecordSeam
// decides from datasource.EntityTypes() which archives the seam can be asked
// about, and the thing that actually answers is Provider.Read's switch, one
// layer up where the module lives. A type added to the vocabulary with no arm
// in that switch would make every archive of it fault at staging, with no unit
// test anywhere able to see it — the two halves are in packages that cannot
// import each other.
//
// The second is the refusal this seam added to the REST door. The unit tests
// prove the door asks the resolver; they cannot prove that a row the caller
// may not see comes back as not-found, because they supply the answer they are
// checking for. Only RLS and the store's row-scope clauses can say that.
