// The options that hand a role authority over the SCHEMA rather than over the
// rows in it: the owner-DSN pool a custom-field DDL statement needs, and the
// non-production data reset built on top of it.
//
// They live apart from the rest of the option surface because they are the group
// where getting the wiring wrong is not a missing feature but a destructive one.
// Every other option adds a capability whose absence is an honest 501; these
// decide whether a process can drop and rebuild what an installation holds, so
// they carry their own file and their own reasoning about who may be granted
// them.

// outcome — so it is filed rather than settled here, and the pointer sits at the
