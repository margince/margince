// River wiring for the Surface-B agent scheduler (architecture/07): a
// dispatcher over every LIVE workspace and a worker that seeds and executes
// one tenant's due agent jobs. It registers itself — workers and periodic
// schedule together — so jobs.go, which owns the runner's assembly, grows one
// line as this surface does.
