// The canary gate: no site lets fixture text reach the instruction channel.
//
// Every request a site issues has two channels, and the whole prompt-injection
// posture rests on which one carries what. The system prompt is this codebase
// speaking; the user turn is data, fenced, and the model is told so. A site that
// interpolated a captured subject line, a crawled page, or an inbound mail body
// into its system prompt would hand an attacker the one channel the model is
// instructed to obey — and it would still pass every other test in the tree,
// because the request would be well-formed and the answer would look right.
//
// So the property is proved rather than reviewed: every free-text field of every
// site's own committed fixture is stamped with a string that occurs nowhere in
// this repository, the site's real Prepare/Run is driven with it, and the
// instruction channel of every request it issues must not contain that string.
//
// "Free text" is not read off the shape of the value. Prose announces itself by
// carrying whitespace, but a subject line reading "Invoice", a display name and
// a sender address are free text spelled exactly like the enums, locales and
// hashes beside them — and those a stamp would break for reasons that have
// nothing to do with the instruction channel. plantCanary tells the two apart
// by asking the site: a single-word field is offered to the site's own Prepare
// with the marker on it, and joins the run only if the site still accepts it,
// because a closed vocabulary is precisely what refuses a value outside itself.
//
// The fixtures come from the committed corpus rather than being written here.
// They are what production is actually handed — a hand-written per-site fixture
// would be one more thing to keep true, and would drift toward whatever shape
// made the test pass.
//
// What this gate deliberately does NOT assert is that a site's system prompt is
// the same for every fixture. That is false today and correctly so:
// pageFactsSystem varies with the page's kind, onboardingActSystem with the act
// and the locale, and the reply drafter has a voiced and an unvoiced variant.
// Each of those inputs is chosen by this codebase, not supplied by a stranger,
// and a gate that forbade them would be forbidding legitimate work.

// plantCanary returns a copy of a fixture with the canary appended to every

// Two kinds of field get stamped, and they are separated because only one of
// them can be recognised by looking at it:
//
// A field carrying WHITESPACE is prose, and prose is always stamped. That is
// what a mail body, a crawled page or a chat turn looks like, and it is never
// what an enum, a URL, a locale, a currency code or a hash looks like.
//
// A SINGLE-WORD field is the hard case, and it is the one a whitespace rule
// alone lets through: a mail subject reading "Invoice", a display name, a
// company name are all free text a stranger chose, and they sit in a fixture
// spelled exactly like the closed-vocabulary tokens beside them. Stamping those
// tokens is what the whitespace rule was avoiding — an enum or a locale with a
// marker glued on makes Prepare refuse the fixture for a reason that has
// nothing to do with the instruction channel, and the gate would then measure
// the refusal instead of the prompt.
//
// So the two are told apart by asking the site rather than by guessing: each
// single-word field is stamped ALONE and offered to the site's own Prepare, and
// it joins the run only if the site still accepts it. A closed vocabulary is
// exactly the thing that refuses a value outside it, and the site's validator
// is the only authority on which of its fields those are.
//
// What this does NOT establish is that every stamped single-word field reached
// the model at all. A field the site reads for its own purposes and never sends
// — a lookup id, a flag — is stamped, refuses nothing, and shows up in no
// request; the prose count returned here is what the caller's reachability
// assertion rests on, because prose is the part whose arrival can be proved.
// The gate over single-word fields is therefore one-sided: it can catch one
// reaching the instruction channel, and it cannot certify that one which never
// appears was truly never sent.
//
// The marker is APPENDED rather than substituted so the fixture still says what
// it said: a site whose validator gates on evidence present in the source text
// keeps finding it, and the scenario's expected answer stays reachable. It is
// glued to the field's last word rather than added as a new one, so a fixture
// that declares its own text's length still agrees with itself.
