// spread this logic across the estimator, so a new priced task is a contract
// entry naming a rule rather than three switch arms a change can silently miss.

	// per entity — one call per unit), the priced slices' share of the cost is
	// their share of the calls, so pricedDenom scales by pricedCalls/Σcalls.
	// When it is NOT call-based (classify's denominator is labeled MESSAGES, and
	// one call is a variable-size batch), that call-fraction reweight overquotes:
	// a 10-message priced batch and a 1-message unpriced retry are 1 call each,
