// A record write the overlay provider cannot serve must refuse in overlay mode
// on EVERY transport, and the transports reach it differently: REST passes
// through overlaywrite.go's middleware, while a tool that calls its owning
// module directly — which is what makes a tool and its route one behaviour —
// never touches a router. So the obligation is re-derived here for the tool
// path, from the same two sets the middleware reads.
//
// This file proves the SET and the one seam guard. That each derived verb
// actually answers ErrUnsupportedBySoR is proved where it can only be proved —
// against a real overlay workspace, in
// compose/integration/overlay/overlay_toolsurface_integration_test.go, whose
// nativeOnlyAgentTools drives every one of them through the live registry.
