// River wiring for the AI-activity projection's two maintenance passes: the
// reconciler that re-asserts truth from the source tables, and the retention
// pass that drops settled occurrences past their window.
//
// They are two kinds rather than one because they fail differently and cost
// differently. The reconciler re-publishes onto the bus and its failure is a
// display that stays wrong; the retention pass is an indexed delete and its
// failure is a table that grows. Sharing a kind would make one's backlog the
// other's outage.
