// A flip landing is one transaction: the native record and the identity-map
// row that names it commit together, or neither does.
//
// The two used to be separate transactions, and a process that died between
// them left a record the resume could not see — which is what flipreconcile.go
// exists to repair, by scanning for live rows carrying the reserved import
// provenance that the map does not know. That repair stays, for the orphans an
// estate already carries; what these suites pin is that no class produces new
// ones. All five land atomically, and the deal's remaining window — mapped and
// open, because the terminal stage is asserted in a second transaction — is
// settleAdoptedDeal's to close.
//
// The forced failure is the production one rather than a test hook: the
// identity row's composite FK names the import run, so a landing recorded
// against a run this workspace does not have fails at exactly the point a
// crash would — after the record is written, before the transaction commits.
