// Where the model binding comes from.
//
// It is a `setting` row, not a file read at boot. A binding an operator could
// only change by editing a file on the server and restarting both roles is one
// they change rarely and out of band — and in between, the api and the worker
// can be running different bindings with nothing saying so. In the database
// there is one answer and every role that asks gets the same one.
//
// The routing FILE keeps one job: seeding an installation that has no stored
// binding yet. That is what carries an existing deployment across the move
// without an operator doing anything, and it is why the file is read only when
// the setting is unset — an installation that has been provisioned once never
// consults it again, so a file left behind stale cannot quietly become the
// authority.
