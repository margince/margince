// The certification case for cold_start/acts.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from onboardingActRequest, the same builder the assistant calls, and
// the reply is judged by validateOnboardingActReply, the same validator the
// assistant applies. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a
// copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// This is the census's first MULTI-TURN site, and the kind names the
// conversation rather than the number of calls: the model is stateless, so the
// whole prior conversation is replayed as messages of the ONE request this site
// sends. The case replays exactly the turns the transport would have replayed,
// through companyReadConversation — the same mapping, which is also the bound
// on how many turns a call may carry. A case that dropped them would certify a
// first turn on a scenario written about a third, which is where a follow-up
// reference lives, and where an attempt to talk the assistant out of its
// instructions over several turns lives too. What is graded is still the single
// reply that follows, which is what Site.CertifiedScope already reports.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the response KIND the reply must carry. The
// act answers in prose, and prose is what the rubric and the judge are for — but
// what it returns is an envelope, and the kind is the part of it the product
// itself reads and the transport hands the UI. It is a closed vocabulary, which
// is what lets an unreachable expectation be named at Prepare instead of
// measured as a zero. Pinning the sentence would fail every model that said the
// same thing differently; pinning nothing would leave a well-formed off-topic
// reminder indistinguishable from the answer the administrator asked for.
