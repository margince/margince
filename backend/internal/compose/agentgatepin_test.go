// The REST door's half of the auto-execute version pin.
//
// ADR-0055's claim is that a passport is governed the same way on both doors,
// and the pin is part of what a 🟢 admission means: the tier was resolved by
// reading a record, so the write it admits is conditioned on the version that
// record was read at. On MCP the pin travels as the tool's `if_version`
// argument; here it travels as the request's own If-Match — the header
// redeemIfPresented already forwards for a released 🟡 call, one tier down.
//
// Admission runs through the real gate and the real resolver, in the two lines
// agentGate itself uses, so what these assert about the pin is what the
// middleware produces rather than what a hand-set context claims.
