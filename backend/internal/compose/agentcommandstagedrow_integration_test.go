// The two doors, staged for real: one operation, one record, two approval rows
// that a human could not tell apart on anything the decision depends on.
//
// The unit twin (agentcommandbothdoors_test.go) compares what each door
// RESOLVES. This compares what each door WROTE, and it has to run here for one
// reason: the version an approval pins is taken server-side inside the staging
// transaction (approvals.StageInTx), so no fake approvals engine can say
// anything about pin shape — a stub would answer whatever it was written to
// answer, for both doors, identically and meaninglessly.
//
// Two of the columns are DELIBERATELY different, and asserting the difference
// is as much the point as asserting the agreement: proposed_change and
// diff_hash are each door's own replay. A REST approval is redeemed by
// repeating the HTTP request, an MCP approval by repeating the tool call, and a
// row that carried the other door's payload would be a decision nobody could
// act on from where they made it.
