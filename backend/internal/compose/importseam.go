// The import seam: the tool surface's four import verbs, over the SAME
// handlers the REST transport uses.
//
// It delegates rather than reimplementing, and that is the whole design. The
// dry run is the only review a migrate-in flow gets, so two code paths that
// both "validate a mapping" would be two chances for them to disagree about
// what an import is going to do — and the one a person read would not be the
// one that ran.
//
// It holds the Server by pointer rather than copying importHandlers, because
// the object store arrives after assembly (WithBlobstore) and a seam that
// captured the handlers by value at wiring time could hold a copy with no
// blobstore in it. Same reason companyEnricher holds `srv` rather than a
// store. Both wiring sites build the seam AFTER the option loop has run, so
// what it points at is the Server that is actually served.
//
// A registry built with no Server at all — NewRegistry, which several roles and
// every parity gate use — gets a seam over bare handlers instead. Its reads
// work; its three source-bearing verbs refuse with errNoObjectStore, which is
// what a role that stores no objects can honestly offer. What it must NOT do is
// go missing: the contract declares these four verbs, and a registry that does
// not serve a declared verb advertises something tools/list cannot offer.
