// The certification case for site_fact_extract/page_facts.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the menu comes
// from menuForKind, the numbering from newSnippetIndex, the request from
// pageFactsRequest and the verdict from gatePageFacts — the same four steps one
// page of the deep read takes, in the same order. A case that rebuilt any of
// them would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that
// breaks the original.
//
// This is the most per-call site in the census, and it varies along two axes at
// once. The page's KIND selects the menu, and the menu is half the prompt and
// half the schema together: which lanes the model is asked for, and which fact
// fields its enum may answer with. The numbered index decides which passages the
// model is shown, which ids the schema offers, and which text the gate resolves a
// citation back into. Both are rebuilt from the fixture exactly as production
// rebuilds them per page — pinning either would certify a call the product never
// makes, on a page kind it never makes it for.
//
// The lane the production call runs on is deliberately not part of the fixture.
// The fact lane is served by its own brain when one is injected and by the main
// one otherwise, but that choice happens AFTER the request is built and does not
// change a byte of it; which model answered is the record's binding axis, named
// there rather than asserted here.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the facts this page must ground, as field to
// value. Facts are what this lane is named for and what the deep read stores as
// organization facts, and their vocabulary is the closed menu the schema enum
// offers — which is what lets an unanswerable expectation be named at Prepare
// instead of measured as a zero. The same call carries the people and entity
// lanes for the kinds whose menu asks for them, and every refusal in those lanes
// reaches the Detail, so a fabricated person or a sibling entity's address shows
// up in the record.
//
// It is a subset claim, never an inventory: one page grounds more than a
// scenario cares to pin, and demanding exhaustiveness would fail a read for being
// richer than its author imagined.
