// The account arm of the local graph: the other contacts at this person's
// employer, and which colleague is warmest with each.
//
// It exists because the direct arm is so often empty. "Nobody here knows her,
// but Ben has been talking to her head of engineering for a year" is the
// answer a rep can act on, and it is invisible to any read keyed on the
// contact alone.
//
// Split from persongraph.go because it carries its own disclosure rule: this
// arm shows counts and dates and never the messages behind them. Pooled
// interaction metadata is disclosable where the correspondence itself is not
// (ADR-0078 §124), so the receipts the direct arm attaches are deliberately
// absent here rather than merely unfetched.
