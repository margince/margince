// A coverage view without the edge grant answers "withheld", never "clean".
//
// The defect these tests hold shut is not a disclosure — it is the fix for one.
// Gating the coverage reads without a channel to report the gating would have
// left every restricted caller looking at an empty risk list, which this
// product renders as "Nothing flagged — this deal passes every coverage check".
// A wrong verdict on deal risk is worse than the pair it stopped disclosing.
