// River wiring for the outbound-webhook retry sweep (E10/B-E10.13c): a
// dispatcher over every LIVE workspace and a worker that re-attempts one
// tenant's due deliveries. It registers itself — workers and periodic
// schedule together — so jobs.go, which owns the runner's assembly, grows one
// line as this surface does.
