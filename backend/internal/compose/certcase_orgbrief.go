// The certification case for summarize/org_brief.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request is built by orgbrief's own
// writer and the reply is read by orgbrief's own grounding filter, because
// that filter is the thing standing between a reader and a sentence about a
// record they cannot open. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy,
// and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the records a correct brief has to be
// grounded in. Not the wording — a brief is prose, and pinning its sentences
// would fail a good brief for choosing different words. What production
// cannot guarantee, and this therefore measures, is whether the model wrote
// about the account it was given and cited it, rather than inventing a deal
// or a next step nobody can check.
//
// The fixture names its records by LABEL. Prepare mints the ids, so an id in
// the reply is an id the model was handed rather than one the corpus author
// could have written into the expected answer.
