// capability added has an obvious home.

// rather than a visible failure — and it is held in the reconcile, which is
// where the core's own transport set is known. Asking here would answer from a
// registry that may not be built yet, and pass the collision it exists to catch.

// the mistake becomes a message somebody receives.
