// Transport-level idempotency (crm.yaml `IdempotencyKey`): a mutating
// request carrying an Idempotency-Key is safe to retry — the first
// attempt claims the key inside the caller's workspace scope, a replay
// within 24h returns the recorded response verbatim, and the same key
// with a DIFFERENT body is refused (409 idempotency_key_conflict, never
// a silent replay of mismatched intent). The claim row is written
// insert-first, so two concurrent attempts under one key can never both
// execute: the loser sees the claim and answers 409 while the first is
// in flight. Only a 2xx outcome is recorded; a failed attempt releases
// the claim so the client may retry the same key — replaying stored
// failures would pin transient faults for 24h and would break the
// stage-then-redeem approval flow, whose retry is the same request.
