// The triage-on-capture trigger's decisions.
//
// What these cover is the part that can go wrong quietly: which gates run, in
// which order, and — for every way the trigger gives up — whether the
// domain is left in a state the daily sweep still finds. That contract is the
// entire reason the trigger is allowed to be best-effort, so it is the thing
// worth holding.
//
// These held the enrich-on-capture trigger until capture stopped creating
// organizations; the gates, their order and the shared budget counter are the
// same, and the trigger they now guard is the one that still runs.
//
// The budget counter these gates spend from is tested here too, next to the
// trigger that shares it with the sweep.
//
// What they do NOT cover is the queued read itself: starting one needs an
// ambient River client, and this repo has no harness that stands one up in a
// test. The same gap already applies to the sweep's own trigger path; the
// read-and-apply half is covered by TestAutoEnrichLaneAppliesDirectlyInsteadOfStaging.
