// Releasing a reassignment at scale (AUTO-T07's 🟡 branch).
//
// An automation that reassigns one record writes straight through the provider;
// one that reassigns at scale stages instead and waits (assign_owner_tier.go's
// resolveAssignOwnerTier). The staging half shipped and the release half did
// not, so approving the card spent a human's decision on nothing: no owner
// moved, and the run that raised it stayed in requires_approval permanently.
//
// The effect performs the same write the 🟢 branch performs — same provider,
// same ref, same patch — because a reassignment a human released must not be a
// second spelling of a reassignment an automation made. What the approval adds
// is the human, and the human is on the decision's own audit row.
//
// Two things differ, both on purpose. The 🟢 branch stamps Source "system"; this
// stamps "system:assign-owner-release", so the provenance column can tell a
// reassignment that ran on its own from one a human had to release first. And
// this write carries IfVersion, which the 🟢 branch has no use for: it writes
// immediately, while a release writes against a record that has been sitting in
// an inbox. Both are distinctions worth keeping, not accidents of two code paths.

// Redeem-then-execute, like every 🟡 executor here, and the version pin is why
// it cannot be the other way round. The redemption re-checks that the target
// still carries the version the staging pinned; performing the write first
// would bump that version and the redemption would then refuse the very write
// it had just authorized. Ordering is not a preference here — one order does
// not work.
//
// The version the redemption returns is carried straight into the write as
// IfVersion, which is what closes the gap the ordering opens. Between the
// redemption committing and the provider being called, the record is
// unprotected; pinning the write to the version the approval was granted
// against means anything that moved it in that window makes the write refuse
// rather than silently overwrite somebody.
//
// A write that fails leaves the approval spent — the accepted trade of the
// redeem-then-execute discipline, and the reason Decide reports the executor's
// cause to its caller rather than swallowing it. What must not happen is the
// run reporting success: the transition runs only after the write returns, so a
// failed reassignment leaves its run parked and honest.
