// The win-loss report and the period bucket it groups by (REPORT-KEY-8,
// REPORT-VOCAB-1, REPORT-PARAM-4..7). Three invariants earn their own tests
// because each one fails silently rather than loudly:
//
//   - A bucket must survive the derivation handle's round trip. The handle
//     carries a group key out through a URL query string and binds it back as
//     an equality predicate; a value that cannot be rendered and re-parsed
//     makes "Explain This Number" fail on exactly the reports that need it.
//   - A bucket boundary is the installation's, not UTC's. This one is
//     invisible on a UTC installation, which is most test fixtures.
//   - An OPEN deal is absent from win-loss, not a zero in it.
