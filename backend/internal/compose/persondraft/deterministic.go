// It is not an error path. A deployment that runs no model lane, or a workspace
// whose budget is spent, still has a rep who pressed "Write email" — and a
// short honest opener they edit is a better answer than a spinner that ends in
// a refusal.
//
// What it will not do is imitate the model. It states only what the input gave
// it, in plain sentences, and asks one question. No figure it was not handed,
// no claim about what the recipient thinks, no invented urgency.
