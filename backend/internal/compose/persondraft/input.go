// What one draft is written from, in the person page's own grounding order: the
// caller's intent, then who the recipient is, then the deal and the money on
// it, then what they have SAID, then what recently happened.
//
// The order is the prompt's reading order, not a preference: an instruction the
// caller typed outranks a record, and a claim the person made themselves
// outranks a message somebody merely sent them.
//
// Nothing here re-queries. Every field is folded out of the Person360 the
// caller already assembled, which is what makes the draft's scope exactly the
// reader's own scope without a second set of gates to keep in agreement.
// The folding itself lives in fold.go.
