// The model path's lane names as a fitness function: a lane is named for the
// ai.Task it rides, so a reader goes from a field name straight to the routing
// ladder, the budget posture and the certification record that govern it. A
// name that has drifted from its task reads as one workload and bills as
// another, and only a reviewer's memory ever catches that. The allowed names
// are derived from the contract's shipped task set, so a task renamed upstream
// fails here instead of leaving a stale lane behind.
//
// The rule is one-directional on purpose: a shipped task with no lane is
// legitimate. cert_judge has none because the certification lane builds the
// judge its own router (aicert/runner.go) rather than the candidate's binding,
// so a candidate can never grade itself.
