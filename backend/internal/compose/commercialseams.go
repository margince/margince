// The seams behind review_commitments and prepare_handoff.
//
// Both are assembled HERE because both cross modules: an open promise is an
// activity row, a handover is a project plus the deals rolled up to it plus
// the people attached to it plus those same promises — and a module never
// imports a sibling (ADR-0054 §9). Every read below is a module's own gated
// store path, so object RBAC and row scope apply exactly as they do on the
// HTTP surface; there is no raw SQL here and no second spelling of a filter.
//
// THE CLOCK LIVES ON THIS SIDE OF THE SEAM. The tools judge a promise as
// overdue or upcoming, and that judgement is a pure function of the due date
// and an instant. Reading the instant here — ONCE per call, and passing it
// across — is what makes the tool's derivation reproducible in a test with no
// clock in it, and what stops two rows in one answer being judged against two
// different nows.

// FOUR GATED READS, NOT ONE JOIN. Each enforces its own object grant and its

// stating, because the obvious reading of "each read is gated" is wrong for
// one of them:
//
//   - An OBJECT-grant denial FAILS the call. A caller with no `deal` read
//     grant does not get a handover with the deals left out; ListDeals
//     refuses, and that refusal is returned unchanged. Nothing is assembled
//     around a gate nobody asked for, because nothing is assembled at all.
//   - A ROW-SCOPE miss FILTERS. A deal owned outside the caller's scope is
//     simply not in the page, and the brief is assembled from what remains.
//     The gap messages say "this caller can see" for exactly that reason: the
//     honest claim is about what is visible, not about what exists.
//
// The project read runs FIRST and its refusal is returned unchanged, so a
// project outside the caller's scope answers not-found exactly as reading it
// directly would.
