// GET /overlay/export — the workspace export bundle's HTTP surface, and
// the flip's pre-flip export producer (B-E18.26's "honest-scope export
// available" gate reads the audit row this writes).
//
// It lives on the overlay lifecycle path deliberately: the general
// export-run lifecycle (IEM-WIRE-1/2 — enqueue, poll, fetch from the
// blob store) is the import-export-migration chapter's own unminted
// contract surface, and inventing it here would pre-empt that
// extension. This op is the cutover operator's bundle producer, gated
// like the rest of the lifecycle (overlay_connection UPDATE, admin/ops)
// and streamed inline rather than staged.

// overlay mode, the whole mirror), and buffering it in the API process
// would put the workspace's size between a caller and every other
// request this process is serving.

// Streaming costs the ability to answer a problem document once the
// first byte is out. That trade is deliberate and the failure is still
// honest: the gate runs BEFORE any header is written, so a refusal is a
// clean 4xx, and a mid-stream failure aborts the connection — the
// client sees a truncated, invalid zip rather than a 200 that claims a
// completeness it does not have. It is logged server-side; writing a
// problem body after the body has begun would only corrupt the archive
