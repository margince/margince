// The overlay-mode write-admission guard. In overlay mode a workspace's
// records are served from an incumbent mirror. Write-back (branch 2) routes
// canonical writes to the incumbent, but ONLY through the SoR seam — the
// datasource Provider's Create/Update/Archive verbs the Dispatcher and the
// agent tool registry call. The REST record-write handlers are the
// module-owned transports (people.Handlers.CreatePerson, …): they write
// their native tables DIRECTLY and never ride the SoR seam, so nothing on
// that path consults the overlay mode or reaches the incumbent.
//
// A native REST write against an overlay-mode workspace is only a problem
// when BOTH of these hold: the record type is one the mirror actually holds
// (overlayMirroredTypes — a tag, offer, product, list, saved view, custom
// field, relationship, or webhook subscription is never mirrored, so its
// native table is the live one even in overlay mode), and the overlay
// provider cannot itself serve that verb for the type
// (overlay.SupportsWrite) — a verb it CAN serve is let through to reach a
// write shadow rather than being refused outright. Refusing beyond that
// blocks working capability for no reason; letting a write through when
// neither condition holds risks a commit to an empty native table that
// vanishes from every mirror-backed read and never reaches the incumbent.
// The SPA hides the affected affordances in overlay, but that cannot bind a
// direct API caller — this guard is the server-side chokepoint, run for
// every principal.

// and a stale 'native' at a capability guard serves a well-formed empty native
// result as an ANSWER — and naming the interface method isOverlayUncached is
// what makes the cached read unable to satisfy it. A bare func type would let
// either guard be wired to the cached resolver in one token, compiling and
// passing. See isOverlayUncached's own doc for what the fresh read costs and

// overlayWriteGuard refuses a mutating REST request whose native module

// provider cannot itself serve that write — those native tables are empty in
// overlay, so an unserviceable write would vanish and never reach the
// incumbent. A write the provider CAN serve (overlay.SupportsWrite) is let
// through to reach a write shadow instead of being refused; a native-only
// record type (never in overlayMirroredTypes) is let through unconditionally,
// since its native table is the live one in overlay mode too. The guarded set
// is keyed off the generated agentPolicies table (the contract's own
// op→tool classification), so it never drifts from the contract. It runs for
// every principal on the REST surface — the reason it is a standalone
// middleware rather than part of the agent-only gate.
//
// REST is the limit of its reach, and deliberately so: the MCP tool registry
// and the automation engine call the same seam verbs without passing through
// any router. The declaration those callers are held to is the provider's own
// (overlay.SupportsWrite, enforced by requireSupportedWrite inside each write
// verb). This guard exists on top of that because it can refuse BEFORE a
// native module handler writes its own table, which the provider — never
// reached on the native path — cannot do.
