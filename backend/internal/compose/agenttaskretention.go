// Retention for the MCP task table.
//
// A completed task stores the VERBATIM tool result its execution produced, for
// the reason the row exists at all: a second poll must be answerable without
// re-running anything. For most of the confirm-first set that result is a whole
// record read-back — a person with their names, e-mails and phones; a deal with
// its amount — so the row holds subject data exactly as the idempotency claim
// body does, and for exactly as long as somebody remembers to remove it.
//
// The window is the task's OWN expires_at rather than a constant here. Past it
// the handle is already unanswerable: Load refuses an expired task, which the
// specification explicitly permits a server to discard. So a row past that
// point can never be read again through any surface, and keeping it stores
// personal data for no purpose at all — which is what Art. 5(1)(e) storage
// limitation forbids.
//
// This is a SEPARATE pass from the idempotency sweep on purpose, even though
// the two do the same shape of work an hour apart. The windows are independent
// and must stay so: folding them would make a change to one silently move the
// other, and the job's name would stop describing what it deletes.
