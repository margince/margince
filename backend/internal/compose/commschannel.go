// The channel half of the send-side resolve (telegram-oa design §8.3) — the
// second cross-module edge comms must not hold itself, wired here beside the
// mailbox half in commsjobs.go.
//
// It is a separate lookup rather than a parameter on the mailbox one because it
// asks a different question of a different table: a mailbox is one HUMAN's grant
// of one connector, while a channel is a bot an admin bound for the whole
// workspace. Only the credential lookup moves off the human, though — the seat
// gate still re-reads the person who staged the message, so a rep without a
// live, mutating seat is refused whichever transport they staged against.

// operator disconnecting the surplus binding repairs every message still pending,

// unit's provider would answer ErrConnectorNotConfigured — a true statement
// about the core that would park a message the installation can perfectly well
// send.
