// Keeping every role on the binding the installation currently holds.
//
// An admin changes the binding through the api. The WORKER is a separate
// process and never sees that write — so without this, re-pointing a lane would
// take effect on one role and not the other, and the two would serve different
// models with nothing saying so. That is the failure moving routing into the
// database was meant to end, and a write surface alone would have reintroduced
// it in a worse form: visible in the UI, and wrong.
//
// So each role re-reads on an interval, the same shape licensecheck.Watcher
// uses for a license renewed in place. Convergence is bounded by the interval
// rather than instant, and that is the right trade here: a routing change is
// rare and deliberate, while a push would need every role to hold a live
// subscription whose failure mode is silence — a role that missed the message
// keeps serving the old binding forever, which is exactly what this prevents.
