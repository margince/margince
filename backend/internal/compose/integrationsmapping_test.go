// The provider-connection PATCH reads its precondition through
// httperr.IfMatchVersion, the one place that decides what an If-Match may say
// (data-model §1.3a: a bare integer, never a quoted ETag). This test exists
// because the first two attempts at this surface got it wrong in both
// directions: one accepted `If-Match: 0` and silently promoted a conditional
// write to an unconditional one, and the next accepted `"7"`, codifying a
// quoted form the contract does not permit.
//
// A conditional write that is silently made unconditional applies exactly the
// overwrite the caller was guarding against, so every value that cannot name a
// real row has to be refused rather than parsed into the zero that means
// "no precondition".
