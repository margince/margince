// Previewing a filter nobody has saved yet (LVS-EXT-9).
//
// A filter builder shows a count that recomputes as clauses change, and until
// now nothing in the contract could evaluate the tree it recomputes for: the
// object list operations take flat scalar parameters and cannot express a tree,
// membership needs a stored list, and the filtered export is audit-logged — so
// driving a live recount through it would write an audit row per keystroke.
//
// It lives in compose rather than in collections for the same reason filtered
// export does: it needs the export's schema-derived projection as well as the
// collections store's engine, and a module may not import a sibling. Sharing
// that projection is also what makes the preview honest — the columns and values
// are the ones the JSON export writes for the same filter, so somebody deciding
// from a preview is deciding about the thing they would get.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do is write: no row, no audit entry, no outbox
// event. That is the property separating it from the export, and it is why the
// operation is human-only — un-logged is right for somebody typing and wrong for
// an agent reading records in bulk.
//
// Why un-logged is defensible at all, stated as the fact rather than the
// intuition: GET /v1/people already returns the same Person projection, 200 rows
// a page WITH a cursor, writing no ledger row either. Preview is strictly less
// capable — 100 rows, no cursor — so it opens no channel a human with read access
// did not have. The export's system_log row is about an extraction ARTIFACT
// leaving the system, which a preview does not produce; it is not a general
// obligation on reading records, or the paged list read would owe one too.
