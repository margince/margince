// The certification case for capture_classify/classify.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from classifyRequest, the same builder the engine calls, and the reply
// is judged by validateClassifyPayload, the same validator the engine applies. A
// case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through
// the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: one label per fixture message, in fixture
// order. Production asks for exactly one label per message, so a per-message
// claim is the only expectation that says as much as the site answers. Position
// is the identity the corpus can name because the ids are minted here and the
// fixture supplies no key of its own — and the obvious candidate, the subject,
// is not unique in a real backlog, so a keyed expectation would be a second
// thing to keep true and one that silently stops matching.
