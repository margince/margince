// The geocoding worker: one company's address becomes a point.
//
// It runs on its own queue at ONE worker, and that bound is the usage policy
// rather than a performance choice. Nominatim holds a client that runs on a
// schedule to four requests a minute, single-threaded, against one service —
// so a second worker would be a second requester however carefully each paced
// itself. The pacer in platform/geocode enforces the interval; the queue's
// max_workers enforces the single thread. Neither alone is enough.
//
// THE TRIGGER IS INGESTION, not a sweep. A company is geocoded when its
// address is written or changed, so the lookups arrive at the rate companies
// are read rather than in a daily burst — which is also why there is no
// backfill job and no daily budget to contend over. Re-reading a website is
// the backfill.
