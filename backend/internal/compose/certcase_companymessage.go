// The certification case for cold_start/company_message — the conversation an
// administrator has with Margince while setting the company up.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from onboardingCompanyAnswerRequest and the reply is judged by the gate
// newOnboardingCompanyGate builds, both of which the assistant uses for the same
// turn. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green
// through the change that breaks the original.
//
// This site is MULTI-TURN, and the kind names the conversation rather than the
// number of calls: the model is stateless, so the whole prior conversation is
// replayed as messages of the ONE request this site sends. The case replays
// exactly the turns the transport would have replayed, through
// companyReadConversation — the same mapping, which is also the bound on how many
// turns a call may carry.
//
// What separates it from the dossier conversation it shares a validator with is
// the wizard state, and that state reaches the AUTHORIZATION as well as the
// prompt:
//
//   - next_required_field is the question the product just asked, so a bare
//     answer that names no field at all — "Acme Robotics" — is a correction to
//     THAT field and to nothing else.
//   - a clicked clarify option grants exactly its field with its value verbatim,
//     which is the strongest explicit instruction this conversation has.
//
// Both are grants the dossier conversation has no way to make, and a grant is
// what stands between a change the administrator asked for and one that arrives
// at the confirm-first queue wearing their request. So the case's gate is built
// from the fixture it sent, and never from anything else.
//
// The conversation context arrives assembled rather than as the identity and
// people stores it came from, because the certified thing is the prompt built
// from it, not the database read that produced it. What that read guarantees
// about it — the dossier's numbering and bounds, and the completion plan the
// draft implies — is enforced at Prepare instead, so a fixture outside it
// describes a call the product cannot make.
