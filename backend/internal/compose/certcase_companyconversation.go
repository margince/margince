// What the two company conversations owe their certification cases in common.
//
// The dossier conversation and the onboarding company conversation are separate
// sites — different prompts, different authorization, different bounds on what a
// fixture may say — but they answer in ONE reply vocabulary, judged by ONE
// validator behind companyReadGate. So what a scenario may assert about a reply,
// what makes an assertion unreachable, and how a run is scored are the same
// question twice, and the answer lives here rather than in whichever site
// happened to need it first. A copy of a shared answer drifts, and the copy that
// drifts is the one that stops failing.
//
// Each site supplies its own name for the refusals, because a corpus author
// reading "the fixture is not one this site takes" needs to know which site.
