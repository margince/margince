// Reading a dossier that already exists, and never writing one.
//
// Get is the surface a person opens: a cache miss there means assemble it, and
// assembling costs a model call. A DRAFTER wants the same facts and must never
// pay that price — a rep pressing "Write email" is not asking for a dossier,
// and a drafting screen that stalls behind one has spent the workspace's budget
// on something nobody requested.
//
// So this is the read half alone. Cold cache answers nothing, and the caller
// writes a draft without those facts, which is exactly what it did before the
// field was fed at all.

// CachedSentencesMax bounds what a draft may take from a dossier.
//
// A dossier is a page somebody reads; a draft is three short paragraphs. Handing
// the whole thing to a drafter buys prompt tokens and invites the model to write
// an essay about the company back to the company.

// CachedSections is what this account is known to BE, from a dossier already
// assembled for this reader — or nothing.
//
// It never generates. A cold cache, an unreadable payload and a stale
// fingerprint all answer empty, and the caller drafts without these facts. That
// is the guarantee stated as a dependency: this function reaches the cache and
// the row scope, and there is no lane here for it to call.
//
// Two halves of Service.Get's usable() test, treated differently and on
// purpose. The stored VERSION is checked: a payload written in a shape this
// build does not understand is a correctness question, and reading it would
// hand a drafter fields that mean something else. The FINGERPRINT is not: it
// says the source facts have moved since the dossier was assembled, which makes
// it stale for the page that presents it as current knowledge, and still true
// enough for a sentence of background in a draft the rep reads before sending.
// Computing it would need BuildInput over the whole record — the work this
// function exists to avoid.
//
// What that costs is bounded by what a caller may do with it: these sentences
// are background in a draft a human edits, never a fact the product asserts on
// its own. A drafter is not a place to learn something new about a company.
