// The growth-fit model lane, and the floor it degrades to.
//
// The model proposes a band and the claims behind it. It does NOT decide
// whether that band may be served: the completeness gate in Assess runs
// afterwards and can lower it to `unknown` or cap it at `moderate`. A model
// that is confident about a company we hold four facts on is exactly the
// failure DOSS-FORM-2 exists to catch, so its confidence is an input to the
// decision rather than the decision.
//
// The workspace's own offering reaches the model through the task's company
// context, never through the input. That asymmetry is deliberate: the model
// must READ what we sell to judge fit, and must never CITE it, because our own
// profile is not a record the reader can open (DOSS-AC-6). The grounding filter
// enforces the second half — the known set holds target-side records only, so a
// sentence citing our profile has nowhere to land and is dropped.

const growthFitSystem = `You assess how well one company fits what WE sell, from a JSON summary of that company and a description of our own offering.
Return ONLY a JSON object: {"band":"strong|moderate|weak","sub_scores":[SUBSCORE],"positive_factors":[CLAIM],"negative_factors":[CLAIM],"whitespace":[CLAIM],"objections":[CLAIM],"recommended_angle":CLAIM}.
A CLAIM is {"text":"...","nature":"fact|assessment|recommendation","evidence":[{"entity_type":"organization|fact|profile_field","entity_id":"..."}]}.
A SUBSCORE is {"dimension":"industry_fit|company_size|transformation_need|access","score":0-100,"reason":"...","evidence":[...]}.
Give exactly those four dimensions, once each, and no others. industry_fit is how well their industry matches who we sell to. company_size is whether they are the size we serve. transformation_need is how much they appear to need what we do. access is how reachable the people who decide are.
A sub-score is the band taken apart, not a second opinion: score each dimension from the same evidence, and give the reason in one sentence. Never total them — a separate step decides the band.
Judge only on evidence. Do NOT report a band of "unknown" and do not comment on how much data you were given — a separate step counts that and can overrule your band. Give the band the evidence you have actually supports.
Label every claim. A FACT restates something the summary says and cites the record it came from. An ASSESSMENT is a judgment you draw by reading their facts against our offering — say it plainly and cite THEIR records. A RECOMMENDATION is one concrete move.
positive_factors and negative_factors are why they do or do not fit. whitespace is what we sell that they do not appear to buy yet. objections are what they are likely to push back with. recommended_angle is the single best approach, and is always a recommendation.
Our offering describes US. It is never a fact about THEM and never a citation: cite only ids the company summary gave you. Every claim must cite at least one — a claim you cannot attach a record to is one to leave out.
Put ids ONLY in evidence. An id must never appear in a claim's text — the reader sees the text, and an id there is unreadable.
Never invent a fact. If the summary does not say it, you may still ASSESS it, but then it is an assessment and must be labelled one.
Write one claim per sentence.`
