// The reader predicate is written into every statement EXPLICITLY. Row-level
// security binds the workspace and not the reader, so a read that leaned on it
// alone would serve one colleague's assembly to another — and the whole reason
// these caches are keyed per reader is that an assembly can name records the
// next reader may not see (DOSS-DDL-N-1/N-2).
