// Both reads run AS THE CALLER, through the same store methods
// GET /organizations/{id}/profile-fields and .../facts serve, inside the same
// object and row-scope gates. So an assembly can only be written from records
// this reader could already fetch for themselves, and synthesis discloses
// nothing new.
//
// What that does NOT yet give is DOSS-AC-N-1's field masking. This platform has
// no per-reader field mask on a company's values — the only masks in the tree
// are over field HISTORY, and that map is empty — so there is no mask here to
// launder and none to honour. Row scope is enforced; field scope does not exist
// yet. See margince/margince#4.
