// The receipt behind one cited record (DOSS-WIRE-3).
//
// A generated sentence carries the records it was written from; this is what a
// reader gets when they open one. It is the whole reason the surfaces above are
// allowed to write prose at all: a sentence nobody can check is worth less than
// the fact it paraphrases, and this is where checking happens.
//
// The rule this file exists to keep is that a receipt never invents. Each
// provenance kind owes its own identifying fields, and one that cannot be
// filled is NAMED in `gaps` rather than sent as an empty string — because an
// unrecorded canonical URL and a recorded empty one read identically otherwise,
// and only one of them means the reader has nowhere to go.
