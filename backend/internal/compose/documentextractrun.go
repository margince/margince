// What one reading of one document does, from claiming the run record to
// closing it.
//
// The division of labour with documentextract.go is: that file owns the
// question put to the model and what may come back, this one owns the run — the
// claim, the lane, and the three outcomes a rep can be shown. Keeping the
// outcomes here is deliberate, because the difference between them is the
// product: "still reading", "read it and it states none of them", and "could
// not read it" must never collapse into one another (RD-AC-N-2).
