		rateRefreshQueue: {MaxWorkers: rateRefreshMaxWorkers},
		// The AI-backed capture passes make serial model calls, so a
		// fanned-out fleet of them would occupy every default worker and
		// delay sends, Telegram polls, and capture syncs. Same species as
		// deep reads — long and model-bound — so the same posture.
		aiCaptureQueue: {MaxWorkers: aiCaptureMaxWorkers},
		// Reading a transcript is one long model call, and a rep is watching a
		// spinner for it. Its own pool for the deep-read reason, and separate
		// from ai_capture because that queue's passes are background sweeps
		// nobody is waiting on: sharing would let a fanned-out capture run put
		// an interactive reading behind it.
		transcriptReadQueue: {MaxWorkers: transcriptReadMaxWorkers},
		// ONE worker, and it is the usage policy rather than a performance
		// choice. Nominatim holds a client that runs on a schedule to four
		// requests a minute, single-threaded, against one service — so a second
		// worker would be a second requester however carefully each paced
		// itself. The pacer enforces the interval; this bound enforces the
		// single thread. Neither alone is enough.
		geocodeQueue: {MaxWorkers: geocodeMaxWorkers},
		// ONE worker, for the geocode queue's reason rather than a performance
		// one. A technical lookup asks three free public services, and the
		// certificate log in particular is a single small service running on
		// goodwill. The pacers in platform/dnsread and platform/certlog hold
		// the intervals; this bound holds the single thread, because a second
		// worker would be a second requester however carefully each paced.
		technicalLookupQueue: {MaxWorkers: technicalLookupMaxWorkers},
		// Overlay reconcile is SERIAL by design. overlaybudget.ConsumeSearch
		// counts but does not pace, and its keys are per workspace, so it
		// cannot bound a provider-level burst: a concurrent fan-out could
		// exceed the incumbent's per-second Search limit. Each workspace
		// still gets its own job row, which is the observability this phase
		// is after; per-workspace PARALLELISM is not.
		overlayReconcileQueue: {MaxWorkers: 1},
		// A full batch of sequential calls to endpoints this deployment
		// does not control: long and outbound-bound, so the same posture
		// deep reads take (webhookRetryQueue).
		webhookRetryQueue: {MaxWorkers: webhookRetryMaxWorkers},
		// A batch of agent runs, each entitled to the full RunWallClock —
		// the longest pass in the tree (agentSchedulerQueue).
		agentSchedulerQueue: {MaxWorkers: agentSchedulerMaxWorkers},
		// A full batch per policy, each record its own multi-statement
		// audited transaction — minutes of database-bound work per tenant
		// (privacyRetentionQueue).
