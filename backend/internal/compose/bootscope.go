// The context a boot-time ledger write runs under.
//
// A boot step that records an operational fact — which extensions this binary
// composed, which release it was published as — writes to system_log like every
// other ledger row, which means it needs the three things every ledger write
// needs: the workspace the row belongs to, an actor to attribute it to, and a
// correlation scope. No request supplied any of them, because no request caused
// the write, so the boot has to bind them itself.
//
// Spelled once because the pre-bootstrap case is the subtle half: an
// installation with no organization yet has no workspace to record against, so
// there is nothing to write and nothing to compare — a boot step must treat that
// as "not yet", never as an error and never as an empty answer it then acts on.
// The integration lane covers that arm for both facts.

// bootLedgerLock is the transaction-scoped advisory lock a boot observation takes

// without it each transaction reads the same previous observation and every one
// of them writes the change.
//
// ONE statement for both facts, parameterized by the fact's name. The workspace
// this key used to carry went with ADR-0091 §5: an installation serves one
// organization (ADR-0061), so it distinguished nothing.
//
// It keeps a NAMESPACE prefix rather than hashing the bare fact name, because
// the workspace suffix was doing that job too. hashtext over an unqualified
// caller-chosen string shares one key space with every other such lock in this
// tree, and a collision there serializes two unrelated boot paths for the
// length of a transaction.
//
// It reads no GUC, so there is no unset-GUC case to guard: the argument is a
// compile-time literal joined to a caller-supplied fact name, and neither can be
// NULL. That matters because pg_advisory_xact_lock is STRICT — a NULL argument
// takes NO LOCK and returns NULL rather than raising, which is a guard reporting
// success while holding nothing. The workspace-qualified form this replaced
// could reach that state; this cannot.

// immutability trigger makes clearing them impossible, so those rows are still
// there and the read can no longer tell them apart.
//
// So the observation says which installation made it. A row without the marker
// is not assumed to be ours — it predates this and may be a predecessor's — and
