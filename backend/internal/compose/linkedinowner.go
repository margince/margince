// Running the LinkedIn matcher under each ghost owner's OWN authority
// (ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// The matcher decides which of a member's imported connections is which
// contact, and a match is reported back to that member. So the question it
// answers is not "does this contact exist" but "can THIS member see this
// contact" — and the answer has to come from that member's live row scope.
//
// The background passes (the event consumer and the hourly sweep) have no
// human, so they used to run as a SYSTEM principal. A system principal is
// unbounded by design — provisioning, the relay and the privacy engines have to
// read every row — which made auth.ScopeClauseFor return an empty clause and
// left the match unrestricted. That turned a one-row CSV into an oracle: upload
// a guessed address, wait for the sweep, and read match_status to learn whether
// a contact with that address exists somewhere the member cannot reach.
//
// So the passes enumerate the OWNERS with ghosts and run once per owner under
// that owner's resolved authority. It costs one RBAC read per member with an
// import — a handful per workspace — and it is the only shape in which the
// answer is the same whether a human or a timer asked.

// ghostOwners lists the members of the bound workspace who have imported
// connections that are still undecided.
//
// Read under whatever principal the caller holds — it names members, not
// records, and the roster is readable by any authenticated member. Only
// undecided ghosts count, because a workspace whose queue is clear should cost
// one query rather than one query per member.
//
// UNDECIDED means the MATCHER has not settled it — `unmatched` or `suggested`.
// It deliberately does not mean "no human has settled it", and the difference
// matters: the ghost row records only the matcher's outcome plus `confirmed`,
// which the accept effect writes back. A REFUSAL is not written here at all —
// it lives in the approval, which is where this design puts the pending state,
// and StageUnlessDeclined is what consults it. So this enumeration also reaches
// members whose every question has already been refused, and the staging pass it
// feeds correctly proposes nothing for them.
//
// Enumerating `unmatched` alone was narrower than the work. An owner whose
// ghosts had ALL been matched to `suggested` was never reached, so a suggestion
// that missed its proposal had no later pass that could rescue it and stayed
// invisible for the row's lifetime.
