// dispatcherLiteralFloor guards against a vacuous pass. Twenty-four dispatcher
// types exist today; the floor sits at eighteen so retiring a few passes does
// not drag the gate along, while a walk that matched nothing — a rename of the
// args types, a parse that silently found no files — still trips it.
//
// What this gate does NOT see, stated so nobody reads more into a green run
// than it earns: it walks this package's own top-level product sources, so a
// dispatcher value built in a subpackage, in a cmd, or through a helper that
// returns river.JobArgs is outside it. Those are not idiom here — every
// dispatcher in the tree is a bare args struct constructed in this package —
// and the enqueue door itself is held separately, by the generated closed
// union that refuses an undeclared args type and by forbidigo's ban on a
// direct river.AddWorker.
// FALLING WITH THE COLLAPSE. ADR-0103 is retiring the workspace dispatchers
// one batch at a time, so this number goes down as the pair count does; it
// bottoms out at the fan-outs that stay, which are the ones over a CONNECTION
// or a BUILD rather than a workspace. It is a floor and not an equality for
// that reason — it stops the walk passing on nothing without pinning a number
// that a sanctioned retirement has to come back and edit.

// TestNoScheduledDispatcherIsEnqueuedByHand — a dispatcher's args type is the

// a pass over EVERY workspace in the installation, so a caller that meant "run
// this for the tenant in front of me" runs it for all of them, and N tenants
// hitting the same trigger run the fleet N times. The intent reads local at the
// call site and the effect is fleet-wide, which is why this is a gate rather
// than a review note: nothing about the enqueue looks wrong.
//
// The one sanctioned exception is DERIVED, not listed: a dispatcher whose
// declared cadence is on_demand has no clock, so a call site is the only thing
// that can ever place it — embed_reindex, which a human's confirm enqueues.
// Give a kind a cadence in api/jobs.yaml and its hand-enqueue sites fail here
// on the next run.
//
// What a caller wants instead is almost always the CHILD kind for the one
// workspace it knows about, enqueued through oneOffChildOpts so it carries the
// declared queue and attempt cap without being counted as a fleet pass.
//
// All three ways of producing the value are walked — a composite literal, a
// var declaration, and new(T) — because they reach the same Insert and a gate
// that saw only the first would be green about the other two.
