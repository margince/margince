// The certification case for brief_ranking/rank.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from briefs.RankRequest, the reply is read by briefs.ParseRankOrder and
// bounded by briefs.BoundToCandidates — the same three the ranker itself runs,
// because the ranker was changed to call them. A case that rebuilt any of them
// would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks
// the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the deals that must LEAD the re-ordered
// queue, best-first, named by the labels the fixture gives them. It is a prefix
// claim, not a whole order — a rep acts on the top of their morning queue, and
// pinning the tail would fail a good re-order for disagreeing about the deal
// nobody was going to open.
//
// It is deliberately NOT "the result is a permutation of the candidates".
// BoundToCandidates already guarantees that for every reply, including one that
// says nothing at all, so a scenario asserting it would pass forever without the
// model contributing anything. The two things production does not guarantee are
// the ones this case measures: WHICH deals lead, and whether the model returned
// a complete order on its own rather than one the ranker had to repair.
//
// The fixture names its candidates by LABEL and never by id. Production takes
// each id from a deal row, and the model is being asked to return those ids
// back — so an id supplied by the corpus would be an id whoever authored the
// expected reply could write into it, and a model echoing one it was handed
// would be indistinguishable from one that ranked the right deal. Prepare mints
// the ids, the labels stay corpus-side, and the prompt therefore stays what it
// is: ids and numbers, nothing a human wrote.
