// What approving an automation's staged action actually does.
//
// Rejecting one has always terminated its run. Approving one did nothing at
// all: the effect never ran, and the run stayed in requires_approval forever,
// so a human who pressed Approve got a card that vanished and a firing that
// still reads as waiting for them.
//
// Underneath that was a worse one. Two of the kinds an automation can stage had
// no decision-grant mapping, and requireDecisionGrants fails closed — so those
// stagings were hidden from every inbox and could not be decided by ANYBODY.
// The census gates in approval_kinds_test.go hold the registries to each other;
// these run the whole path against a real database, because a mapping can be
// present and the inbox still not show the card.
