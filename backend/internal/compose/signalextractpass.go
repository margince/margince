// What one reading pass did, and when it must stop doing it.
//
// The pass drives the queue: it takes the conversations that are due and reads
// them one at a time, and it decides when to stop. Its work is bounded twice
// over — by the conversations the queue offers, and by the time the scan job
// has left. This file owns both bounds and the report a caller logs;
// signalextract.go owns one conversation's reading.

// them apart — and the second is the one somebody has to act on.
