// Replay governance (API-CC-8): a replay is a read, so a recorded body only
// goes back on the wire if the caller can still see the record it carries.
// Without this a stored response is a receipt that outlives the authority it
// was produced under, and "revocation denies the next request" stops being
// true of the retry — a rep whose grant or ownership is pulled would keep
// collecting the frozen snapshot for the rest of the 24h window.
//
// This table is also the replayable set itself: presence here is what makes an
// operation replay-safe, so the promise cannot be granted without someone
// answering what governs it. Whatever a route does NOT re-check carries its
// reason in the same entry — never silently.
