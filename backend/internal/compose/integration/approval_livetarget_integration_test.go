// A staged approval is a decision someone still owes about a record. When that
// record is not there — never was, or archived since — nothing is owed: the
// release would refuse, and the row's summary and proposed change describe a
// record no surface serves any more. So the target probe never skips existence,
// for any seat.
//
// The seat that makes this a gate rather than a happy path is the UNBOUNDED one.
// The row-scope clause is what carries the target id into a query at all, and for
// a table with no capture privacy an all-scope human's clause renders EMPTY — so
// a probe that reads an empty clause as "admitted" asks nothing, and the target's
// absence stops being observable for precisely the seats that can act on the
// most. Art. 17 is the same hole with teeth: erasure anonymizes a record IN
// PLACE, stamping archived_at while leaving owner_id alone, so a scope-only probe
// answers "still yours" for a tombstone.

// live probe adds it, and an offer, whose arm resolves the deal it hangs off and
// so has TWO rows to require live.

// `archive_record` against `deal`, `activity` and `offer` are the staged shapes
// of DELETE /v1/deals/{id}, /v1/activities/{id} and /v1/offers/{id}. A pair no
