// The retention pin for channel correspondence: a message-kind activity is
// subject to retention exactly as a mail one is.
//
// The property is FREE today — the `activity/` selector filters on no kind, and
// the statutory floor shields every kind but task and note — and nothing
// asserted it. Adding a kind filter to that selector would keep every channel
// conversation forever while mail was purged on schedule, and no test would
// fail. It rides the fixture and the policy seed in retention_integration_test.go.
