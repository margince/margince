// The governance hole, proved closed through the wired registry rather than
// against the resolver alone.
//
// A unit test can only show that the resolver decides correctly once it is
// handed both endpoints. What it cannot show is that the registry actually
// READS the deal's current stage on the way — the half that was missing, and the
// half a future edit could drop while every unit test stayed green.
//
// So this drives compose.NewRegistry against a real database, as an AGENT
// principal (the confirm-first tier gates agents; a human is admitted by RBAC
// and would prove nothing about the gate).
