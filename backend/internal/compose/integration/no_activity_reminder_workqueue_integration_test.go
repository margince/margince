// AUTO-AC-6 end to end ("Sam turns on 'no activity for N days', and the
// reminder task lands in his work queue", features/10 §1's own worked
// example) — driven through the REAL River `time_scan` periodic job, not
// TimeScanner.Scan called directly. That direct call is already proven by
// Task 14a's own suite (timescan_integration_test.go, same package): the
// scan/dispatch/occurrence-key machinery in isolation. This suite instead
// boots compose.NewJobRunner exactly as cmd/worker does, so the periodic
// pass that actually reaches Sam's reminder is the one wired into the
// real binary, never a hand-called method standing in for it.
//
// Completion is observed on River's own subscription channel
// (SubscribeCompleted, subscribed before Start so the RunOnStart pass is
// never missed) — no time.Sleep, no polling. NewJobRunner wires
// TimeScanner over the real wall clock (compose/timescan.go's
// NewTimeScanner, unlike NewTimeScannerWithClock's injectable one used by
// the direct-Scan suite), so the seeded quiet touch is placed comfortably
// past the threshold relative to time.Now() rather than a pinned instant.
//
// Sam authors this automation himself (owner_id = Sam), which routes the
// firing through the Task-13 match-time gate (automation/gate.go): the
// gate re-resolves Sam's LIVE RBAC through identity.Service, the real
// resolver compose.NewWorkflowEngine wires in — not the harness's
// synthetic principal.Permissions used elsewhere for read-side scope
// checks. So Sam needs an actual role + role_assignment row, seeded
// below, or the gate blocks his own automation as a lost permission.
//
// "Sam's work queue" is not a bespoke query invented for this test: it is
// the SAME read the built Tasks screen performs today
// (frontend/src/screens/tasks.tsx: GET /activities?kind=task), which
// resolves to activities.Store.ListActivities scoped by
// auth.ActivityDiscoverClause — an activity is discoverable to a viewer when ANY
// entity it links to is visible to that viewer. A deal is an identity table,
// readable by every human seat holding the deal grant, so the reminder task
// on Sam's deal is discoverable workspace-wide: Sam's own read must surface
// it, and so must an unrelated rep's identical read — the same clause that
// would hide a task linked only to a capture-private contact.
//
// A known gap this suite deliberately does not paper over: the OpenAPI
// contract also declares an `assignee_id` filter on this endpoint ("Open
// tasks for an assignee", crm.yaml) for the still-`status: planned`
// personal-queue epic (subsystems/tasks-and-work-queue.md), but neither
// crmcontracts.ListActivitiesParams.AssigneeId nor
// activities.ListActivitiesInput carries it through to a WHERE clause —
// and no clock handler stamps assignee_id on the task it creates
// (handlers_clock.go's taskCreateEffect carries no assignee_id
// key at all). Sam's reminder reaches him ONLY because he owns the deal
// it is linked to, never because anyone assigned it to him. See the
// task-17 report for the full writeup; that gap is out of THIS suite's
// scope to close.
