package overlay

// Connect reaches the incumbent twice before it answers — for the portal id the
// webhook binding needs, and for the owners directory mirror_user_map is seeded
// from — and both are best-effort by design: an admin who has just pasted a
// valid token must not be told the connection failed because a vendor was slow.
//
// That tolerance had no test. It was covered by accident: the lane dialled
// api.hubapi.com for real with a fixture token, HubSpot answered 401, and the
// swallow path ran on every single connect in the suite (#1996). Removing the
// dial removed the coverage with it, so this states the property deliberately —
// and states it over the incumbent the composed server binds ITSELF, with no
// resolver override, which is the one arrangement no other test in this package
// exercises.
