// the production registry advertises must, for an overlay-mode workspace,
// either behave as it does natively or answer the DECLARED
// unsupported-by-SoR sentinel. What it must never do is query the native
// tables — which hold none of that workspace's records — and present the
// resulting empty answer as a successful result. "No deals are slipping" and
// "this report returned zero rows" are the exact failure this criterion
// exists to forbid, because neither is distinguishable from a true answer.
//
// The unit specs for the guards themselves live in
// compose/nativeonlytools_test.go. This suite asserts the guards are
// actually WIRED, by driving compose.NewRegistry — the same constructor
// cmd/mcp and the api role use — against a real overlay-mode workspace. A
// future edit that unwires a guard keeps those unit specs green and turns
// this one red.
