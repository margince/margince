// The write-shadow story (compose/overlaywriteshadow.go), proven over the
// real HTTP surface + a real migrated Postgres: an ordinary REST update or
// archive against a workspace in overlay mode routes THROUGH to the
// incumbent and answers with the re-mirrored row. The overlay-mode write
// guard (compose/overlaywrite.go) admits a mirrored-type write the whole
// way to a handler on the promise that a shadow serves it
// (overlaymod.SupportsWrite); a supported write with no shadow falls through
// to the native module handler's promoted method instead and commits to
// the empty overlay-mode table — this file is what proves that promise
// holds for every write the guard admits.
//
// Every test here connects the workspace through compose.WithKeyvault (so
// Connect can seal a credential and the guard sees an active connection),
// then overrides the live-incumbent resolver with compose.
// WithOverlayIncumbentResolver pointing at an overlay/fake.Adapter — no
// mocked provider and no real HubSpot account: the fake stands in for the
// adapter WithKeyvault would otherwise build from the connection's own
// region+token.
//
// "No network call" used to be asserted here and was not true — Connect
// reached api.hubapi.com twice per test through the Service's own factory,
// which this resolver does not reach (#1996). It is true now, and by
// construction rather than by claim: under this build tag compose binds a
// refusing incumbent (compose/overlayincumbent_refusing.go), and a HubSpot
// client built anyway cannot leave the machine
// (overlay/hubspot/httpclient_integration.go).
