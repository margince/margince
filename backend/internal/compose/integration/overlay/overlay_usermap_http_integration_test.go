// The admin user-map remedy loop, end to end over the composed overlay
// service and a real migrated Postgres. Overlay visibility is fail-closed:
// a user with no mirror_user_map row sees nothing at all. So an admin whose
// email matches no incumbent owner lands in an empty CRM, and until the
// user-map surface existed the only way out was an edit against the
// database. This proves the whole way out — the surface names the reason,
// the pin restores the records, the unmap takes them away again — and,
// last, that a deliberate unmap SURVIVES the automatic email-matching sweep
// that would otherwise re-map the admin behind their back.
//
// The fake incumbent stands in for HubSpot at both seams it is needed at:
// as the Incumbent the owners directory and the backfill are read from, and
// as the OwnerEmailResolver the email-sourced mapping is verified against
// (stubOwnerEmails, this suite's other resolver, always answers "" and so
// could never let the sweep match anyone).
