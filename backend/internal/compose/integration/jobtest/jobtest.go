// Package jobtest is the ceremony every job fan-out suite shares: a River job
// runner subscribed before it starts, and the awaits that read River's event
// stream instead of polling a table. Each converted pass asserts the same three
// things about itself — one row per tenant, each naming its tenant on the wire,
// and only the failed tenant's row failing — so the reading of River's events
// belongs here rather than once per suite.
//
// It is a package of its own for the reason apptest is, and the reason is narrower
// than it first looks. Building a runner needs compose, and a NON-TEST file in
// package integration may never import compose — compose's own white-box tests
// import integration, so that would close a cycle. Test files there import compose
// freely; it is only the non-test file that cannot, and a non-test file is exactly
// what a sibling package is able to import. Suites on both sides of that line use
// this, so everything here is exported.

// (--runner-interval, --retention-interval, --webhook-retry-interval), which are
// the likeliest miswiring of all. The bound is on the GAP
