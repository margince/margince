// Every account-scoped producer, run against the shape capture actually writes.
//
// This is a fitness test, not a feature test: it owns no behaviour of its own
// and asserts nothing about what any producer concludes. It seeds ONE workspace
// the way a connector does — mail filed against a PERSON, the account reachable
// only through that person's employment, and no direct organization link
// anywhere — and requires that each producer still finds the account.
//
// A fixture that hand-writes a link no connector emits proves the producer
// against data that does not exist: it passes while the producer finds nothing
// on every real workspace, and nothing about the green tells anyone. Seeding
// what the writer writes is the only way a test can fail for the right reason.
//
// A producer added later belongs in this list. The cost of joining it is a
// couple of lines; the cost of staying out of it is a feature that looks
// finished, passes review, and does nothing.
