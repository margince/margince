// What River's encoder actually writes into river_job.args, read back off a
// real Postgres.
//
// A per-workspace read of river_job selects `args->>'workspace_id'` — the
// encoded row, not the decoded Go struct, which would agree with itself
// whatever key the encoder chose. The struct-tag gate over the args types
// reads tag TEXT and stops there, so a tag that gate approves and an encoder
// that shipped some other key would BOTH read green while that query returned
// null for work a tenant really did. No such read exists in the tree to catch
// it, which is why the wire is asserted here directly rather than through a
// consumer.
//
// The claim is a biconditional: a non-null workspace_id means tenant work, a
// null means a dispatcher. A dispatcher therefore rides in the same batch. A
// test that only checked the key appears would pass on a system that shipped
// it everywhere, which is the failure that lets a fleet fan-out be counted as
// one workspace's pass.
