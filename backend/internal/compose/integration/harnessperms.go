// The permission fixtures every suite acts through. They live beside the
// environment rather than inside it because they are the one part of the
// harness that has to mirror something outside the test tree: identity's
// seeded role documents. A fixture that drifts from that seed still passes,
// while proving nothing about production.
//
// The row scope is the deliberate exception, and it diverges on purpose. The
// seeded rep and manager are `own`: team membership is not by itself permission
// to rewrite a teammate's records. These fixtures stay `team`, because the team
// arm of the write predicate is still live — a record_grant may name a team, and
// an operator may author a custom role at team scope — and it is these suites
// that cover it. Moving them to `own` would delete that coverage while the
// predicate went on rendering the clause.
