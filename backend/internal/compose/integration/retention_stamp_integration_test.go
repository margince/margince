// The commercial-correspondence stamp (A165/ADR-0114, A167/ADR-0116).
//
// The floor now asks whether an activity is a Handelsbrief — correspondence
// about an actual commercial transaction — and answers from a stamp written
// when the deal concluded, not from a link walked at erasure time. These tests
// drive the REAL winning transition through the deals store, because the whole
// point of the stamp is that it commits with the transaction that earns it: a
// fixture that inserted the column by hand would prove the column exists and
// nothing about the writer.
