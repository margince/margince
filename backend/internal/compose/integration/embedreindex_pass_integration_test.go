// The re-embed is ONE job row that rebuilds the whole corpus. It was one row
// per live tenant until phase D un-scoped the embeddable entities (ADR-0091
// §8), after which every one of those rows walked the SAME table and all but
// the first found each row already fresh at the run's identity. What the suites
// here pin is what survived the collapse: the marker the confirm endpoint gates
// on is claimed by exactly one run, and it comes back on every ending the pass
// has — including the two that never write anything.
