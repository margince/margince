// The wire half of the provenance filter (ADR-0075/A121 §3a). The store-level
// semantics live in compose/capturedbykind_integration_test.go; what is proved
// here is the thing the store cannot see — that an unknown value is REFUSED at
// the edge rather than passed through.
//
// Declaring an enum in the contract does not enforce it: the generated binding
// checks only that the parameter is a string. Without the handler check, a typo
// like `captured_by_kind=ai` builds a clause that matches nothing and returns
// an empty page, which reads exactly like "no AI created anything here". A
// filter whose failure mode is a confident wrong answer is worse than no
// filter, so the refusal is the behaviour under test.
