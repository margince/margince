// A4b end to end: a mutating tool called twice under one retry key acts once.
//
// Everything below the transport is real — the composed registry, the admission
// gate, the claim table, the datasource seam the replay re-reads through. That
// is the point: the unit tests prove the registry's branches against a scripted
// claim store and the adapter suite proves the row, but only this proves the
// WIRING — that composing the surface installs a claim store at all, and that a
// replay's evidence probe reaches the same provider a live read does. Both are
// silent failures otherwise: a surface with no claim store refuses keys, and one
// with no reader refuses replays, and either reads as "idempotency is broken"
// long after the composition changed.
