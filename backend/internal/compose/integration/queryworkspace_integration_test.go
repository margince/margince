// The executor's own properties are proven next door (queryplan_integration).
// What is proven HERE is the half only the tool has: a plan's refs become
// records through the datasource seam, the envelope says what they rest on, and
// the two-principal property survives that second read rather than being
// established before it. A hydration step that ignored row scope would pass
// every test in the executor's suite and hand one team's records to another.
