// Winning a deal starts the delivery it was sold for.
//
// The project already exists when the deal is won — it has been accumulating
// since `initiative` — so the win is a transition, not a birth. These tests
// drive the REAL winning transition through the deals store and seed the
// project through the REAL project writer, because the whole claim is that the
// phase move commits with the win: a hand-written phase column would prove the
// column exists and nothing about the writer.
//
// The guards matter more than the happy path. A project carries several deals
// over years, phase movement is free-form in both directions, and a naive
// "won implies delivering" would re-open engagements somebody deliberately
// closed and restart work already under way.
