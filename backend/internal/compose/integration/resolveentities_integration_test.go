// resolve_entities as a CLIENT reaches it: through the registered tool, over
// real rows, real RLS and the real row-scope clauses.
//
// The ladder's own properties are proven in the people module, and the
// translation rules are unit-tested there. What only this lane can prove is the
// half the tool owns and the half a unit test cannot fake: the match ladder is
// workspace-wide, so the ONLY thing standing between one team's records and
// another team's agent is the read-back through the datasource seam. A
// hydration step that skipped it would pass every test in the people module and
// answer a rep with a colleague's record.
