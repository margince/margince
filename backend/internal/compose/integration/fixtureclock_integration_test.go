// A suite that freezes the clock must seed against that same clock.
//
// The failure this prevents is a TIME BOMB, which is the reason it is worth a
// gate rather than a code review: it passes on the day it is written, keeps
// passing for weeks, and then fails on a date nobody can connect to a change.
//
// The worked example. `contact_relationship_room_integration_test.go` drove its
// services from a frozen `roomFixedNow` of 2026-08-04 and seeded an activity at
// the DATABASE's `now() - interval '20 days'`. Those are two clocks. Every real
// day that passed moved the seeded row a day closer to the frozen now, so the
// row's apparent age fell by a day a day: nearly 20 days old the week it was
// written, and 6.9 days old on 2026-08-17 — one hour under the seven-day rule
// the gone-quiet rung applies. The suite went red on main with nothing changed
// but the date, and the failing assertion pointed at the dismissal logic, which
// was working perfectly.
//
// The gate is deliberately blunt: no `now()` arithmetic at all in a file that
// names a frozen clock. A fixture whose subject is a time passes it as a
// parameter (SeedRow takes them), derived from the same frozen value the
// service is given.
