// The seat count the entitlement surface reports, against a real database.
//
// Nothing else can prove it. The count is a SQL predicate over app_user — full
// seats that are not deactivated, agents included — and the three decisions it
// makes are the difference between a meter that bills honestly and one that
// bills for access the installation already withdrew:
//
//   a read seat is never counted        A62/ADR-0047: they are unlimited
//   a deactivated seat is not counted   the access is already gone
//   an agent seat IS counted            it acts on the estate like a human
//
// The third rule is unchanged and untested here, for a reason worth stating:
// bootstrap no longer seeds an agent identity, so a fresh installation has none
// to count. The rule belongs to the predicate (identity/seatusage.go) and to the
// resident runner that will land under `is_agent`, not to a row the product
// creates.
//
// A unit test cannot see any of it, and a hand-inserted row would prove nothing
// about the writer: the seats here are the ones bootstrap and the members
// surface actually create.
