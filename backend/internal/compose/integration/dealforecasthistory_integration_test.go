// A forecast moves for two reasons that leave no stage transition behind: an
// amount revised in place, and a close date slipped. deal_stage_history is
// written on creation and on a move and nowhere else, so a forecast
// reconstructed from it reconciles over stage movement and silently omits the
// rest — while presenting itself as the whole answer.
//
// The last assertion here is the one that pins a design decision rather than a
// behaviour: these rows go to their own table BECAUSE five readers hold
// deal_stage_history to its stated meaning, counting rows as movements and
// taking max(changed_at) as "when did this deal last move". If a future change
// folds this write back into that table, stalled-deal detection and every
// automation preview start lying, and nothing else in the suite would notice.
