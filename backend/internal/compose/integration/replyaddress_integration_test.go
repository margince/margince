// Who a reply is addressed to, resolved from a real thread.
//
// The defect this is written against is the one an address resolver makes and
// a greeting resolver cannot: on an OUTBOUND message the `from` participant is
// US, so a rank that simply prefers `from` answers with our own address and
// mails the message straight back to the sender. The greeting beside it can
// afford that mistake — it produces a slightly wrong salutation. An address
// cannot.
