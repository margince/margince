// Fixtures shared between this package's suites and the suite packages split out
// of it. They live in a NON-test file on purpose: a subpackage can import
// identifiers from this package's ordinary files, and nothing at all from its
// _test.go files, so a helper two suite packages need has to sit here or be
// copied into each — and a copied seeder drifts from the one it was copied from.
//
// The bar for moving a helper here is a caller on BOTH sides of a package
// boundary. A helper only one suite uses belongs in that suite, next to the test
// that reads it.
//
// This file must not import internal/compose/integration/apptest: apptest
// imports compose, and compose's white-box tests import this package, so an
// ordinary file here that reaches apptest closes an import cycle. A fixture that
// takes an *apptest.AppEnv therefore belongs in apptest, not here.
