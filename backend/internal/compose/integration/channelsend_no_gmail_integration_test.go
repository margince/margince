// Closes the wiring gap channelsend_integration_test.go cannot see: that suite
// always boots WITH compose.WithGmailCapture, purely to make the connect
// registry — and with it the send pre-flight — exist. On an install with no
// Google OAuth app configured at all, which is exactly a Telegram-only
// deployment and the likeliest shape for hand-testing this feature, that
// registry used to never get built and the pre-flight was absent entirely: a
// reply on a channel the workspace bound no bot for was accepted at request
// time and parked later, instead of refused with the actionable 422 the
// pre-flight exists to produce.
//
// This file composes the server with compose.WithKeyvault ALONE — no
// WithGmailCapture, no WithGraphCapture — and proves both branches of the
// channel pre-flight are live anyway: refuse with no bot bound, admit with
// one. Reverting the fix under test (moving the pre-flight wiring back inside
// WithGmailCapture alone) makes TestSendMessageRefusesWithNoGoogleAppConfiguredAndNoBotBound
// fail, because the reply would then be accepted with no live pre-flight to
// refuse it.
