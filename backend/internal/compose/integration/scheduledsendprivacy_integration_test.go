// What the subject-rights engines owe a message NOBODY HAS SENT YET.
//
// A scheduled send is the one shape of outbound mail that has no activity and
// no delivery row, so every projection built on `activity → comms_outbound`
// misses it by construction. That makes these three cases their own concern
// rather than more scheduling tests: each is about a route the sent-message
// path cannot take.
//
//   - Art. 17 erasure must empty AND stop a pending message. Anonymizing the
//     recipient while the mail still goes out would send erased data.
//   - Art. 15 export must carry it, because a message written to somebody and
//     not yet sent is data held about them.
//   - The blind-copy rule pulls both ways at once: a bcc'd subject sees their
//     own message and must not learn who else was blind-copied. Only a fixture
//     with several blind recipients can show both halves.
