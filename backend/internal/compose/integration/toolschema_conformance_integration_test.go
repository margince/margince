// The load-bearing half of the exact output schemas.
//
// A declared schema nothing checks is a comment, and this surface now declares
// thirty of them. The unit tests prove the DERIVATION is right — that a struct
// tag becomes the wire name a caller reads — and prove the CHECKER is right, on
// documents written by hand. Neither of them can prove the thing a client
// actually depends on: that the bytes a handler produces, against a real
// database, satisfy the schema its tool advertised.
//
// So this suite invokes tools for real and holds each answer to its own schema,
// through the same ResultDefect the dispatcher uses — a second spelling here
// would be a second definition of "conforms", and the one that mattered would be
// the server's.
//
// An empty answer is worth checking and is much of what a fresh workspace
// yields. `{"records":[]}` and `{"records":null}` are one Go value apart and
// only one of them keeps the schema, which is exactly the class of defect a
// hand-built result map used to hide.

// WHY THIS RUNS AS A HUMAN, and what that buys. The confirm-first tier gates
// AGENT principals: a 🟡 call from a passport is staged and answers with an
// approval reference rather than a result, so an agent-driven sweep could only
// ever reach the 🟢 half of the surface. A human principal is admitted by RBAC
// and receives the result itself — which is the document these schemas describe,
// and the same document an agent gets once a human has released the call. So the
// sweep covers the confirm-first tools too.
//
// What it still cannot reach is named rather than implied: the tools whose
// handler needs a seam this lane does not stand up — a live calendar
// (book_meeting), an outbound mail or channel provider (send_email,
// send_message), a crawl runner or model path (enrich), a drafting brain
// (draft_follow_ups_for). Their declared schemas are checked by derivation and
// by the encoder-agreement test in the agents package, but not against a live
