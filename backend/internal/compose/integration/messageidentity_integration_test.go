// The claim this whole path exists to make, proven end to end against a
// provider that behaves the way Gmail actually behaves: it discards the
// Message-ID it is handed and mints its own.
//
// Two things then have to hold, and neither is visible from either side alone.
// The provider's own copy of the message, captured minutes later under the
// identity it minted, must collapse ONTO the send's row rather than land beside
// it — otherwise every sent email appears twice. And the counterparty's reply,
// which roots its thread at the identity the world can see, must attribute to
// the SEND — the row that holds the delivery, the consent purpose and the
// links — rather than to a captured echo that holds none of them.
//
// Everything here is the production object but the provider: the send path, the
// dispatcher, the connector, the reconcile, mailmap and the capture sink.
