package channels

// The Telegram channel acceptance suite (telegram-oa design §12, TG-CR-3's
// AC-TG-1…6). It is the last gate before a real bot is pointed at this code:
// nobody can exercise the live channel until this merges, so every claim in
// these four files is a fact read back out of a real migrated Postgres or off
// the real HTTP router — never a fact about a mock's own bookkeeping.
//
// This file holds the connect-side criterion: what binding a bot writes and
// seals. AC-TG-2's twin — what an unauthenticated delivery is told — has no
// subject any more: ingress polls, so this installation exposes no inbound
// endpoint for anyone to authenticate against. The shared fixture is in
// telegram_fixture_integration_test.go.
