// The mutex between an Art. 17 erasure and the transaction that makes a channel
// record DURABLE — the activity write, not the ingress edge that admitted it.
//
// The ingress edge already took the account's lock, which closes the race for
// raw_capture. It does not close it for the activity: the ingest worker reads
// its raw payload in one transaction and commits the activity in a later one,
// so a whole erasure can run between the two. The activity that then lands
// carries the subject's verbatim message text and their account id, and it is
// reachable by NEITHER erasure selector afterwards — subjectOnlyActivities
// walks activity_link.person_id (the post-commit ensure is refused, so there is
// no link) and unlinkedSubjectMail walks counterparty_email (NULL on a channel
// record). The suppression row then guarantees the identity is never recreated,
// so no later erasure, SAR or retention pass can ever find it again, while the
// erasure's own audit tombstone records a clean scrub.
//
// These cases pin the refusal in Sink.Upsert's own transaction. The lock is
// proved the same way the erasure side is proved next door, in
// channelidentity_erasurelock_integration_test.go: a caller holds the account's
// lock for the whole call and a lock_timeout turns contention into an answer,
// so there is no goroutine, no clock and no ordering to get lucky with.
