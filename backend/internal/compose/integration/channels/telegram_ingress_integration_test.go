// the real worker has normalized it. The fixture is in
// telegram_fixture_integration_test.go.
//
// Every test here drives the whole leg — getUpdates → raw_capture → River → the
// ONE guarded Sink → people — because each claim is about the SEAM: that an
// unmatched sender lands ownerless, that a re-delivered batch converges, that the
// mail ladder never judges a message with no address, and that the capture
// completes on the async path rather than when the poll committed.
