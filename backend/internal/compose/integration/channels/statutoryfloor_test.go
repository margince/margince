// erasure suite that moved out of internal/compose/integration.

// Do not rename this file to anything ending in a GOOS or GOARCH word. Go reads
// the segment before _test.go as an implicit build constraint, so a plausible
// name like jurisdiction_arm_test.go is silently dropped on every machine whose
// GOARCH is not literally arm — the registration then never happens, and the
// suite below reports the missing floor as a missing shield.

// It asserts THIS pack and the span the suites were written against, not merely
