// The full Telegram round trip (telegram-oa design §1, §8, §12): a stranger's
// message arrives at the mounted webhook, becomes a conversation against a
// Person nobody had to create, a rep answers it from that conversation, and the
// answer reaches Telegram.
//
// It is the one test in this suite that crosses every seam at once, and it
// exists because each half can be correct while the join is not: the ingest
// resolves a recipient the send path has to be able to address, the send path
// stages a delivery the worker has to be able to resolve a bot for, and the bot
// it resolves has to be the one the ingress was authenticated against. Nothing
// short of the whole leg can catch a mismatch between those.
//
// The Telegram Bot API is the only fake. The router, the workspace-bound pool, the
// vault, River, the consent gate, the seat check and the dispatcher are the
// ones the api and worker roles run.
