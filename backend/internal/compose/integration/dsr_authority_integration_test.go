// Who may see the data-subject-request queue. A request row names the subject
// who exercised an Art. 15/17 right and records what was decided about them,
// so the queue is the admin's — and an unbounded row scope is not a stand-in
// for that authority. Three seeded roles hold scope `all`, so a gate that
// asked about scope handed the whole queue to read_only, the least-privileged
// role in the matrix.
