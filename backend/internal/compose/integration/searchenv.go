// rather than for the store: the leadscore and export suites reference Store zero
// times, as did the capture and connector suites before they moved out. The name
// records where it was first needed rather than what it is, so read "Search" here
// as the fixture's origin, not as a restriction on who may use it.

// different suite's question (TestASubjectTypeTheCallerMayNotReadIsNeverNamed
// asks it deliberately, by naming its own grants).

// a report resolves the basis it reports money in, so every seeded role holds
// this read and every other report suite's fixture already grants it
