// `x-agent-access: human-only` on a `get:` used to be documentation. The
// admission gate returned early on every non-mutating method, and the
// generated policy table carried no GET keys at all, so the refusal was
// structurally unreachable for the ~37 human-only reads the contract
// declares — attachment BYTES among them, which is where an injected agent
// turns a read grant into bulk exfiltration.
//
// This drives the real HTTP stack with a real passport: the refusal is the
// contract's, and the reads that were never human-only keep working.
