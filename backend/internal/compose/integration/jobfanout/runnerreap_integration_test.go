// What these prove: the tenant's scheduling pass closes a run that was stranded
// in 'running', leaves every run that is still going anywhere, and cannot reach
// another tenant's rows.
//
// The two ways to get this wrong are both worse than not sweeping at all. An
// awaiting_approval run is waiting on a human who may take weeks, and closing one
// discards a decision nobody has made yet. A run at the end of its budget is
// about to write its outcome, and reporting it abandoned is a lie about a
// mutation a human may have approved.
