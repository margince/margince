// The passport cap a verb spends is the CONTRACT's, over real HTTP.
//
// The REST agent gate used to admit any verb with no registered MCP tool
// under `write`, so a passport holding read+write could enrich from a
// third-party website or ship an offer to a counterparty — two egressing
// acts — on a cap that says nothing about leaving the workspace. The verbs
// now carry `x-mcp-tool.scope`, and `principal.ScopeSet.Has` is exact
// membership: `write` does not imply `enrich` or `send`.
//
// The unit suites prove contract↔registry parity. What only this lane can
// prove is the gate: that the missing cap is REFUSED at the wire, with the
// scope sentinel's own status and code, and — the part a "not 200" check
// would have passed on the old code too — that nothing was staged.
