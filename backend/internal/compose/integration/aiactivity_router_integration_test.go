// The router reports the tasks no carrier owns, end to end.
//
// Every occurrence here is BORN through ai.CallMeter.Record — the one writer
// the router's flush calls — and every envelope is READ BACK OUT of
// event_outbox rather than hand-built, so what the consumer receives is exactly
// what production staged. A hand-inserted ai_task_run row would prove nothing
// about either half.
//
// What this covers that the carrier suites cannot: the DEFAULT reporter. A
// carrier is wired one task at a time and its suite proves that one task; the
// router is what makes the other nineteen report at all, and it is the half
// that has to keep working for a task nobody has thought about yet.
