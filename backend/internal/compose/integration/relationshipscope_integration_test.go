// An endpoint the visibility conjunction forgets is an endpoint that leaks.
//
// A relationship owns no owner_id: it is visible when EVERY non-null endpoint is
// visible, which auth.RelationshipEndpointScope renders as one EXISTS per endpoint
// column. That clause is the only thing standing between an edge and the records it
// names — an edge answered to someone who cannot read one of its ends discloses
// that record's existence AND its link to the other.
//
// The clause enumerates its columns, and it has to: each needs the table it points
// at, which no schema introspection supplies. So the hazard is a migration adding a
// sixth endpoint column that the clause never learns about — the edge would then be
// scoped by four of its five ends, and rows reachable through the new one would be
// visible to anyone. Nothing in the unit-test lane can see that, because the column
// list and the clause are the same source.
//
// This gate reads the DATABASE instead: every foreign key on `relationship` that
// points at a row-scoped record table must appear in the clause. It fails on the
// migration, not on the leak.
