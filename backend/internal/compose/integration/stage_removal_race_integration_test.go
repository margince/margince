// The occupancy guard against genuinely concurrent writers. The refusal
// is only a guard if the stage a deal is being bound to is LOCKED by the
// binding write: as a plain read, a deal can resolve a live stage, the
// removal can count zero and archive it, and the deal's own write still
// lands — the FK on deal.stage_id asks whether the row exists, and
// archiving is exactly the operation that leaves it existing.
//
// The invariant asserted is the one that must hold whichever side wins:
// no LIVE deal ever sits on an archived stage. A deal that reached one
// is invisible on every board read, all of which filter to live stages.
//
// Both orderings are PINNED rather than raced for. Left to a bare
// WaitGroup the interleaving is the scheduler's to choose, so whether the
// race ran at all was the machine's decision and not the test's — on a
// host where one side consistently won, this suite failed at its own
// anti-vacuity guard, correctly refusing to report a pass it had not
// earned. Each ordering here is instead held open by a row this file
// locks from its own connection, and the lock the winner takes is
// asserted DIRECTLY with a NOWAIT probe. That turns "the race never ran"
// from a flake into an impossible state: a lookup that failed to lock is
// a failure with its own sentence, not a round that silently did nothing.
