// The three holes review found in #1373's first sweep, pinned as behaviour.
//
// They share one shape and it is worth naming, because it is the shape a
// call-site sweep is blind to: in all three the mutation does not probe the
// shared record AT ALL. A contract inherits its whole row scope from its
// anchor, an approval decision inherits it from the record the effect will
// write, and a revoke inherits it from the record the grant is about — so the
// probe that stands in front of each of them names a table the writer never
// mentions, and no amount of reading the writer would have found it.
//
// Written against behaviour rather than against the probes for the same reason:
// the fitness function cannot see any of these, and says so.
