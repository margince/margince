// AC-MCP-8: an empty result and a withheld result are different answers.
//
// This is the one behavioural claim in the v1 envelope, and it is here rather
// than in a unit test because the thing that has to be true is a property of two
// principals over ONE corpus — the same rows, the same query, two answers that
// must not read the same and must not disclose how they differ. A unit test with
// a stubbed provider would be asserting the arrangement.
//
// The failure it exists to prevent is specific: an agent tells a person a record
// does not exist, when it does and they simply may not see it. And the fix must
// not become the disclosure it replaces — the fact of filtering rides the
// envelope, the SIZE of what was filtered never does.
