// The PERF-1 / PERF-4 record benchmarks: how long the SERVER takes to open a
// record and to save one, measured at the transport the number is published
// about.
//
// Two deliberate differences from perfbench_integration_test.go next door,
// which measures PERF-3/PERF-7:
//
//   - It measures through the BOOTED APPLICATION, not the store. PERF-3 and
//     PERF-7 are query budgets ("search", "context-graph assembly") and a store
//     call is the honest unit for them. PERF-1 and PERF-4 are budgets on an
//     OPERATION a person performs, and their column says "server" — routing,
//     admission, the RLS transaction and serialization are all inside the number
//     a customer is quoted, so measuring underneath them would report a figure
//     nobody promised.
//   - It records into docs/reference/perfbench/ unconditionally, where PERF-3
//     and PERF-7 gate on every run and record only when asked. Both carry the
//     `bench` tag, so no merge gate runs either; `make vet` still type-checks
//     this lane, which is the only reason a file no test lane compiles does not
//     rot.
//
// Run it with `make bench-record`.
