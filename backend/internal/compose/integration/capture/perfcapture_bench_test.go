package capture

// CAP-PARAM-1, measured: from a message's RECEIPT to that message being visible
// on the matched timeline, 60 s p95, "including auto-create + link of new
// participants".
//
// The receipt instant is INJECTED — it is the fixture's own `Date:` header,
// stamped at the moment the message is handed to the connector, which is what
// the chapter means by "integration-tested with a clock assert". Nothing here
// sleeps and nothing waits on a wall-clock deadline; the only real-clock reading
// is the elapsed time being measured, and a budget of 60 s against a path that
// completes in milliseconds leaves four orders of magnitude of headroom, so
// there is no timing this can lose.
//
// Every sample uses a FRESH counterparty on a fresh domain, and the thread shape
// is the one that actually auto-creates: a stranger's first message defers, so
// the budget's "auto-create + link" only happens once the owner's own attested
// reply makes the sender a counterparty (ADR-0072 §1). Measuring a deferred
// message would report the budget as held by the path that does no work.
//
// Run it with `make bench-capture`.
