// The licensed seat ceiling as an admin meets it: the number the entitlement
// screen shows is the number the invite is refused against, and the refusal
// arrives as a verdict a client can act on rather than a server fault.
//
// It runs over the composed api because the wiring is the thing under test. The
// posture reaches identity's seat writer through the composition root, and the
// gap that shape exists to close — a role reporting a ceiling it does not
// enforce — is invisible to any test that calls the service directly.
