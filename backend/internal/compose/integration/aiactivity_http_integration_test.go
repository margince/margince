// The handler reaches the route only because an embedded handler set shadows
// the generated 501 stub, and that shadowing is asserted at COMPILE time
// alone: a handler set that stopped being embedded would still build if the
// stub answered in its place. The stub answers 501, so a 200 carrying the
// contract envelope is the proof that the real handler serves this route.
//
// The second half is the operation's `x-agent-access: human-only`
// declaration. A personal read of what the AI did on your behalf is
// exactly the surface an injected agent would use to learn what it is
// permitted to do unobserved, so the refusal is asserted through a real
// minted passport rather than trusted to the generated policy table.
