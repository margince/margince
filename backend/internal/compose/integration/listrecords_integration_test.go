// A filter that reaches no SQL still answers a well-formed page — of the wrong
// rows. That is the one failure the whole list_records path is built against,
// and it is the one no unit test can see: the schema check passes, the envelope
// passes, the seam is called with the filter in hand, and the rows come back
// unnarrowed because nothing bound it to a predicate.
//
// So the assertion here is exclusion, against a real database: two records that
// differ ONLY in the filtered field, and a list that must return one of them.
