// The §2.4 ladder over the REAL stack: a live Redis counter, a real approval
// row, a real decision by a real human, and the same passport reading again.
//
// The unit suites prove each half against a stub. What only this lane can prove
// is that the halves meet — that the window the gate refused on is the window the
// approval widened, through the actual approvals HTTP surface, with the same
// meter pointer at both ends. Every wiring fault this change could have has the
// same symptom: an approval that reads as granted and an agent that stays
// refused.
