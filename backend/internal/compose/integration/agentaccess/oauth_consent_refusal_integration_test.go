// What a HUMAN sees when the consent flow refuses them. The screen is a native
// form in the SPA, so a JSON refusal replaces it with a body of text on a page
// that has no navigation: the human's flow ends there, with no way back and
// nothing to click. Every refusal a human can cause therefore comes back to the
// screen with a marker naming it.
//
// Whether the nonce comes back with it is the whole distinction between the two
// kinds: a refusal the human's next action can fix keeps the armed pair alive
// (consentScreenRetry), and one that nothing can fix hands back the request
// alone, because a form it could submit would only be refused again
// (consentScreenRefusal).
//
// The refusals a CLIENT causes are unchanged and belong next door: approve and
// deny still answer the client's own redirect_uri (oauth_lend_integration_test.go),
// and a cross-site POST is still refused outright rather than redirected
// (TestOAuthConsentGateBlocksSilentAuthorization).
