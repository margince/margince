// that starts knowing ONLY the MCP URL reaches a working tool call without
// ever leaving this origin. Each endpoint it uses is one the server itself
// advertised, and pathOn asserts every advertised URL against the origin it
// is dereferenced from — so a chain that quietly crossed origins fails here
