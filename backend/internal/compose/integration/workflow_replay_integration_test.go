// AC-W6 (interfaces.md §5): a run's full persisted trace — the
// workflow_run row, its audit_log row, and its event_outbox event,
// linked by the correlation/causation ids the write shape stamps
// (storekit.Audit/Emit, events.md §2) — must let a reader RECONSTRUCT
// the firing: which trigger fired it, what it planned, what it applied,
// and its outcome. This suite fires ONE lead through the real domain
// write path (people.Store.CreateLead, which stages "lead.created" in
// event_outbox), reads that staged envelope back, and dispatches it via
// engine.HandleEvent — the exact call the cg:workflows redis subscriber
// makes once it decodes an envelope off the bus (cmd/worker's
// runSubscriber); no relay, no subscriber needed, since compose cannot
// import the redis client by architectural design (.go-arch-lint.yml's
// compose canUse list has no redis) and that transport hop is proven separately
// by platform/events' own bus integration test. The test then reads back
// NOTHING but the three persisted rows to rebuild the story, asserting
// it matches what the test itself orchestrated. A trace with a missing
// causation_id, a wrong audit_log_id, or a planned/applied encoding that
// does not name the real entity would leave this reconstruction with no
// row to find or a mismatched fact — it is not an assertion-free replay.
