// What an operator sees after they restrict the edge.
//
// `relationship` is a first-class RBAC object because reading an edge discloses
// its endpoints AS A PAIR — a fact neither endpoint's own grant covers. Before
// #1846 the account page answered that fact anyway: an operator who zeroed the
// grant got 403 from GET /v1/relationships/{id}, 403 from the employment list
// and an empty employment section on the person page, so the restriction looked
// enforced everywhere they would check, while the connections graph, the
// contact roster and the per-contact deal roles quietly went on answering.
//
// The census in backend/gates/edgereaders_test.go proves every read CALLS the gate.
// This proves the gate ANSWERS the way an operator would check — and that the
// page says "withheld" through its own channel rather than rendering an account
// with nobody at it, which is the difference between a withheld section and a
// wrong one.
//
// The principal is built in-process rather than PATCHed over HTTP, matching
// TestARoleRefusedTheEdgeObjectCannotTraverseTheEmploymentEdge, which pins the
// same restriction for the query grammar: it is the shape zeroing the grant
// produces, and a role mutated mid-suite would leak into every other test on
// the shared seed.
