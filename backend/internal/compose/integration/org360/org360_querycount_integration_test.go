// The 360 exists to replace a stack of round trips with one. That promise
// is only true if the assembly's cost is flat in the size of the account:
// a per-contact strength read, or a per-deal stage lookup, would turn one
// HTTP call into N database calls and quietly reintroduce exactly what the
// endpoint was built to remove.
//
// So this counts queries rather than milliseconds. A timing assertion on a
// shared CI box measures the box; a query count measures the code, and it
// is the number that actually degrades when someone adds a loop.

	// A ceiling as well as a shape: ten sections, a handful of queries each
	// at most. If this ever needs raising, the reason belongs in the commit
	// that raises it.
	//
	// Raised 25 → 27 for the last_touch section (ADR-0079 arc): it is a new
	// section, and it costs its own grant check and its own read. Two rather
	// than one because the read is gated like every other section — a caller
	// without the activity grant gets silence, not a timestamp.
	//
	// Raised 27 → 28 for next_meeting: ONE query, not the two it would take to
	// read the meeting and then its attendees. The attendees arrive as JSON
	// from a lateral sub-select carrying their own row-scope predicate, so the
	// section stays flat in the size of the meeting as well as the account. It
	// reuses the activity grant the timeline already checked, so it costs no
	// second admission.
	//
	// Raised 28 → 29 for the contacts' internal routes: ONE query for the whole
	// contact set, not one per contact, which is the difference between a
	// composite that costs the same on every account and one that costs most on
	// the accounts with the most contacts. It rides the person grant the
	// contacts section already checked, so it costs no second admission.
	//
	// Raised 29 → 30 for last_meeting_at: ONE query, the most recent meeting
	// that has already happened. It is the opposite question from the
	// next-meeting section — backwards rather than forwards — so it cannot be
	// read off that section's row, and it carries the activity scope clause
	// itself rather than trusting a read that asked something else. It reuses
	// the activity grant the timeline already checked, so it costs no second
	// admission, and it stays flat in the size of the account like every
	// other section here.
	//
	// It landed without this line, so the assembly issued 30 against a budget
	// of 29 and every branch cut afterwards inherited a red gate.
	//
	// 31 since the contracts block (ADR-0109/A160): one more indexed read for
	// what the account is under contract for, gated on its own grant. It is
	// FLAT in the size of the account like every section here — one query
	// whether the company holds one agreement or forty — which is the property
	// this budget exists to protect, rather than the absolute number.
	//
	// 32 since A165/ADR-0114: the activity visibility probe no longer skips
	// the unbounded principal — the availability test (a held record reads
	// as gone, admin included) runs for everyone. One indexed read by primary
	// key, flat in the size of the account.
	//
	// 34 since #1621: the organization read now carries how many people work at
	// the account and how many deals are open on it. Two reads, both issued for
	// the whole organization set at once rather than per row — the counts arrive
	// grouped by organization_id, so they are flat in the size of the account
	// exactly like every section above, which is the property this budget
	// protects. The number moved without this line and the gate went red on main
	// for every branch cut afterwards.
	//
	// 35 since the projects section: one read of the account's unarchived
	// projects under the caller's project row scope, capped at 25 rows and
	// flat in the size of the account.
	//
	// 39 since the writable flag: the organization, its people, its deals and
	// its projects each answer "may this caller change this row" for their whole
	// page in ONE statement — auth.StampWritable over the page's ids, plus the
	// live filter that keeps an archived row from being reported as editable.
	// Four reads, one per record type on the page rather than one per row, so
	// they are flat in the size of the account exactly like every section above.
	// The flatness assertion higher up is what actually protects that; this
	// number only records where the flat cost now sits.
	// 42 since the work-in-flight card: three reads that say why the account's
	// deals and projects need a person — the overdue task per deal, the same
	// per project, and the open commitment they made to us per project. Each
	// is one statement over the whole page's ids, so the cost is flat in the
	// number of deals and projects exactly like the sections they decorate.
	//
	// 43 since the account owes card (#3629): one read of the open promises
	// filed against the account, bounded by its own limit rather than by how
	// many there are — the same statement the next-steps section already ran,
	// asked a second time at a different bound. Flat in the size of the
	// account, like every section above.
	// 44 since the harness's admin gained the `tag` grant the real seed
	// always gave it: one read of the account's tag chips. The section is
	// not new — assemble.readTags has always run for a caller holding
	// tag.read, which every production admin does — so this line records a
	// cost the budget had been blind to rather than a cost just added. One
	// statement for the account's own chips, flat in the size of the
	// account like every section above.
	// 45 since an email says how many files came with it (#3897): one
	// count of the timeline page's attachments, keyed by activity id over
	// the whole page rather than asked per row. Flat in the size of the
	// account like every section above — a page of twenty emails costs the
	// same one statement as a page of two.
