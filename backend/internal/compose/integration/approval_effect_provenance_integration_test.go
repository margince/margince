// A staging's KIND is not a namespace. The REST admission gate stages under
// the operation's tool name, and compose registers approved-effect executors
// under kinds its own proposal flows mint — "enrich" is both. So an agent
// could mint, by hitting a URL, a staging that a human's approve click would
// hand to the compose enrichment executor, over an envelope that executor
// cannot parse. Worse than a failed write: the executor redeems FIRST, in its
// own committed transaction, so the approval was consumed and could never be
// redeemed again, the human saw a 500, and the audit row recorded a
// redemption for an effect that never ran.
//
// Provenance decides instead: a server-side proposal carries no passport, an
// agent-minted one does, and only the former reaches an executor.
