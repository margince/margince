// The record a benchmark run leaves behind, so a number nobody re-ran is still
// readable — and still says what it was measured on.
//
// This is the aicert shape, not the rbac-matrix one, and the difference is the
// whole design. rbac-matrix.md is DERIVED from the seeded policy, so it is
// drift-gated: rendering it twice must produce the same bytes or the gate
// fails. A latency is MEASURED, so rendering it twice never produces the same
// bytes and a drift gate on it would fail every run for everybody. What can be
// held to instead is what aicert holds its records to: say what the number was
// measured on, and never let a missing measurement read like a passing one.
//
// What is deliberately NOT captured: hostname, username, and any filesystem
// path. This record is committed to a public repository, and none of the three
// tells a reader why a number is what it is.
