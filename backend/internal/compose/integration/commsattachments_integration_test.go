// The send-time attachment authority, against a real database.
//
// A delivery is not sent when it is staged. It sits on a retry ladder, and in
// that window a file can be archived and a sender can lose the grant that let
// them attach it. EnsureTransmittable is what re-asks — and it is the ONLY
// thing standing between a withdrawn grant and a file leaving the building
// under the sender's own address.
//
// It had no test at all. The existing send suite wires this adapter and then
// says so in its own comment: "this lane sends no files". So the production
// object was constructed and never asked a question.
//
// A162/ADR-0111 sharpened why that matters. The virus scan used to sit beside
// this check; with it retired, the sender's live row scope is the whole gate.
