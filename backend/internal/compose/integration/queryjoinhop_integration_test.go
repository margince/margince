// The hop that lives in neither record, against real rows and real RLS.
//
// The unit suite proves the derivation and the statement it compiles to. What
// only a database can say is that the statement RUNS — a join edge is the one
// hop form whose subquery names a table the plan's own vocabulary never
// resolved, so a column that is not there is a database error rather than a
// refusal, and a validated plan must never produce one.
//
// The row scope is the other half. A hop is a read of the record it lands on,
// so a caller who cannot see the organization must not be able to select a
// person through it, or the employment table becomes a channel onto rows the
// scope hides. That is what bounds this read — ADR-0091 retired RLS (core 0217)
// and dropped workspace_id from both join tables, so row scope and object RBAC
// are the boundary rather than a tenant predicate.
