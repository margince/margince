// Art. 17 reaches an in-flight job through the row the job NAMES, never
// through river_job. That is the property the whole job-args design rests on:
// args carry an id, so scrubbing the row the id points at neutralizes the
// queued work, and no copy of the subject's data survives in a table with no
// workspace column and no RLS.
//
// privacy_comms_integration_test.go already proves the scrub parks the
// delivery and that the dispatcher's Load refuses it. What it does not prove
// is the last step: that the job which was already QUEUED against that row
// wakes up and transmits nothing. Without this the kill-switch claim stops one
// call short of the thing an operator actually worries about.
//
// The same guarantee for telegram_ingest is proven next door, and more
// sharply, by telegram_sinkerasure_integration_test.go and
// channelidentity_erasurelock_integration_test.go: they pin the mutex between
// an erasure and the transaction that makes a channel record durable, which is
// the harder half of the same property.
