// The ladder assembled through the REAL wiring, from both doors.
//
// The assembler crosses two modules that may not import each other, so the edge
// it depends on is one compose injects. A test that built its own assembler over
// hand-made stores would be testing a copy of that wiring rather than the wiring
// — which is the whole reason these live here rather than beside either module.
//
// Every deny arm below carries its own control over the SAME seed, read by a
// caller who IS allowed. Two absences assert nothing on their own: an empty
// ladder satisfies "no activity id" and "cannot tell" perfectly well, so a test
// checking only those passes just as happily when the read returns nothing.
