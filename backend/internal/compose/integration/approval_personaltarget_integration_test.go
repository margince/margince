// A saved view is per-user state: its store serves it back on `id AND owner_id`
// and refuses every other seat, admin included. So the approval that stages an
// archive of one is decidable by its OWNER and by nobody else.
//
// This is the case that decides which probe the target arm may use. The row-scope
// clause every other owner-carrying table takes admits own/team/AND ALL — so an
// arm built on it would list a colleague's private view, its name and the change
// staged against it, in a teammate's and an admin's inbox, and let either of them
// decide a write the API refuses them the row itself for. The approval surface
// may never disclose more than the record would.
//
// It runs at the store seam rather than over HTTP because that is where this
// package can bind a SECOND real seat: the migrated-database harness seeds three
// humans across two teams, while the HTTP harness bootstraps exactly one admin.
