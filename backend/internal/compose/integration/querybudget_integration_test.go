// What a query plan is allowed to COST (#1847).
//
// A plan's page limit bounds the rows it returns and not the rows it visits: a
// traversal compiles to a LATERAL join re-executed once per outer candidate
// row, so a hop that admits almost nobody makes the statement walk the whole
// outer table before it can fill a single page. The ceiling that bounds that is
// proven here rather than in a unit test, because a SET LOCAL only bounds
// anything on a real statement in a real transaction — and because the same
// corpus has to show the ceiling does NOT cut a legitimate plan short.

// Measured rather than guessed: this corpus answers the plan in ~50 ms, so the

// and the production budget is a hundred times more than enough. Both tests
