// The row fixtures every suite seeds from, split out of harness.go when that
// file crossed the file-length cap (margince/margince#2163).
//
// One concept: put a row in the database and answer its id. Env construction,
// the principal builders and the workspace-bound exec helpers stay next door —
// a suite reaches for exactly one of those three things at a time, and the
// split is along that grain rather than at whatever line the cap fell on.
