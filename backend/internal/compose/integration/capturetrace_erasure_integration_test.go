// Art. 17 reaching the 24-hour capture trace, through the real eraser.
//
// The trace's sweep bounds exposure to a day; it does not ANSWER a request made
// inside that day, and an erasure honoured everywhere except one diagnostic
// table is not honoured. Driven through privacy.Eraser rather than by running
// its DELETE here: a test that pastes the production statement stays green if
// the cascade stops calling it.
