// The MCP-SESS-READS bound on the REST door, over the REAL HTTP stack with a
// real passport.
//
// The shared app harness composes agentvolume.Unmetered() — it serves no Redis,
// and a meter that cannot reach its counter fails closed, which would refuse
// every agent read in suites testing something else. That is the right default
// for those suites and the wrong one for this property, so this file builds its
// own Server with a live bound. Without it nothing would prove the REST door
// enforces the bound at all.
//
// The window is spent by charging the meter directly: that IS a window already
// spent through the MCP door, which is the shape this bound has to answer —
// one credential presenting at a second door must meet the same counter.

// platform/auth refuses on Calls and on agentvolume.CounterFor(spec) — which is

// it catches a half at a time: the mutating half was closed by C2 and the read
// half sat open for a release, because nothing asserted the pair.
//
// Egress is not driven here and is not missing: CounterFor picks between Writes
// and Egress at the SAME charge point (ChargeEffect), so the Writes row proves
// the call site and CounterFor's own tests prove the choice. Reaching Egress
// through this door additionally needs an approval staged and redeemed, since
// every egress tool with a REST twin is confirm-first.
// Each counter is measured across the ONE request that must charge it, not over
// the suite. A total taken at the end cannot say which door paid: a mutation
// answers with the row it changed, so its read-back charges Reads too, and a
// read door charging nothing at all still reads as covered. That is not a
