// What the onboarding company-message case owes the certification lane: it
// issues the request the setup conversation issues — the replayed turns, the
// wizard's own state and the clicked clarify option included — it judges the
// reply with the gate that conversation judges it with, and it separates a reply
// the gate refuses from one that answers the wrong thing.
//
// The gate is the interesting part of this site, and it is why several tests
// below run the SAME reply against two conversations that differ in one wizard
// input. next_required_field and a clicked option are grants: with them a change
// is one the administrator asked for, without them the identical reply is a
// confused-deputy action arriving at the confirm-first queue wearing their
// request. A case whose gate was built from anything but the fixture it sent
// would report the wrong verdict on both.
