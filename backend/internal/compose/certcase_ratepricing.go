// The certification case for rate_extract/pricing.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from rateExtractRequest, the same builder the crawl calls, and the reply
// is judged by acceptRateRows, the same no-guess gate the crawl applies. A case
// that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the
// change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the models the page grounds, each with the
// four price buckets it must carry. Prices are the whole product of this site —
// what reaches an administrator's approval queue is a per-model price — so a
// price is the one thing the model can be right or wrong about. It is a subset
// claim, never an inventory: a real pricing page states more models than a
// scenario cares to pin, and demanding exhaustiveness would fail a read for being
// richer than its author imagined.
//
// Two things the expectation deliberately cannot name. A PROVIDER: the gate
// overwrites every row's provider with the configured source, so naming one could
// only restate the fixture or assert something no reply can reach. A PASSAGE ID:
// the gate already requires that a row cite one, and which passage grounds a
// price is a fidelity question for the rubric — pinning an id in the corpus would
// couple every scenario to the fixture's own line numbering, where one blank line
// renumbers everything after it.
