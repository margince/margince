// The core's half of extension.Core: a unit's governed write onto the
// product's own records, made on the transaction the unit already holds.
//
// Everything here is a translation between two vocabularies and a set of
// refusals. The WRITE is the product's own — activities.LogActivityTx, the same
// entry point the HTTP handler reaches — so the RBAC gate, the row-scope check
// on every link, the audit row, the outbox event and the captured_by stamp are
// inherited rather than re-implemented. A port that re-implemented any of them
// would be a second write shape, which is the thing the tier exists to avoid.
