// The certification case for enrich/signature.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from signatureEnrichRequest, the same builder the pass calls, the window
// comes from signatureBlock, the same derivation the pass shows the model, and
// the reply is judged by gateEvidence and the §2.9 acceptance floor, the same
// two rules the pass applies before it writes anything. A case that rebuilt any
// of them would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that
// breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the contact fields that must reach the
// person's record, with the values they must carry. The pass proposes fields and
// fills only empty ones, so what it is right or wrong about is a field — it
// either grounds the one the scenario named, or it grounds something else, or it
// grounds nothing. It is a subset claim, never an inventory: a real signature
// carries more than a scenario cares to pin, and demanding exhaustiveness would
// fail a read for being richer than its author imagined.
