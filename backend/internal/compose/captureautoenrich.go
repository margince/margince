// The captured-organization auto-enrich sweep (CAP-PARAM-7, ADR-0072/A118):
// a leader-elected periodic pass (run-on-start + daily) that gives every
// company with a primary domain and no dossier a governed web one — however it
// was named, since a person creating one is usually the moment they want it.
// The anchor is excluded; cold start has already read it. Per workspace, when
// the capture_auto_enrich flag is on, it enqueues a deep read
// (system:capture_auto_enrich, auto-applied on completion) for each due org —
// newest first, under an atomically-reserved daily cap. It is the
// self-healing reconciler: the prompt trigger is the organization-event
// consumer (orgautoenrich.go), which queues this same workspace pass the
// moment a company appears, and anything that slips through — the worker
// down, an enqueue lost — is simply picked up next daily pass. The
// deep-read worker's auto-apply lane (deepread.go) records the terminal
// outcome on the sweep's cursor.

// autoEnrichDailyCap is the per-workspace ceiling on auto deep reads started in
// one UTC day. Reserved atomically, so two replicas never both slip past it.
//
// It is the THIRD bound on this fan-out, not the only one, and knowing what the
// other two already do is what sets the number:
//
//   - Concurrency is bounded by deepReadMaxWorkers (2): a burst never occupies
//     more than two workers however long the queue is.
//   - Money is bounded by the ADR-0020 AI budget: background model calls defer
//     to the next window at the monthly cap, whatever this counter says.
//   - And a read only ever happens for a company the workspace CREATED, which
//     the tiered gate allows only for an address the owner has corresponded with
//     or already has a person for. A stranger's mail defers to the ledger and
//     mints nothing, so an outsider cannot aim this at a domain of their choosing.
//
// What is left for this counter is PACING, and 500 is sized for the moment that
// decides whether the product is believed: a first backfill mints hundreds of
// companies at once, and what it is demonstrating is that the CRM fills itself
// (P5). A ceiling below that arrival rate turns the demonstration into a trickle
// and teaches the opposite, while a ceiling above it buys nothing the three
// bounds above do not already give.
