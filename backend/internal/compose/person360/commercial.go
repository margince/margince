// matters now, what money is on it, and who else has to be convinced.

// The role is always what the relationship edge RECORDS. It is never inferred
// from a job title: a CFO is not automatically the economic buyer, and a page
// that guessed would be asserting a fact about someone's authority that nobody
// wrote down.
