// Why this contact needs attention TODAY — one answer, not a list.
//
// The page's opening line is a reason, not a record. "Warm, 73" describes; "she
// replied after 41 quiet days and nobody has answered" is something to do.
//
// ONE MOMENT WINS (ADR-0096 D2). A card offering five reasons has handed the
// choosing back to the reader, which is the work this ladder exists to do. The
// ladder is fixed and ordered by consequence; the first rung that fires is the
// answer, and the rest are not computed into a list nobody reads.
//
// Every moment here is DETERMINISTIC — derived by a rule from captured
// activity, never asserted by a model. Three things follow from that, and all
// three are the point:
//
//	Every moment carries evidence the reader can open. A rule knows what it
//	fired on; a paraphrase does not.
//
//	The page opens on a reason at FIRST PAINT. Nothing here waits on a model,
//	so there is no placeholder state pretending to be an answer.
//
//	A moment cannot be wrong in the way a generated one can. It can be
//	unwelcome — which is what dismissal is for — but it cannot assert
//	something that did not happen.
//
// They are derived from the sections this page has ALREADY read rather than
// from fresh queries. That costs nothing extra and buys an invariant: a moment
// can never cite evidence the page beside it is not showing, and a section the
// caller may not read contributes no moments rather than leaking through one.
//
// Two rungs are input-bound and stay dormant rather than being mocked into
// life: job_change fires only on a RECORDED employment change, and
// public_signal needs a connected data provider. A rule that cannot fire is
// absent from the page, not an empty card.
