// The pass that finds a scheduled message nothing will ever wake.
//
// A scheduled row is armed by a River job and by nothing else. That is the right
// design — the row is the schedule and the job is a dumb alarm — but it has one
// failure the rest of the path cannot see: a job discarded after exhausting its
// attempts, or lost to an outage that spanned the whole ladder, leaves the row
// `scheduled` with no timer. Nothing wakes it, and the rep is told nothing,
// because being told is something the fire path does and the fire path never
// runs.
//
// So this re-arms it. Not "sends it" and not "holds it": it enqueues the alarm
// that was lost, and the ordinary fire path then makes the ordinary decision —
// send it, hold it for consent, hold it as a missed window. A sweep that decided
// anything itself would be a second send path, and the whole design of this
// feature is that there is one.
