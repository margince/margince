// The REST door's half of the governance seam (modules/agents/command.go):
// what turns an HTTP request into the operation's typed command.
//
// The door decodes; it does not interpret. What the approval binds to, and what
// would be refused anyway, come back from the resolver the command is bound to
// — the same resolver the tool door reaches for the same operation. Where the
// contract states a tier outright, the generated policy answers it; where the
// tier turns on the record's own state, the command answers that too
// (agents.DynamicTierInput). Only the inbox line is still this door's own
// (restSummary), and stagedTarget says why.

// restCommandDeps is what a decoder needs to build its command's resolver.
//
// A struct rather than a positional argument because the dependency is per
// FAMILY: the archive reads the record seam, an update_record command will want
// the field-ownership probe, a send the comms seam. Passed positionally, each
// family added would re-sign this map type and every entry already in it — the
// churn a table of twelve identical signatures is least able to absorb.
//
// One struct serves BOTH moments a decoder runs at — resolving a dynamic tier
// before admission, and naming a staged target after a refusal — because it is
// the same decode either way. The tier used to be fed from a struct of its own,
// which is one of the two spellings this seam removed.

	// stages resolves a pipeline stage's configured SEMANTIC, which is what
	// makes a deal move a close, a reopen or a routine step — three opposite

	// written without it (modules/agents/commandlifecycle.go).
	stages agents.StageResolver
	// channels answers whether an activity kind is a messaging-channel
	// conversation. The tool door holds the whole Comms seam and asks it
	// there; this door holds the question alone, because a REST send_message
	// needs to refuse a non-channel anchor without being able to send anything.
	channels agents.ChannelKinds
	// imports reads a staged import run's report, which is what a commit's
	// summary is written from. Same reason `stages` is here: the sentence a
	// human decides on cannot be written from the request alone, and a summary
	// that cannot say what the import does asks somebody to approve a bulk
	// write to their estate sight unseen.
	imports agents.Imports
	// tags reads the two words a merge names, which is what its summary is
	// written from. Same reason `stages` and `imports` are here: a human
	// deciding "fold X into Y" cannot be shown the ids and asked to mean it.

// restCommands maps a crm.yaml operationId to the decoder that turns an HTTP
// request into the operation's typed command, bound to the resolver that
// speaks it.
//
// The table covers the WHOLE agent-reachable mutating surface — all sixty-nine
// routes, one entry per operation, with nothing left to answer from the route's
// own shape (margince/margince#928).
// TestEveryAgentReachableMutatingRouteDecodesIntoACommand derives both
// directions of that from the policy table, so a route the contract adds fails
// there rather than reaching a door that has no answer for it.
//
// Every create and every whole-record patch route is registered, all
// twenty-six — thirteen creates and thirteen whole-record writes. Twelve of
// those thirteen route as PATCH; updateOfferTemplate is a PUT, a full replace
// rather than a field patch, and is the same shape for everything this table
// answers: one routed {id} naming the record the write lands on, and a body
// that is that record's fields. Six of the thirteen create record types (custom_field, list,
// offer_template, product, saved_view, tag) create through their own
// module's handler, never through create_record's own datasource-provider
// write path — but that asymmetry is not this table's to answer for.
// createResolver.Guards (command.go) deliberately asks nothing about whether
// create_record itself "serves" a record type: that question has a
// door-dependent answer (create_record's own Handle cannot express these six
// types; the REST operation that creates one performs it fine through its
// own handler), so it is asked once, at createRecord.StageInfo (tools.go),
// on the one door where it is a fact about the executor rather than about
// the operation. Every whole-record patch route is registered for the same
// reason patch never had that question at all — see patchResolver.Guards'
// own comment.
