// this file is the one-hop rule and the assembly that enforces it.
//
// One hop means one edge from the account. A contact's other employers, a
// deal's other accounts and a partner's own partners are NOT walked: the
// second hop is a different read with a different cost, and a card that
// sometimes went two hops would have no honest cap.
//
// The layout is the browser's work, never the server's — this returns the set,
// not a picture.
