// Package company360 assembles the company record page in one read: profile,
// contacts with their relationship strength, deals, timeline, tags and
// list memberships, decidable approvals, open next steps, and what has
// changed since the caller last acknowledged seeing the account.
//
// It also serves the same page's CONNECTIONS card (graph.go), a second read
// returning the account's one-hop neighbourhood as nodes and edges. Separate
// because a client that wants the profile does not always want the graph, and
// because its unit of authorization is a node group rather than a section —
// but the same posture: one transaction, one instant, per-group grants, and a
// cap that reports what it left out.
//
// It lives in compose because it spans company, contact, relationship,
// deal, activity, tag, list and approval — the composition layer's charter
// — and it durably owns two tables of its own, both per-user view state rather
// than record facts, so both are written without an audit row or an outbox event:
//
//	Tables owned: user_record_view (the per-user visit baseline),
//	              suggestion_dismissal (the rep's "not this, not now").
//
// Two rules shape everything here.
//
// One transaction, one instant. Every section reads inside a single
// database.WithWorkspaceTx and the response carries the as_of stamp of
// that read. The isolation level is Read Committed (the platform's
// posture), so a concurrent commit can land between two sections; the
// stamp is what keeps that honest instead of hidden. No section opens a
// second transaction, which is why every module store this package calls
// exposes a transaction-taking variant of its read. The one exception is
// the custom-field catalog, which the contacts store resolves through the
// fieldcatalog seam on its own connection: it describes the workspace's
// column set, not the account's rows, so reading it a moment earlier
// changes no answer here.
//
// Authorization per section. Reading the company is mandatory.
// Everything else needs its own object grant, and a section the caller may
// not read is OMITTED and named in sections_omitted — never returned
// empty, because "you may not see this" and "there is none" are different
// answers and a UI that conflates them lies to the rep.
