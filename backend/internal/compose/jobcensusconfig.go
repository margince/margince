// Which job kinds a role wires is deployment-dependent — nine JobRunnerConfig
// conditions gate roughly fifteen kinds, and Embedder alone takes opposite
// postures on its two — so a census over a bare config would report a third of
// the contract as unwired and be right about none of it. This file supplies
// every one of those conditions, and refuses to let the census build when it
// has fallen behind a declaration that names a new one.
