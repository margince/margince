// listener gets, and what happens when an event lands on it.
//
// The consuming machinery is the product's own — a consumer group per listener,
// XREADGROUP, the reclaim pass, Dedupe around the handler — so nothing here
// re-implements delivery. What this file owns is the translation: an envelope
// becomes a published Delivery, and the context it runs on is bound to an
// invocation that has nobody behind it.
