// adapters behind Rows and Row. Split from extruntime.go, which owns the
// Runtime's lifetime and scope, when the Runtime grew the port — these are the

// ended answers pgx's own ErrTxClosed, which is already an honest refusal —
// and it is the accurate one, because the transaction can end while the
// Runtime is still perfectly live (the callback returned, the call did not).
