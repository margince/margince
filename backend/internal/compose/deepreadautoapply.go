// The deep read's auto-enrich lane (CAP-PARAM-7, ADR-0072/A118): a read the
// captured-organization sweep triggered applies its findings DIRECTLY instead
// of staging a confirm-first proposal — the system chose to enrich the company,
// so there is no human to confirm. The org fields + facts land through the same
// fill-empty + human-precedence machinery a human accept uses (so a human value
// is never overwritten and a re-run after a worker death is idempotent); site
// people still stage as leads (strangers stay staged, NEVER-8). The sweep cursor
// records the terminal outcome for observability, never gating the read.
