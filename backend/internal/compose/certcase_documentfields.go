// The certification case for document_extract/fields.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request comes from documentExtractRequest
// and the reply is read by readDocumentFields, the same builder and the same
// grounding the engine uses. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy,
// and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the VALUE each of the four fields should
// carry after the reading has grounded and coerced it — the string that would
// reach the deal, not the words the model chose around it. That is the level a
// document can be right or wrong at: an order form states one close date, and
// a reply that read it as a different one is wrong however well it wrote.
//
// A field the scenario does not name must come back OMITTED. That is what
// makes the empty expectation meaningful, and the empty expectation is the
// important one: plenty of real documents state none of the four, and a site
// that invents an amount for one of them writes a number onto a deal that
// nobody in the room ever agreed.
