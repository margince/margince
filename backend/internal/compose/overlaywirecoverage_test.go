// A binding that claims the mirror carries a field is a claim about what a
// CALLER RECEIVES, not about what the ingest layer stored. The two came apart
// once already — address and owner_id were mapped into the mirror and picked
// up by nothing — and the distance was invisible because every layer was
// correct on its own: the mapping landed the value, the mirror held it, and
// the wire assembly simply never named it. This gate closes that distance by
// asserting behaviour rather than declarations: a record the real mapping
// pipeline produced must yield a response body where every mapped slot
// carries what the mirror holds.
//
// The record is seeded THROUGH the pipeline (hubspot.Mapping → overlay.Apply)
// rather than hand-written in canonical shape, so the payload under test is
// the one production writes — a hand-built canonical fixture proves only that
// the wire reads the fixture's own author.
