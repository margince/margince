// The shared webhook chassis provider callbacks sit on: one route shape, one
// admission sequence — method guard,
// constant-time secret comparison, an optional second verifier, a bounded
// body read — and one response discipline. What differs between providers
// (secret granularity, payload durability, routing key) stays in each
// caller's WebhookSpec; the chassis enforces only the half that is
// genuinely shared, per the design's table of what cannot be.
//
// The response discipline is the reason Disposition exists: a malformed
// payload arrived and failed on our terms, so redelivering the same bytes
// forever would never help — that answers 2xx, same as success, so the
// provider stops retrying. A transient fault (a database blip, a queue
// momentarily down) is the opposite: redelivery is exactly the recovery
// mechanism, so that answers 500. A bare error cannot carry this
// difference, which is why Handle reports a Disposition alongside it.
