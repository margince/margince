// The REST door's half of the reopen rule.
//
// A passport is a REST Bearer credential, governed exactly like MCP (ADR-0055),
// so `POST /v1/deals/{id}/advance` reaches the SAME dynamic tier resolver the
// MCP tool does — through a different builder. When only the tool's builder
// learned to read the deal's current stage, this door went on judging a move by
// its destination alone, and an agent could still reopen a won deal here.
//
// That is review-loop rule 1 in one sentence: the invariant had two call sites
// and one was fixed.
