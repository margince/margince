// The whole adapter is the translations the tool surface cannot make for
// itself: which principal holds the key, and what a claim outcome means to a
// caller that speaks tool results rather than HTTP. The claim transaction, the
// 24h window, the digest comparison and the retention sweep are
// idempotency.go's, unchanged and shared — a second implementation would be a
// second answer to "is this the same call", and the two would drift the first
// time either window moved.
