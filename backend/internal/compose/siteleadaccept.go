// The site_lead ACCEPT executor (R5): a human approval of one staged
// published person captures them as a LEAD through the one capture Sink —
// never directly a person (ADR-0008: leads graduate; the Sink's own
// cross-source email dedupe stages the 🟡 merge when the person later
// emails in, and that staged merge is the promotion trigger, not this

// redemption is the exactly-once claim, and the Sink's natural key makes
// a re-read's re-accept land on the same lead row.
