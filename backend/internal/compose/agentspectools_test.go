// A catalog entry's allowlist is a list of NAMES, and a name is only as good as

// visible at the call site:
//
//   - a misspelt verb silently drops the one tool a goal depends on. The run
//     still starts, reads what it can, and reports a thin answer.
//   - an EMPTY set reads as "no narrowing" at the Job seam (see Job.Tools), so a
//     spec that loses its list quietly regains the whole catalog — the opposite
//     of what the entry is for.
//
// Derived from the live registry rather than from a list kept beside it, so a
// tool that is renamed or retired fails here instead of at 02:00 in a sweep.
