// Navigation is not evidence, and on a mega-menu site it is most of what the
// profile lane gets to read.
//
// Every page's excerpt is capped from its START (profileExcerptPages), and a
// large B2B site opens each page with the same header, mega-menu and language
// switcher. The budget is then spent before the page's own prose begins: on
// algolia.com the /about excerpt is still listing "Auto Parts, B2B Commerce,
// Ecommerce, Fashion, Grocery" at the cut, and the profile came back with two
// fields out of fifteen. Sites without that chrome — bestit.de, admetrics.io —
// return twelve to fifteen from the same budget.
//
// The fix needs no model call and no extra fetch, because the crawl already
// holds the whole corpus: text that appears near-verbatim at the head of most
// pages of one site is chrome BY DEFINITION, and can be measured. Nothing is
// inferred about what navigation looks like; the repetition is the evidence.
//
// Deliberately conservative. It only trims a COMMON PREFIX, only when several
// pages share it, and it always leaves the page's own text alone — a page that
// happens to be short, or a site with no shared header, passes through
// untouched. Over-trimming would destroy real evidence, and a missing fact is
// harder to notice than a noisy one.
