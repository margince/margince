// The certification case for rate_extract/fx.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from fxExtractRequest, the same builder the refresh calls, and the reply
// is judged by collect — the refresh's own method, its no-guess gate, its anchor
// and its rate arithmetic together. A case that rebuilt either would measure a
// copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the rates the refresh carries to its diff, one
// per foreign currency, each expressed as 1 unit of that currency in the
// workspace base. That map is the whole product of this site — what reaches an
// administrator's approval queue is a per-currency rate against the base — and it
// is where a misread costs the most: the prompt forbids the model any arithmetic
// and tells it to report the direction the page shows, so a page that states
// "1 USD = 0.92 EUR" is read correctly only if that direction survives intact to
// the anchor that inverts it.
//
// It is a subset claim, never an inventory: a rates page prices more currencies
// than a scenario cares to pin.
//
// Two things the expectation deliberately cannot name. A PASSAGE ID: the gate
// already requires that a pair cite one, and which passage grounds a rate is a
// fidelity question for the rubric — pinning an id would couple every scenario to
// the fixture's own line numbering, where one blank line renumbers everything
// after it. A DIRECTION: the page states one and the anchor removes it, so the
// corpus asserts the anchored rate the sheet stores and never the spelling the
// page happened to use.
