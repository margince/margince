// channel_provider is written, and the ONE place
// activities.SetChannelProviders and comms.SetChannelProviders are called — so
// the DB registry and both packages' in-memory snapshots cannot be set two
// different ways.
//
// It does NOT write activity_kind. A provider names a transport; an activity
// kind names what sort of interaction happened. Those are different axes, and
// the vocabulary of interaction kinds is fixed by the contract and seeded by
// the core migration, so boot has nothing to add to it.
//
// Driven by ReconcileChannelProviders, the boot step every process role runs.
// A role may run it more than once per process (a role-specific alternate
// wiring path, the worker's one-shot backfill helper), so every write here is
// an idempotent upsert, and every in-memory set is last-write-wins, never a
// once-only registration.
