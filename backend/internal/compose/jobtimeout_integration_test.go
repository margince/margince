// The declared timeout is what River actually applies. Proving this needed an
// injectable seam before jobs.Govern existed (PR #394's job-health test
// settled for asserting the constant and saying so in its own name); it now
// needs only the same wrapper production registers, over a fixture kind and a
// real River client.
//
// The fixture kind, timeout_probe, cannot live in api/jobs.yaml: adding it
// there (say, `timeout_probe: {go_type: TimeoutProbeArgs}`) would fail to
// COMPILE with `undefined: TimeoutProbeArgs` — declaredJobArgs
// (internal/compose/jobkinds_gen.go) is a closed union naming every
// declared kind's Go type by name, generated from the contract, and no
// production type answers for this fixture. It also cannot register
// through addDeclaredWorker (nothing outside the contract can reach that
// path). The escape hatch is the forbidigo exclusion for _test.go files:
// this registers directly through river.AddWorker + jobs.Govern with a
// hand-built Spec, which is legitimate because everything downstream of
// Govern — governedWorker, the Timeout() River calls, the Work() it wraps —
// is the exact path production's addDeclaredWorker also drives. Only the Spec
// is hand-built rather than read from the compiled table.

// deadlineReadMargin is the ONLY slack TestTheDeclaredTimeoutIsTheDeadlineRiverApplies
// grants, and it is absolute rather than a fraction of the declared value:
// a multiplicative window (e.g. declared/2..declared*10) pins the order of
// magnitude, not the value, and would admit a deadline that drifted from
// what was declared by a fixed offset or a small scaling error just as
// happily as it admits the right one.
//
// It covers the gap between River computing the deadline as Work is invoked
// and Work's first statement reading ctx.Deadline() -- a few goroutine
// scheduling slots, microseconds in practice. It deliberately does NOT cover
// pickup: the measurement starts INSIDE Work rather than at Enqueue, so
// LISTEN/NOTIFY dispatch, the insert round trip and a busy runner are outside
// the window entirely instead of being budgeted for.
//
// That distinction is why this constant is 25ms rather than the 200ms it
// replaces. Measuring from enqueue made the assertion "the declared timeout is
// right AND the runner picked the job up quickly", and the second half is a
// property of the machine, not of the code under test: a loaded runner put the
// total at 311ms, 329ms and 333ms against a 300ms ceiling on three separate
// occasions, reddening main once and two innocent pull requests. A wall-clock
// ceiling over pickup is a bet that CI never has a bad minute, and widening it
// only moves the bet.
