// The certification case for summarize/org_ask — the company view's prepared
// questions.
//
// It shares everything with summarize/org_brief except the request: the same
// account fixture, the same minted-id discipline, and the same production
// grounding filter deciding which sentences survive. What differs is the one
// thing this site adds — the answer must be grounded in the records the ASKED
// question is about, not merely in the account somewhere.
//
// That is why the scenario names both a question and the labelled records a
// correct answer cites. A `whats_open` answer that cites only last month's
// email is grounded and wrong, and a case that checked grounding alone would
// score it as correct.
