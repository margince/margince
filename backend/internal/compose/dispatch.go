//     landed, and a pass already RUNNING may have read the workspace before
//     they did. Deduplicating against it would drop exactly the data the
//     event fired about, and the caller would have no way to tell.

//     Handing telegram_poll a populated opts would drop its per-bot
//     uniqueness, and two in-flight polls for one bot steal each other's

//   - caller — callerOpts, which is the caller's to build precisely because
//     the same value serves a path that is NOT a fan-out: voiceBuildInsertOpts

//
// Every production caller is in this file. A FLEET PASS's child opts are built
