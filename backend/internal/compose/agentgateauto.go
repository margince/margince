// The 🟢 arm on the REST door: how a call the gate admitted at the auto-execute
// tier is dispatched, and what its write is conditioned on.
//
// Split from agentgate.go on the 500-line cap, along the boundary that file
// already draws for the other answer: agentgate.go decides whether a call is
// ADMITTED, agentgatestaging.go is what happens to a 🟡, and this is what
// happens to a 🟢. The two arms are deliberately readable side by side — both
// redeem a presented X-Approval-Token through the same consumePresentedToken,
// both charge their call ceiling once, and where they DIFFER (which version
// conditions the write, and at which moment the charge falls) each says why
// against the other.

// pinAutoExecutedWrite conditions an auto-executed agent write on the version
// its authority was taken at, by forwarding that version as the request's own
// If-Match. It reports whether the request may proceed; a refusal has already
// been written.
//
// The two calls this arm carries are pinned by DIFFERENT rules, because only one
// of them has something irreversible behind it.
//
// A REDEEMED call takes the server's version and takes it over anything the
// caller sent — the approval's own pin where it carried one, the version the
// tier gate read otherwise. That is redeemIfPresented's rule
// (agentgatestaging.go) on the other arm, adopted here for the reason that arm
// gives: this door hashes no If-Match into the identity a human's decision bound
// (canonicalHeaders, agentgatecanon.go), so a caller header is a version nothing
// proved while the server's pin names the state that was judged. Refusing the
// disagreement instead would be strictly worse and was, briefly, what this
// function did — consumePresentedToken has already SPENT the approval by the
// time this runs, so a refusal here destroys a human's one-shot yes on a call
// that never ran and can never be redeemed again. Forwarding is no weaker: the
// store re-checks the pin inside the transaction that mutates and refuses there
// unless the row is at the version the approval was granted against.
//
// An UNREDEEMED call is the ordinary 🟢 write, and there the CALLER's own
// If-Match is honoured — but only when it names the version this gate read, and
// that is CHECKED. The caller controls the header, so a version the gate never
// saw is a version nothing proved: a caller naming the version the racing close
// will PRODUCE walks straight through, because the store's compare then passes
// on precisely the record the tier decision does not describe. Preferring the
// caller unchecked would turn a coin-toss race into an armable one, and nothing
// has been consumed at that point, so refusing costs the caller only a retry.
//
// The precedence — caller, then released, then admitted — is agents.pinForWrite's
// (approvals.go), with ONE difference, named here because the two doors are
// meant to be comparable: pinForWrite silently prefers the released pin where it
// disagrees with the admitted one, and the branch below refuses instead. That
// branch is a defensive assertion rather than a case either door meets. Through
// the real stager a disagreement is unreachable — approvals pins server-side
// only for a concrete, version-checkable target, versions are monotonic, and the
// gate's read precedes the redemption's, so admitted ≤ current = released, and a
// row that really moved fails validateRedemptionTarget inside the redemption
// first. Whether refusing is even the right answer for a disagreement BOTH doors
// could only discover after the approval is consumed is
// margince/margince#1069; until that is settled, neither door's
// behaviour here is load-bearing.
// redeemed is passed rather than read back off the redemption, so this function
// and its caller cannot come to different answers about whether an approval was
// spent — the one fact both the charge above and the rule below turn on.
