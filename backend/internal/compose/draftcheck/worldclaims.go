// The claims no band makes true.
//
// Every other list in this package is gated on the conversation's state,
// because what it refuses is a claim about the recipient's MEMORY: "as
// discussed" is ordinary in a live exchange and false after eight months. These
// two are not gated, because what they refuse is a claim about the WORLD. A
// call either happened or it did not, and a sentence was either written or it
// was not — no amount of recent correspondence makes an invented one true.

// spokenExchange are the ways a draft asserts that a CONVERSATION happened —
// a call, a meeting, a chat — as opposed to the messages the record holds.
//
// Checked at every band, which is what separates this list from assumedMemory
// above. "As discussed" at band fresh is ordinary: an exchange is running and
// both sides are holding it. "It was a pleasure connecting earlier this week"
// is a different claim entirely — it says two people SPOKE, on a date, and
// nothing in any drafting input can support that. The 360 carries activities;
// a meeting the drafter can see is one on the calendar, and a calendar entry is
// not evidence that it took place or that anyone enjoyed it.
//
// The reported defect that produced this list: a company with a live support
// thread and no call whatsoever was drafted an opener reading "Marine, it was a
// pleasure connecting earlier this week." Every band's list was checked against
// that text and every one of them passed it.
// Every entry asserts a COMPLETED exchange on its own, which is the bar an
// entry has to clear. "Great to connect" does not: "it would be great to
// connect next week" is an ask, and the same words a sentence later are a
// memory. "We can cover that in our call tomorrow" is a plan. A list that
// refuses those refuses the drafts this product exists to write, so the past
// tense has to be IN the phrase rather than assumed around it.

// attributedClaim are the ways a draft puts words in the recipient's mouth.

// Also every band, and for the same reason. A drafting surface knows what its
// input said, never who said it: an activity reaches a person or an account
// through links that record what a message CONCERNS rather than who wrote it,
// and no 360 carries participants. The person and account prompts both state
// this ("say 'the question about X' and never 'you wrote'"), which is exactly
// why it needs a check — a rule the prompt states is a rule the model has
// already been observed breaking three times in this program.
//
// The stems rather than whole phrases. Enumerating completions is how the
// earlier lists lost: "introduction by" missed "introduction to", and a German
// list of wellbeing completions missed the one the model actually wrote.
