// Package draftcheck reads a finished draft and says what is wrong with it,
// deterministically.
//
// It exists because prompt rules keep losing to model reflexes. Three times in
// this program the same thing happened: a rule was written plainly in the
// system prompt, the model read it, and the model did the thing anyway —
// greeting the sender when only the sender was named, opening "I hope you are
// doing well" after eight months of silence, reaching for "circling back" when
// the band forbids it. Adding a fourth sentence to the prompt is the move that
// has already failed.
//
// So the phrases that must not appear are checked in Go, after generation, on
// the text the product is about to serve. A finding is not a refusal: the
// caller decides whether to regenerate, and the deterministic floor is always
// available underneath. What this package guarantees is that nobody has to
// notice the defect by reading the draft.
//
// It is deliberately a SMALL list of phrases with no judgement in it. "Does
// this draft assume shared memory?" is the judge's question and belongs in a
// rubric; "does this draft contain the words 'circling back'" is a fact, and a
// fact is what a gate can be built on.
