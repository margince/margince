// Retention for the transport-idempotency claim table.
//
// settleClaim records the VERBATIM 2xx response body of every replayable
// mutation, and for the replayable set that body is the whole record: a person
// with their names, e-mails, phones and custom fields; a deal with its amount;
// a DSR case with the data subject's identity. Nothing removed those rows. The
// 24h window in claimKey only makes a claim RE-CLAIMABLE in place by the exact
// same (workspace, principal, key, endpoint) tuple — a recurrence that in
// practice never happens — so the body sat in the table for the lifetime of the
// installation, under a role holding table-wide DML and inside every database
// backup, while the Art. 17 eraser and the Art. 15 export both had no idea the
// table existed.
//
// The answer is not to teach the eraser about a transport table (it belongs to
// this package; ADR-0054 keeps that boundary). It is for the snapshot not to
// outlive the retry it exists to make safe: past the replay window the row can
// never be replayed again, so keeping it stores subject data for no purpose at
// all — which is exactly what Art. 5(1)(e) storage limitation forbids. Inside
// the window, ensureReplayVisible is what keeps an erased record from being
// served (replayscope.go).
