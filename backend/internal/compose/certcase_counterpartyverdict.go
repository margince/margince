// The certification case for capture_counterparty_verdict/verdict.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from verdictRequest, the same builder the engine calls, and the reply is
// judged by validateVerdictPayload, the same validator the engine applies. A
// case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through
// the change that breaks the original.
//
// This site is where the injection corpus lives, so the distinction between a
// refused reply and a wrong one carries the whole meaning of a run: an escaped
// fence shows up as an answer about an address nobody asked about, which the
// validator refuses, while a fence that held shows up as an ordinary verdict
// that may simply disagree.
