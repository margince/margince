// A LinkedIn match a human has to judge is an APPROVAL, not a queue of its own
// (founder decision, 2026-08-02).
//
// The first build gave the suggest tier its own list, its own confirm and
// reject endpoints and its own card. That was a second inbox: the product
// already has one place where a proposal waits for a person, it already
// records who decided what and when, and a member who works through their
// morning approvals should not also have to remember a settings tab.
//
// So the tier stages here instead. The ghost row keeps only the OUTCOME
// (`unmatched` until decided, `confirmed` once the effect runs); the pending
// state lives in the approval, which ADR-0036 makes the authority object.
//
// Rejection is durable because the approval row persists. The matcher skips a
// ghost that already carries a decided proposal, so refusing "André is Andre"
// once means never being asked again — including after a re-import, which is
// the case that matters when somebody refreshes a five-thousand-row export.
