// The sweep that turns a staging's closed window into a decision.
//
// Expiry has always been a reading — effectiveStatus folds it in, so a stale
// item displays as expired and the row still says pending. That reading is
// enough to stop the item being decided and enough for nothing else: nobody is
// told, nothing is audited, and an automation parked behind it waits on a
// verdict that has already gone against it.
//
// This is the tick that writes it down. The decision itself belongs to the
// approvals module — status, the system-actor audit row, the event — and this
// file supplies only the clock, because a policy that fires on a schedule still
// needs something to be scheduled.
//
// It reaches no other module, which is worth saying because the obvious version
// does: see Work below for why the run transition travels on the event instead.
//
// One job, not a dispatcher and a child (ADR-0103 §1): the pass is one indexed
// scan over an installation-wide table, so there is nothing to fan out over.

// Work expires what is due. It ends no runs itself, and that is deliberate.

// The obvious shape is a second loop here calling automation's transition for
// every approval this tick expired. It would work most of the time and leave a
// window: a crash between the two would abandon a run behind an approval that
// is no longer pending, so the next tick — which scans for PENDING rows — would
// never come back to it. A comment explaining that gap is not a design.
//
// The gap does not need to exist. Each expiry emits approval.decided in the
// SAME transaction that writes it, through the outbox, and automation already
// consumes that event to end a parked run. So the transition is carried by a
// delivery guarantee this file does not have to reproduce: at-least-once,
// wrapped in the consumer's own dedupe, retried until it lands.
//
// Which leaves this worker with one job, and no cross-module edge at all.
