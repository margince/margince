// The MCP App views' lifecycle, owned by the api's composition.
//
// It lives here rather than in modules/agents/apps because it is a COMPOSITION
// question in three ways at once: which process role reads the documents, which
// deployment gate decides whether to read them at all, and how the run loop is
// cancelled on shutdown. The module owns the fetch policy, the admission check
// and the snapshot; none of those knows which binary it is inside.
//
// THE API ROLE ONLY. The worker composes no view provider: two processes
// refreshing one snapshot would be two answers to a question that has one, and
// the worker serves no /mcp at all.
