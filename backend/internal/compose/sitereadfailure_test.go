// What a failed site read RECORDS, and which failures are worth another try.
//
// Before this, every failure was stored as a bare status='failed' with no code,
// no sentence and no retry time: a real import produced 58 of them, all
// identical, and the companies behind them kept an empty record whose cause
// nobody could see. These cases pin each cause to the code an operator groups
// by and to the retry decision that follows from it.
