// The finance sweep's principal must pass the gates the sweep actually takes.
//
// This exists because it did not, and nothing caught it. PR #1936 changed the
// sweep's principal from PrincipalSystem to PrincipalConnector so the audit row
// would stamp actor_type=connector — correct on its own terms, and it silently
// cost the sweep auth.Require's unconditional pass for a system principal. The
// zero Permissions that came with it then denied the base-currency read, so
// every finance_sync pass WITH WORK TO DO was discarded after three attempts
// and no invoice was ever mirrored.
//
// The integration suite stayed green throughout, because its fixture stubs both
// halves of the failure: it injects a literal base currency instead of
// identity.BaseCurrencyOf, and it binds a principal carrying admin grants that
// production has never had. A test at that level cannot see this class of bug.
//
// So this test asserts the one thing those cannot: that the principal the
// WORKER builds satisfies the gate the REAL read takes.
