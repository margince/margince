// A tick that postpones itself, over a real migrated Postgres and a real River
// runner.
//
// EVERY CLAIM HERE IS ABOUT RIVER'S BEHAVIOUR, which is exactly why it is proved
// against River instead of reasoned about. The unit-level suites can show that
// the seam returns a *river.JobSnoozeError; only a real run can show that River
// then does what the design assumed — and the design rests on two assumptions a
// reader has no way to check from our source:
//
//   - a postponement is honoured on the LAST attempt, not discarded as exhausted.
//     If it were discarded, the change would work for a blip and fail for exactly
//     the long outage it was written for, which is the failure nobody would find
//     until an outage lasted longer than a poll's attempt cap.
//   - a postponed row occupies one of the states the fan-out's uniqueness window
//     covers, so the dispatcher's next insert for that workspace collapses into
//     it. If it did not, every postponement would add a row and an outage would
//     trade dead work for an unbounded queue.
