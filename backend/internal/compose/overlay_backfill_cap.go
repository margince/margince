// cappedIncumbent bounds an Incumbent's Backfill at limit records per
// object class — a dev/demo convenience (MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT)
// so connecting a real, large portal doesn't run an unbounded initial
// load on a laptop. It ends pagination early once limit records have been
// ingested for an object class, encoding the running count into the
// cursor it returns, so it is stateless and restart-safe: a resumed
// backfill reads the count back out of the cursor rather than needing any
// state of its own. Only Backfill is capped — Modified/Get/Associations/
// Owners/Name pass straight through, so continuous sync stays uncapped by
// design: a record edited AFTER the sweep's watermark still trickles in on a
// later tick even when the cap declined it here, and the ingest guards make
// the extras harmless.
//
// Capping Backfill alone bounds nothing the next sweep would not undo. It
// holds only because overlay.Reconcile floors the window of a class that has
// no watermark yet (its internal reconcileFloor, which documents why): read
// from the zero time and the Modified pass pulls down every record the cap
// just declined, so the laptop gets the whole portal one tick later. Capping
// Modified is NOT the alternative — truncating a watermark-ordered page
// stalls the watermark whenever more than limit records share a timestamp
// (a bulk import), and the sweep then re-reads that same page forever.
//
// Caveat (dev/demo only): the running count is carried in the persisted
// overlay_backfill_cursor as a "<count>|<inner>" prefix. If the cap is
// REMOVED (MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT unset) while a capped backfill
// is still mid-flight, the raw adapter is then handed that prefixed cursor
// and rejects it, so that object class's backfill fails every sweep
// (warn-logged) until its overlay_backfill_cursor row is reset. Changing
// the cap mid-backfill is therefore an operator action that also clears
// the cursor (or lets the class finish first). This is acceptable for a
// dev/demo knob; a production cap would carry the count out-of-band.
//
// The cap holding (rather than being undone one tick later, per the
// paragraph above) means a capped class's records below the cap are
// permanently declined — so it marks every page it cuts short as
// overlay.Page.Truncated, sticky into overlay_backfill_cursor.truncated
// (backfill.go/mirrorcheckpoints.go), which backfillCompleteFor
// (syncstatus.go) reads back so SyncStatus never reports a capped class
// complete. done still retires it (re-listing under the same cap would
// relearn nothing), but done and "genuinely complete" are no longer the
// same claim.
//
// Recovery is NOT automatic once a class converges truncated: unsetting
// MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT does not resume it — done=true still
// short-circuits Backfill (backfill.go) before the raw adapter is ever
// reached again, so truncated never clears on its own. The operator action
// is the same one the mid-flight caveat above names: reset that object
// class's overlay_backfill_cursor row (or reconnect, which purges it) so
// the next sweep backfills it for real, this time uncapped.
