// unitRefusal maps the four published refusal classes onto the product's own
// wire vocabulary, and leaves everything else exactly as it found it.
//
// It is portRefusal's MIRROR, and the direction is why it is a second function
// rather than an inverse table. Inbound, a core error is stripped to its class
// because a unit is other people's code. Outbound, the unit is answering its
// OWN caller about its OWN contract, so the sentence travels: a member told
// "connecting needs the personal access token from your Dispact profile" can
// act on it.
//
// Without this every one of the four reaches httperr unclassified, because
// they are the extension surface's sentinels and httperr's table is the core's
// fixed §0 registry — which no extension may extend. A caller who mistyped a
// base URL was answered `500 internal`, sending them to look for an outage
// instead of at their own input, and the operator's log grew an "unhandled
// error" line for a request nothing was wrong with.
//
// The mapped classes are the core's own codes rather than extension-specific
// ones, which is the same rule the route states about shape: a unit's refusal
// reads on the wire exactly like the refusal of the core route beside it.
