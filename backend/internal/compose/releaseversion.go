// The guard that keeps a torn release set from running.
//
// WHY THERE IS ANYTHING TO GUARD. A customer pulls each role image by tag, and
// the tag resolver answers each pull separately. Two pulls are two requests, so
// a publish landing between them hands back a set whose roles come from
// different releases — the classic case being `latest` moving mid-install. The
// OCI distribution protocol has no way to express "these three manifests, or
// none", so the registry cannot refuse it at the pull. The refusal has to happen
// where the set first exists as a whole, which is at run time.
//
// THE API IS THE AUTHORITY, and it is the authority because it already is one:
// the api image ships cmd/migrate and its entrypoint applies the schema before it
// serves, so the schema the installation runs on is the schema THIS role's release
// brought. (cmd/migrate is its own process role and the only caller of the
// migrator; what makes the api the authority is that the two ship and run
// together, not that this binary migrates.) Recording its own release as the
// installation's is therefore a statement of fact, not an election. Every other
// role compares itself against that record and refuses to start when it
// disagrees.
//
// THAT ASYMMETRY IS WHAT MAKES AN UPGRADE POSSIBLE. A symmetric rule — every
// role refuses while any peer disagrees — deadlocks the moment two roles restart
// independently, because each sees the other's old version and neither can be
// the first to move. Here the api moves first by definition: it records the new
// release, and the roles that follow match it. A rollback works for the same
// reason, which is why this compares for EQUALITY and never for order: the api
// simply states the release, so going back to an older one is an ordinary move
// rather than a special case somebody has to remember to allow.
//
// A TORN SET STOPS, AND STAYS STOPPED. If the api is release B and the worker is
// release A, the worker exits on every start and the orchestrator keeps
// restarting it. That is the intended outcome: a crash-looping role with the two
// versions in its log is visible, where a worker quietly running the wrong
// release is not. It does not resolve itself, because nothing about a torn pull
// resolves itself — an operator has to deploy the set again, at one release.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES ARE BOUNDED RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE, and a reader has to know which:
//
//   - The check happens AT BOOT, once. A worker already running when the api
//     records a new release is not re-checked, so an api-only restart leaves the
//     old worker serving until something else restarts it.
//   - The record is LAST WRITER WINS. During a rollout that has api replicas from
//     two releases alive at once, either may be the last to record, so the release
//     the installation reports can move backwards on its own.
//
// What holds regardless is the invariant this exists for: whichever release wins
// the record, the roles that disagree with it refuse, so no mixed set serves.
// Closing either bound is a design change rather than a fix — a monotonic record
// would cost rollback — so both are tracked rather than worked around here.

// It carries no scope, because ADR-0091 §8 phase D took the tenant column off

//
// The residue this DOES admit, named because it is not hypothetical: an
// installation that merged an ARCHIVED predecessor still holds that
// predecessor's release rows — 0272 exempts the ledgers from the residue gate
// by name, precisely because their immutability trigger makes clearing them
// impossible — and this read can no longer tell them from its own. What keeps
// the guard honest is that RecordInstallationRelease writes the same unscoped
// ledger, so the api's own row is the newest as soon as it boots. The window is
// a worker booting against residue before that api boot, which is #2196.
//
// occurred_at leads the ordering, with id as the deterministic tiebreak, for the
// reason extensioninventory spells out: uuidv7 ids are monotonic only within one
