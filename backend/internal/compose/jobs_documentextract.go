// uniqueness window INCLUDES completed, so a re-enqueue of a reading whose
// earlier job has finished is silently skipped — and EnqueueTx cannot see the
// skip. That is exactly the path the abandoned-reading recovery takes: a job
// that completed while leaving its row `running` (a retry inside the lease
// declines the claim and returns), the lease expires, a rep presses the button
// again, and the re-armed row is queued with no job behind it. Every later
// press then joins that row, and the in-flight index blocks any fresh reading —
// the document is unreadable until somebody deletes the row by hand.

// a reading in flight still dedupes, a finished one no longer blocks its own
