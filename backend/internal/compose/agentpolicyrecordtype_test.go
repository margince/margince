// A contract mapping names a record_type the tool it names can actually serve.

// TestEveryDeclaredToolVerbIsRegistered checks only that the VERB exists, so
// two mappings sat broken in plain sight: GET /v1/users declared
// search_records/app_user and GET /v1/teams declared search_records/team, and
// search_records serves neither — its enum is person/company/deal/lead/
// project and app_user is not even a datasource entity. The declaration read
// as a working route to anyone auditing the contract, and answered nothing.
//
// This holds the record_type against the tool's own published schema, which is
// the same string a caller would send. A tool that takes no record_type at all
// (list_colleagues answers seats, not records) declares one only as a label
// for the policy table, so it is exempt by having no such property.
