// expensive way and both derived from the surface rather than maintained as a
// list.
//
// A tool that names a document has made a promise on the server's behalf: that
// the document exists, and that reading it is worth a caller's round trip. The
// gates below hold each half. Neither is a style rule — the first closes a dead
// end a caller cannot get out of, and the second was measured on the
// certification band before it was written down.
