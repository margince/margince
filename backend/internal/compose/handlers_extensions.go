package compose

// The composed-extension inventory (GET /v1/extensions): what this binary
// actually composed, per unit.
//
// It exists for the role editor. An extension's objects reach a role document as
// `ext_<unit>_<object>` and nothing else in the grant map says which product
// surface a name belongs to — an operator reading a flat list of thirty core
// objects and two ext_ ones has no way to know that granting one of them is what
// turns on the notes screen. This answers that grouping question, and answers it
// from the same values the boot reconciliation validated.
//
// It lives in compose rather than in a module because the composed set is not a
// module's fact: it is the composition root's, held in this package's own
// accessors (ComposedExtensions, ComposedVerbs, servedExtensionJobs). A module
// asked to serve this would need those handed to it, which is a dependency in
// the wrong direction for a value that is fixed at build time.
