// The outbound-send composition. Two transports enter the send path — the
// HTTP handler and the MCP send_email tool — and both call
// activities.Store.SendEmail, so everything that governs a send hangs off the
// STORE. (A deterministic automation cannot send: its send_email action stages
// an approval, and the automation module's own Comms seam declares DraftEmail
// alone — automation/seams.go.)
//
// There are TWO stores, not one, and no single constructor can build both: the
// HTTP handlers carry their own (server.go's activities.NewHandlers, which
// also wires the public-booking seams no tool surface has), while sendStore
// below builds the one the tool surface sends through.
//
// SendPath is what keeps them from forking. It is the ONE record of how this
// role sends: every option writes only to it, sendStore reads only from it,
// and applySendPath projects it onto the HTTP handlers once the options have
// finished. A send value configured anywhere else — set directly on one
// store — reaches one transport and not the others, which is exactly the
// drift this shape exists to make impossible.
