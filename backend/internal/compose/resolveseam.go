// The cross-module edge behind resolve_entities: the people module owns the
// match ladder, the agents module owns the tool. Neither imports the other
// (ADR-0054 §3), so the edge is composed here.
//
// This file carries the two seam types across and NOTHING else. In particular it
// makes no decision about a match: what crosses is the RECORDS the ladder named,
// each carrying whether a key or a similarity named it, and the tool derives the
// caller-visible decision from the ones that survive their row scope. No verdict
// word crosses here, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy — a word computed
// over the whole workspace is a word a record the caller cannot read helped
// choose, which is the visibility oracle agents.decisionFor exists to close.
