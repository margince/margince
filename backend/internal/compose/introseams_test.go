// The bound is reported to a model as a warning — "a warmer route may exist
// outside this list" — so the boundary case is not a detail. An account holding
// exactly the fetch bound had nothing dropped, and telling a rep that someone
// warmer exists when the list is complete is the same false claim as hiding a
// cap, pointed the other way.
