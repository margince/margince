// Every job worker that reaches a store must bind an ACTOR, not just a
// workspace.
//
// A queue is not a request: it inherits no principal, so a worker that binds
// only its tenant reaches the first RBAC gate with nothing to check and the
// write is refused. The provider-run workers shipped that way — the poll job
// failed with "no actor bound to context" on every pass, so a paid enrichment
// run sat in_progress forever and the values it bought reached nobody. The
// money was spent and there was nothing to show for it.
//
// Nothing could have caught that but this shape of test. The failure is in the
// wiring rather than in any store, it needs a real queue to reproduce, and it
// looks exactly like a slow provider from the outside.
//
// So this reads the wiring itself: every Work method that builds a store must
// also bind an actor. Derived from the tree rather than a hand-kept list,
// because the next job added is the one nobody remembers to check.
//
// Three older workers are waived below rather than fixed. They have the same
// shape, but whether each one actually reaches a gated write is a question
// about three other subsystems, and answering it wrongly would either break
// working jobs or paper over a live defect. Issue #1127 tracks that audit; the
// waiver is a ratchet — a waived worker that starts binding an actor fails
// this test until its entry is removed.
