// overlayread.go when that file reached the size ceiling.
//
// Search is its own concept rather than a sixth read: the get/list handlers each
// serve one entity type through one provider call, while this one walks every
// mirrored type, holds its own limit policy, and folds heterogeneous hits into a
// single ranked answer. It is the only read here that has to decide what a
// result MEANS across types, which is why the vocabulary and the clamp live with
// it rather than beside handlers that never consult them.
