// What each stage says about one message.
//
// Every branch here answers the same question — what can this rung HONESTLY
// claim — and the recurring wrong answer is silence. A stage with no row is not
// a stage that did not run.
//
// Three answers, and the boundaries between them are the whole file:
//
//   - it did not apply, which the rows present must support;
//   - it ran, with what it concluded;
//   - we cannot tell, which covers BOTH a swept window and rows that are not
//     the reader's. Those two are deliberately one sentence: distinguishing
//     them would tell a non-owner whether a row exists.
