// Package pipelinetrace assembles one message's journey through the ingress
// pipeline into something a member can read.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN COMPOSE. The ladder crosses modules: capture owns the stored
// rungs, activities owns the label and the person link, and neither may import
// the other. A module never imports a sibling, so the assembly is a compose
// orchestration that owns no entity of its own — the same shape compose/briefs
// takes.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It does not re-derive any module's rule. Whether the
// attention classifier would read a message is a predicate activities owns, and
// this package asks rather than re-implements: a second copy is correct until
// the first one moves, and a trace that explains a rule wrongly is worse than
// one that says nothing.
