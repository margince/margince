// What each rung is allowed to CLAIM.
//
// Every judgement this feature is about lives in rungs.go, and every one of them
// is a sentence shown to a member. The failures worth catching are not crashes:
// they are a rung that says the stage did not apply when the record was merely
// swept, or that a colleague's message was never captured when the truth is that
// the reader may not be told.
//
// No database: rung() is a pure function of a stored ladder, the derived facts
// and the caller's standing. That is why it can be exhaustive here.
