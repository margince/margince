// The jobs gate family, asked about an extension kind.
//
// Every gate in this package was written when "declared" meant "named in
// api/jobs.yaml", and each has an arm that reports a kind it does not recognise:
// the census's totality check, the registry's args-type pairing, and the
// wiring's derived-timeout join. A composed kind reaches all three — it is
// registered into the same jobRegistry and answered by the same jobs.SpecFor —
// so if any of them still reads the core table alone, an installation with a
// unit enabled fails its own build gate for having composed exactly what it was
// asked to compose. That is the failure this file exists to prevent, and it can
// only be seen with a composed set actually registered, which no other test in
// this package does.
//
// It is one file rather than an arm added to each gate's own tests because the
// claim is about the FAMILY: what must hold is that every gate agrees, and
// splitting it up would let a new gate join the family with nobody noticing it
// was never asked this question.
