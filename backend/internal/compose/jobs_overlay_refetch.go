// OverlayRefetchArgs is a targeted single-record re-fetch, enqueued by two
// producers: a validly-signed, portal-bound webhook (webhook-as-signal,
// OVA-WIRE-10) and the sweep's re-projection phase (jobs_overlay_sweep.go),
// which names the rows an older mapping declaration projected. Both refresh
// the named record through the same idempotent ingest the poller uses. The args
// ARE the coalescing key — River's unique-by-args (OVA-PARAM-10, scheduled a
// short window ahead) collapses a record edited rapidly in the incumbent to
// ONE re-fetch rather than N. IncumbentClass is the HubSpot object class the
// record is read back under — any of the four record classes
// (contacts/companies/deals/leads) or the five engagement classes
// (calls/meetings/emails/notes/tasks); ExternalID is the mirror external id,
// which for an engagement carries its own class namespace ("calls:123",
// OVA-MAP-7) and is bare otherwise.
