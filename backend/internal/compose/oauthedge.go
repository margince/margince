// The A2 authorization server's edge on the api origin: the ceilings on every
// unauthenticated endpoint of the handshake — the passport mint, dynamic client
// registration, the human consent flow, and RFC 7009 revocation — plus the
// body-handling two of those keys depend on. The /mcp transport's own edge is
// mcpedge.go, and both draw from the ONE mcpLimiters set built there.
//
// Every arm below obeys the shape mcpLimiters describes, and it is a shape
// rather than a number because of what clientIP can be: behind the
// TLS-terminating front end this deployment documents, the peer address is one
// constant for every caller on earth, so a tight ceiling keyed on it is an
// outage a cheap flood buys. Each arm therefore meters a key the caller
// PRESENTS, paired with a high per-peer ceiling that a varying presented key
// cannot escape. Where an endpoint has no presented key at all (registration),
// that is said outright rather than papered over.
