// The transport directory (GET /v1/channel-providers): which messaging
// transports this installation registered, and what to call them.
//
// It is the resolver for `ProviderRef` (ADR-0107/A158). A provider vocabulary is
// a DEPLOYMENT fact — what this binary composed, including any unit present
// under extensions/ — so the contract cannot enumerate it without asserting that
// the legal set is identical everywhere, which is false. The contract states the
// invariant and this operation resolves it, moving the typing from build time to
// a runtime capability document.
//
// It lives in compose for the same reason the extension inventory does, and one
// more besides: the composed set is the composition root's fact, and
// `channel_provider` carries no workspace_id, so a module could not read it
// without an unscoped pool it is not allowed to open.

// ListChannelProviders (GET /v1/channel-providers). Any authenticated seat.
//
// Deliberately NOT admin-only, which is where it parts company with its closest
// precedent (GET /v1/extensions). That one enumerates the installation's
// internal surface — routes, jobs, unit versions — which is operator
// information. This one answers "what do I call the transport this message
// arrived on", and EVERY member's timeline needs it: gating it on admin would
// leave every other seat rendering raw provider ids.
//
// The authorization argument has two halves, and both have to hold.
//
// The first is label PROVENANCE: every `label` here, on both arrays, is derived
// or compiled in and never operator-configured (see channelproviderfacts.go). An
// administrator-typed name would make this a disclosure decision instead of a
// display one.
//
// The second is the SET. `capture_sources` publishes which units this binary
// composed and which external system each one captures from, to every seat and
// to any read-scope passport. That is deliberately unprivileged, on the same
// ground LoadChannelProviderDirectory already records for a unit's provider id: a
// member whose row arrived through a unit needs to know what to call it, and what
// is gated is the ACT rather than the NAME. The one thing it widens is that a
// CAPTURE-ONLY unit — no channel, possibly nothing the caller may read — becomes
// visible; that is fingerprinting, not access, and the alternative is the raw
// `ext:` form on a member's own capture-activity window, which they can already
// reach without a grant. Anything privileged about a unit (its version, routes,
// jobs, RBAC objects) stays on the admin-only /v1/extensions.
//
// Authentication itself is the chassis's, applied to every /v1 route before a
// handler runs — hence no gate call in the body, unlike ListExtensions.

// channelProviderDirectory adapts the boot snapshot to the agent surface's
// seam. It reports the same entries the HTTP directory serves, by calling the
// same shaping function — two surfaces answering one question two ways is
// exactly the drift this arc has spent its budget removing.
//
// THE ONE FIELD IT DELIBERATELY DROPS is `attachments`, and the reason WAS a
// budget: the core listing rode in every Surface-B prompt and sat a few hundred
// tokens under a ceiling measured across the whole catalog, so the carriage
// object plus the copy explaining it would have pushed the listing past it.
//
// THAT GROUND IS GONE (#2355). The listing is now bounded per declared agent,
// and neither shipped agent attaches a channel tool at all — the field costs
// them nothing, and the whole-catalog measurement has thousands of tokens of
// room besides.
//
// The field stays dropped anyway, and the honest reason is smaller than the
// budget was: NO SCHEDULED AGENT ATTACHES A CHANNEL TOOL, so today nothing on
// this surface would read the field. The parked-delivery path that teaches an
// agent the bounds is the REST and human send path, not one either shipped
// agent can reach.
//
// So this is currently a question about a capability nobody exercises. Adding
// the field back is answerable on its own merits the moment an agent attaches a
// channel tool — see #1985, whose budget premise this supersedes.
//
// IT ALSO DROPS `capture_sources`, for the same reason and with the same shape
// of consequence: a passport reading REST resolves a unit's `ext:` provenance and
// the same passport's tool listing does not. Nothing is governed differently by
// it — both surfaces are the one read-scope operation, and an id nothing resolves
// falls back to itself — so what an agent loses is a display string, not an
// answer. It is named here rather than left implicit because an unnamed
// divergence is how the two surfaces come to disagree about something that
// matters.
