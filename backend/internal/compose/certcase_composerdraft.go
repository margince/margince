// The two composer drafting sites: the person page's "Write email" and the
// company page's first-touch outbound.
//
// Both existed and neither was certified. ADR-0074 requires every shipped site
// to be declared, registered and certified through its PRODUCTION path, and the
// change that gave all three drafting surfaces one shared rules block changed
// both of these prompts — so leaving them undeclared would mean two prompts
// changed inside an uncertified blind interval.
//
// They are one file because they are the same site twice: same fixture shape,
// same evaluation, differing only in which package's Write drives them and what
// a fixture is a projection OF. What they do not share with the reply site is
// the register question — neither composer has a voice variant yet, so there is
// one system prompt per site and nothing to disagree about. When Voice DNA
// reaches them, they gain the variant the way the reply site has it.
