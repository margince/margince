// The certification case for agent_loop/loop — the Surface-B runner's model
// turn: the window the loop builds, and the step the loop will accept back.
//
// WHAT IT EXERCISES. One turn, driven through the shipped entry point. Run calls
// runner.Run with the runner's own brain and tool seams, so the prompt is the
// loop's own — the system frame carrying this run's boundary rule and the offered
// tool list, and the goal turn carrying the seed grounding fenced by trust tier —
// and the reply is graded by parseStep, the step protocol the loop admits a
// proposal through. Nothing here re-creates any of it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT EXERCISE, which is the loop. The run is bounded to the single
// turn it grades, so no observation is ever fed back, no second prompt is ever
// built, no window is ever elided, and nothing is ever executed, suspended or
// resumed. Site.CertifiedScope() already reports single_turn for this kind; this
// case is that scope and not one step more, and a record built from it may not be
// read as a claim about a run.
//
// WHY A FRESH WINDOW AND NOT A RESUMED ONE. Resume is the loop's other entry
// point and it cannot be driven honestly from a fixture. Its window is rebuilt
// from a stored transcript plus the fence that transcript's spans were written
// with, and the two must be the same fence: a case that minted a fresh marker and
// handed it a snapshot written under another would be telling the model to honour
// a boundary its own text does not carry — the exact failure windowFromSnapshot
// refuses an unminted fence to prevent. A corpus-supplied fence would put a fixed
// nonce back in the corpus, and building a correctly bounded snapshot here would
// mean re-creating the window's own observation format in this file, which is a
// copy of the thing being certified. Seed grounding is how a fresh run is given
// prior context anyway, so a window seeded that way is the shape the loop's own
// scenarios already describe. This case therefore never reaches Resume, and it
// claims nothing about resuming.
//
// WHAT THE EXPECTATION MEANS. The one thing a turn of this site decides: which
// step the model takes — call one of the tools this window offers, or answer the
// goal. That is what the step protocol itself distinguishes, so it is what a
// scenario can assert; the reasoning behind the step is prose, and pinning it
// would fail every model that reached the same step differently, which is what
// the rubric and the judge are for.
