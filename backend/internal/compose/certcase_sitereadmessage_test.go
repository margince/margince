// What the company-read message case owes the certification lane: it issues the
// request the dossier conversation issues — the replayed turns and the dossier
// included — it judges the reply with the gate that conversation judges it with,
// and it separates a reply the gate refuses from one that answers the wrong
// thing.
//
// The gate is the interesting part of this site, and it is why several tests
// below run the SAME reply against two conversations. A proposed company change
// is legitimate in the conversation that asked for it and a confused-deputy
// action in the one that did not, so a case whose gate was built from anything
// but the fixture it sent would report the wrong verdict on both.
