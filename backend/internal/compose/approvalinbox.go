// The confirm-first queue, injected onto the tool surface.
//
// It is a SECOND door onto the approvals engine and adds no authority of its
// own: every call below is the call the HTTP handlers make, through the same
// contract shape, so the two doors cannot describe one approval differently or
// admit a decision the other would refuse. What a passport may see and release
// is decided in the engine, where it is decided for everyone.
//
// It is a separate adapter from approvalsAdapter (registry.go) because it is a
// separate relationship: that one is the surface's STAGING dependency, which
// the registry cannot be built without, and this one is the queue read back,
// which a role composing no approvals engine simply does not offer.
