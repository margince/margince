// The finance mirror's River wiring (ADR-0083/A128): a sweep every six hours
// that fans out one pass per workspace, and the pass itself.
//
// The provider is chosen HERE rather than inside the module, which is the
// point of the seam: the store knows how to mirror a ledger and nothing about
// where one comes from. Today the only provider is the offline generator, so
// an installation that connects "offline_demo" gets a plausible ledger and one
// that connects anything else gets an honest refusal rather than a silent
// no-op.
//
// Job args and worker adapters only — the mirror stays River-agnostic.

// The connector is the acting principal: every mirrored row carries

// anything a person typed.
//
// PrincipalConnector and not PrincipalSystem, and the two have to agree: the
// audit row stamps actor_type from the TYPE and actor_id from the ID, so a
// system type beside a `connector:` id writes a row that contradicts itself,
// and audit_log is append-only — the contradiction cannot be corrected
// afterwards. No OnBehalfOf: finance has no connect flow and so no granting
// human, and storekit.OwnerOrActor already reads a bare connector as the row
// nobody owns.
//
// It carries PERMISSIONS because that Type costs it the system exemption.
// auth.Require passes a PrincipalSystem unconditionally; everything else falls
// through to Permissions.Allows, which a zero Permissions denies. Without a
// grant the sweep read its way into "this job's principal is not permitted the
// action it attempted", and every pass WITH WORK TO DO was discarded after
// three attempts — an installation whose invoices simply never arrived, with
// nothing on any screen to say why.
//
// The grant is the fixed minimum this worker exercises, the way
// telegramChannelPrincipal states its own: the mirror converts the source
// ledger into the installation's base currency as it writes, and reads that one
// setting through identity.BaseCurrencyOf. Nothing else on the sweep's path
// takes a gate. RowScopeAll because a mirrored ledger belongs to the workspace
// rather than to any seat.

// carrying admin grants, and so cannot see this class of failure at all.
