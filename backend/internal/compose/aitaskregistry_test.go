// The sites whose case deliberately measures less than the production path, and

// kind — the case drives the whole path, retries and fallbacks included.
//
// The list is written out rather than derived for the same reason NewTaskCensus
// itself is: a list derived from the cases would compare the census to itself
// and agree with whatever this build declares, including a narrowing added to
// hide a case that quietly stopped driving its path, and including one dropped
// from a case that still needs it.
// gatekit:fixture the scope each narrowed site's reading is compared against —
// expected data, not an exception granted to the site.
