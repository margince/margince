// The `unsure` disposition's review queue (ADR-0072/A118 §4): when the verdict
// engine cannot answer above the confidence floor, it asks a human instead of
// guessing — and the offer it stages is deliberately lopsided.
//
// ACCEPT creates the records capture withheld. REJECT does nothing at all: no
// records, no hiding, no redaction — the mail stays exactly where it is and the
// disposition simply records that a human declined to make it a counterparty.
// That asymmetry is what keeps the approvals engine approve-only-effects: a
// proposal may only ever ADD, so a stale or mistakenly-rejected offer can never
// destroy anything.
