// What the refusing incumbent's error MEANS to the code that reads it, which is
// a separate question from whether it refuses.
//
// jobs_overlay.go's isConnectionLevelIncumbentError decides whether a reconcile
// sweep aborts and backs the connection off, or logs one object class and
// carries on. An error it does not recognise takes the second branch — so a
// refusal it cannot classify would let the fleet worker sweep a connection where
// EVERY call refused, treat each refusal as that class's own data defect, and
// finish by recording the sweep a success. A green sweep that did nothing is the
// precise false green this build exists to remove, so the classification is
// pinned here rather than left to the wrapping to imply.
//
// Needs no database despite the tag: the behaviour under test exists only in
// this build.

// refusals is every way the connect and reconcile paths can reach this
// incumbent. Enumerated rather than asserted through errNoLiveIncumbent
// directly, because the claim is about the METHODS: a later one that forgets to
// refuse, or refuses with a bare error of its own, is the regression, and
// comparing the sentinel to itself could never see it.
//
// A hand-written list is a census, and a census goes stale in silence — adding a
// method to overlay.Incumbent forces refusingIncumbent to implement it, but
// nothing would force it in here, so the new method would ship with this test
// green. TestTheRefusalCensusCoversEveryMethod holds the list to the interface.
