// Automatic enrichment on create (PI-EVT-1): a person who arrives gets their
// data bought from the connected provider, if the customer switched that on.
//
// THE TRIGGER IS THE EVENT, NOT THE WRITER — the same shape personautoenrich
// uses, and for the same reason. person.created reaches the outbox because the
// write shape puts it there, so manual entry, capture, import and the site
// read all land here without any of them knowing this consumer exists.
//
// It only QUEUES. The run is admitted, fenced, frozen and reserved inside
// QueueRun's transaction, and the provider is called later by the worker, so
// a slow vendor can never hold up the event lane and a refusal costs nothing.

//   - A HUMAN typing a contact is the individual create the
//     automatic_individual_create toggle is about.
//   - A CONNECTOR is capture: a mailbox sync creates a person per external
//     counterparty, and connecting a mailbox with a year of history would
//     otherwise buy thousands of records under a toggle that says
//     "individual". That is what automatic_import governs, and it defaults
//     OFF with a preview and an estimate behind it (PI-PARAM-2).
//   - An AGENT gets nothing. Buying provider data is human-only on the REST
//     surface (x-agent-access: human-only, ADR-0055), and an agent that can
//     create a person must not reach through this event what the policy
//     denies it at the door — the seat cap is what the agent's human could do
//     through the same gate, and there is no gate here.

//     backfills). It has no human intent behind it, so it buys nothing.
