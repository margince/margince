// The extension tier's job SEAM: how a unit's scheduled pass becomes two live
// River kinds without api/jobs.yaml ever naming it.
//
// It cannot go through declaredJobArgs. That union's members are bare
// identifiers in package compose, compiled from the base contract — an
// extension module cannot be named there, and the generated file is committed
// and drift-gated, so a composed installation could not regenerate it without
// failing the gate on every build that enabled a unit. What CAN be composed is
// data: the unit's fragment declares the two kinds, gen-composition reads them
// out of the merged contract and re-emits them as extension.JobDeclaration
// literals, and this file turns each one into a registered dispatcher and a
// registered workspace child over ONE pair of args types.
//
// One pair, many kinds, because River resolves a kind from the args VALUE on
// insert (args.Kind()) and from the registered args value on registration
// (river.AddWorkerArgs). So `Kind()` reading a field is not a trick — it is the
// only shape that lets a composed set of unknown size reach River at all —
// and every other governed property still comes from the declaration, which is
// what jobs.RegisterComposed puts where SpecFor can answer for it.
//
// extjobsrun.go is the other half: the args types, the two workers, and the
// authority the child re-derives before it runs anything.
