// The queue half of the census: api/jobs.yaml's queues: block held to the pool
// set the runner actually hands River.
//
// Generation checks that every kind's queue: names a declared entry, so the
// references are sound — but the entries themselves described a pool nothing
// compared them to. Two silent failures live in that gap. A bound changed in
// jobQueues() and not in the file leaves operators reading a number no client
// runs at. A queue declared in the file and never built is worse: the fan-out
// helper reads the DECLARED queue when it inserts a child, so the rows land on
// a queue no client works, and they sit runnable forever while the dispatcher
// that made them keeps reporting a clean pass.
