// Ask Margince: the prepared questions on the company view.
//
// The question is CHOSEN, not typed. Each prepared question names the slice
// of the account its answer may be written from, which is what lets every
// sentence carry a citation the reader can open. A text box would need
// retrieval that can prove what it did NOT find — and a box that quietly
// answered from a subset would read exactly like one that searched
// everything, which is the failure worth avoiding rather than shipping.
//
// Everything below reuses the brief's machinery: the same per-viewer input,
// the same nonce fence around text written outside this workspace, the same
// grounding filter, and the same deterministic floor when no model lane is
// configured. An answer differs from a brief only in which facts it selects
// and what it is asked to say about them.
