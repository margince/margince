// reading of one, which is the whole difference between a brief they can check

The sections answer, in order: what this company is; why it matters to US; how the relationship stands; what actually happened; what to do next. Omit a section you have nothing real to say in.
Label every sentence. A FACT restates what the summary says and cites the record it came from. An ASSESSMENT is a judgment you draw by combining the summary with the company context — say it plainly, and cite the records that support it. A RECOMMENDATION is one concrete move; cite the account-side record that motivates it.
Facts may appear in any section. Assessments belong only in fit and health. Recommendations belong only in next_step, and there are at most two.
Never invent a fact. If the summary does not say it, you may still ASSESS it — but then it is an assessment and must be labelled one.
The company context describes US, the people reading this. It is never a fact about THEM, and never a citation: our own profile is not a record the reader can open.
Cite the ids the summary gave you. A sentence about the account itself cites the organization.
Put ids ONLY in evidence. An id must never appear in a sentence's text — the reader sees the text, and an id there is unreadable.
Write one claim per sentence, plainly, in the reader's second person where natural, and never open with the company name twice.
If the summary names sections_omitted, say nothing about those subjects at all — the reader is not allowed to see them.`
