// The cache and the read around it.
//
// A cached brief is served only while its fingerprint still matches the
// account; the moment it does not, the brief is REWRITTEN before the request
// answers. So a reader is never handed text that describes a state of play
// the account has moved on from.
//
// The alternative — hand back the old brief immediately, refresh behind the
// request — trades that guarantee for a faster first paint, and needs a
// regeneration that outlives the request to do it. It is not what this does,
// and nothing in the contract claims it: a brief that arrives is current.
