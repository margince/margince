// stops an undeclared kind compiling; MustBeTotal refuses a boot that got one
// in anyway; Govern makes the declared timeout the one River applies. None of
// them can see the other direction — a kind declared and never wired, a
// {derived: …} timeout whose Go constant moved out from under it, an args
// field somebody added without declaring what it carries. Those are the drifts
// a declaration nobody checks accumulates, and this is where both halves are
// laid beside each other.

// It builds a REAL runner assembly to do it, minus the River client, because
// which kinds are wired is deployment-dependent. The configuration it wires
// through, and the guard that keeps that configuration from falling behind the
// declaration, are jobcensusconfig.go's — this file is what the assembly is
// then held to.
