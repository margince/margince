	//
	// It costs one round trip per live workspace, serially, inside the

	// enqueue that workspace with a zero principal — indistinguishable in the

//     fleet-visible with no RLS, so jobs.FaultContext deliberately replaces an
//     unclassified cause with a fixed sentence before it is stored — the
//     diagnosis belongs where FaultContext already sends it.
//   - CONTAINMENT of the panic value. River's own recovery does not go through
//     FaultContext, so an unrecovered panic writes the unit's raw panic text
//     straight into that fleet-visible column. A third-party unit's panic value
