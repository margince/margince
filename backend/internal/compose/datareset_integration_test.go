// deleteGuardedSweepTargets are the sweep targets whose DELETE-firing trigger

// TestResetKeepsTheDeploymentCredentialsSealedBeforeIt: the mirror image of the
// purge above, and the half that is easy to lose.
//
// The relay password and the license token are sealed into the same vault, but
// their refs live in `setting` rather than in a `credential_ref` column, so the
// purge never collects them — which is correct, because those two must SURVIVE
// a reset. A reset returns the installation to first-boot state without
// re-creating it, and an installation that came back without its license would
// refuse to serve in production over a wipe that was supposed to be routine.
//
// Both halves have to agree: `vault_secret` is in preservedResetTables and both
// entries are marked AsInstallationIdentity. Dropping either marker leaves a ref
// pointing at nothing or a blob nobody names, and neither failure is visible
// until the next boot.
