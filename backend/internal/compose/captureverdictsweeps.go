//
// Judging is the only stage that needs AI. These are the obligations that
// outlive it: a row nobody can process still has to reach a human, a decline
// still has to close the question, mail a judged-noise sender keeps sending
// still has to be hidden, and content already hidden still has to be redacted on
// schedule. Turning AI off is not consent to retain the content of messages the
// workspace already decided were noise.
