// their row's insert (links are write-once with the activity), so they
// are resolved here at insert time; every other edge is applied after
// the row phase, once both endpoints exist. An edge that resolves to
// neither — an endpoint that was skipped, or a shape the native model
// has no target for — is DISCLOSED in the run report rather than
// vanishing.
