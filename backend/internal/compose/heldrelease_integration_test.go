// It runs HERE rather than in the integration package because the executor and
// the wiring that binds it are both unexported, and because the thing under
// test is a TRANSACTION boundary: the redemption that spends a human's
// authority, the send it authorizes, and the parked run's completion all commit
// together or none of them do. No fake approvals engine can say anything about
// that — a stub would answer whatever it was written to answer, and the whole
// question is what the database ends up holding.
//
// The failure this is written against is specific and unrecoverable. Redeem
// first and the approval is consumed by a send that never happened: single-use
// authority spent, a human who saw a 500, and no way to release the message
// again. Send first and a crash leaves mail on the wire that nothing records
// anyone approving.
