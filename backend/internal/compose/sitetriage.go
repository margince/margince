// The domain-triage classifier: what a mail domain's own site says it IS,
// before any organization is created from it.
//
// It runs on the SEED PAGE ALONE, once, before the crawl proper. That is the
// whole point — a personal homepage or a parked domain is obvious from its
// front page, and answering there costs one page instead of twelve plus a
// profile call. A company answer, or an unclear one, falls through to the full
// read, which then produces the dossier the organization is named from.

Answer with ONLY a JSON object: {"kind":one of company|personal|provider|parked|unclear,"confidence":0.0-1.0,"reason":"one short sentence"}

company  — the site of an organization: it sells or offers something, names a team, or presents itself as a business, agency, institution, or association.
personal — the site of ONE individual: a personal homepage, CV, portfolio or blog, or a page whose subject is the person who owns the domain. A one-person business that presents itself AS a business is a company, not personal.
provider — a business selling email mailboxes, web hosting, or domain registration to the general public. Answer this ONLY for the vendor's own site; a company that merely HAS a website is not a provider.
parked   — a registrar placeholder, a "coming soon" or "under construction" page, a bare error page, or a domain-for-sale listing: nothing that identifies anybody.
unclear  — the page does not say. Prefer unclear over guessing; a wrong company or personal answer is worse than no answer.

Judge only what the page states. Do not infer from the domain name.`
