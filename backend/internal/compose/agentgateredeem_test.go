//
// A staged 🟡 call can resolve 🟢 on its retry: the record moved, or the
// per-field split staged an otherwise auto-execute patch. The token that retry
// presents is an assertion of authority, and this door used to read it for
// update_record alone — so for every other tool the approval stayed pending in a
// human's inbox for work that had already happened, and an invalid or replayed
// token was accepted by being ignored.
//
// Admission runs through the real gate and the real tier input, so what these
// assert is what the middleware produces rather than what a hand-set context
// claims.
