// belongs to the human who asked for the read — and the authority on which
// human that is, is the dossier row, not the job payload that travelled beside
// it. Provenance is written once and never re-derived, so getting this wrong
// is not caught downstream.

// run is the whole deep read, River-agnostic so tests drive it directly.
// Retry semantics rest on BeginSiteRead's CAS: any terminal outcome
// (done, partial, failed, cancelled) leaves the dossier past "queued", so a River
// retry — including one after a recorded failure — CAS-misses and
// no-ops. One honest outcome per dossier, no zombie re-crawls; reading
// the site again is a human's next start, never an automatic retry.
// deepReadWorkerCtx attaches the worker's principal, workspace and correlation
// onto the job context — the values every store write (and terminalCtx) needs.
//
// The requester it carries comes from the job payload, because the claim that
// yields the authoritative one needs a context to be made at all. It is
// replaced by withClaimedRequester the moment the row is in hand, so nothing
// the worker writes is attributed on the payload's word.
