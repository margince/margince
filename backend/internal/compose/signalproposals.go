// Turning an observation into an offer (the account-intelligence proposals
// arc).
//
// A signal says what the correspondence stated. It changes nothing. This is
// where the consequence is proposed: an account whose own mail ends the
// contract is OFFERED the move to former_customer, and a human accepts, edits
// or dismisses it. Nothing structural is written before that (GATE-AI-2) —
// the reconciler stages, and the effect writes only once someone has said yes.
//
// The model never stages. This whole file is deterministic: it reads open
// signals and open approvals, and it proposes exactly one thing per open
// contract_ended signal. Whatever the extraction site got wrong is a card
// somebody clears, and a card is where its influence stops.
//
// The precedent is org_name_promotion, not deal_follow_up: StageUnlessDeclined
// (durable rejection memory — StageOrJoinPendingInTx only dedupes against live
// pending rows and forgets rejections) and RedeemAndApply (redemption and the
// write in one transaction).
