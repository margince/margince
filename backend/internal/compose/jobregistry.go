// How the runner hands a worker to River: through the declaration, never
// around it. A worker arrives here as jobs.WorkOnly, so whatever option
// methods it happens to carry are unreachable and api/jobs.yaml is what
// answers River's questions about it.
//
// This is the shared body, not the door. Every registration is written as the
// generated addDeclaredWorker (or its with-timeout form), whose type parameter
// is constrained to the declared set, so a kind api/jobs.yaml has never heard
// of cannot be named at a call site at all.
//
// Three ways around that constraint remain, and each has its own gate,
// because none of them is something the compiler can refuse:
//
//   - Going to River directly. All three of its registration spellings —
//     AddWorker, AddWorkerArgs, AddWorkerSafely — take an unconstrained type
//     parameter and skip jobs.Govern besides, so a worker registered that way
//     answers River's option methods for itself again. forbidigo bans all
//     three outside this file.
//   - Calling addGovernedWorker below, which is constrained only to
//     river.JobArgs. That is what fixtures do, and it is deliberate; the kind
//     it records is what jobs.MustBeTotal refuses to boot on.
//   - Growing a KIND ALIAS on a type that is already declared. River registers
//     the work unit under Kind() and under every alias besides, so the union
//     is satisfied while River works a kind the file never named. The kinds
//     recorded below are therefore all of them, not just the primary.
//
// So the compiler holds the sanctioned path, forbidigo holds the way around
// it, and MustBeTotal holds what is left — including a hand-edited generated
// file, whose union the compiler would believe.
