// business, and an admin's to change from the settings page.

// ProviderRegistryFromEnv builds the adapter registry this process runs with,
// and reports whether one is configured at all.
//
// The DEFAULT is live, because PI-AC-9 requires the surface to REMAIN FULLY
// AVAILABLE with no provider connected — rendering not_connected honestly and
// making no outbound call. Registering an adapter is what puts the card on the
// settings page; it is not what permits egress.
//
// What permits egress is a sealed credential, and nothing else. With no key
// there is no call any adapter could make: Connect verifies before it seals,
// and every submit and poll re-reads the credential under the connection lock
// (poll.go leaseForPoll) and abandons when it is gone. So an admin who has
// never pasted a key is in exactly the zero-egress state, while still being
// able to SEE that the feature exists and connect it themselves.
//
// An earlier version defaulted to off and wired nothing, which made the whole
// capability invisible: the endpoint answered 501 and the settings page showed
// no card, so connecting a provider required an environment variable and a
// server restart. That is a build flag wearing a setting's clothes.
//
// "off" survives for a deployment that wants the code absent entirely, and an
// unknown value is still a boot error — a typo must not silently disable a
// feature an operator asked for, nor silently choose the wrong vendor.
