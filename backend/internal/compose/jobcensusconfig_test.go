// The guard half of the census configuration: everyDeclaredDependencySupplied

// the declaration, and censusSeam is the fake every model/embed lane resolves
// to. Both are exercised here on their failure paths — the success path is
// already pinned by TestJobCensusMatchesTheContract building the census for
// real, which is why this file targets only what that happy path never
// reaches: a config missing a registration or cadence dependency, and a seam
// actually being called.
