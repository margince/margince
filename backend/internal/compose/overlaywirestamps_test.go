// "Recently updated" is a question a user asks of the records, not of the
// sweep. A mirrored record's updated_at must therefore be the incumbent's own
// last-modified instant, which the mapping lands under the canonical
// last_synced_at key from its Baseline property — NOT Record.Freshness.
// LastSyncedAt, the mirror row's ingest time, which every record in a workspace
// shares after one sweep. The two are one word apart and mean opposite things,
// so each entity is held to the canonical one here.
//
// The records are seeded through the REAL mapping for their incumbent class, so
// what is under test is the payload production writes: a hand-built canonical
// fixture would prove only that the wire reads its own author.
