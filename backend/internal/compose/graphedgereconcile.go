// The nightly reconcile for the interaction projection (CG-DDL-1 / ADR-0078).
//
// The consumer keeps the projection current as records change, and that covers
// everything an EVENT can express. It does not cover the one thing nothing
// emits an event for: the passage of time. A 90-day window count goes stale
// because a day passed, not because anybody did anything, so an interaction
// ageing out of the window changes a row that nothing will otherwise rewrite.
// That is the bounded-staleness contract the migration states — counts may be
// up to 24h over-inclusive — and this pass is what bounds it.
//
// It is also the corruption remedy. The projection carries no audit trail on
// purpose, because it holds no fact of its own; whatever state a missed event
// or a half-applied batch left behind, a rebuild from the base tables restores
// the only correct answer.
