// What the REST door OWES the read bound it refuses on.
//
// The admission half lives in agentgate.go: a non-mutating agent call is
// admitted against MCP-SESS-READS before any handler runs. This file is the
// other half — the records that answer actually hands over, charged where they
// leave. A counter a door consults and never increments bounds nobody: a
// credential reading only over /v1 would sit at zero forever, however much it
// read, which is exactly the asymmetry ADR-0055 exists to close.
