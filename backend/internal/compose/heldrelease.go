// Releasing a held draft: the approve-side executor for the message an
// automation composed and a human decided to send.
//
// The whole feature turns on this file doing ONE thing — the ordinary send —
// rather than a second implementation of it. A released draft is not a special
// kind of mail: it is the same send the composer performs, reached by a
// different door, so consent, recipient visibility, the mailbox pre-flight,
// the sign-off, deliverability, the outbound activity, its delivery row and its
// dispatch job are all the ones an ordinary send produces. Anything this file
// derived for itself would be a way for a released draft to differ from the
// message the same human could have typed, and there is no version of that
// which is correct.
//
// Rejection needs nothing here. approvals.Decide already records the reason,
// and automation's own consumer lands the parked run's terminal 'blocked'
// outcome — a discard is complete without this file's involvement.

// heldDraftReleaseEffect builds the approvals.ApprovedEffect compose injects
// for kind held_draft.
//
// THREE things commit together or none of them do: the single-use redemption
// that spends the human's authority, the send itself, and the parked
// automation run's completion. RedeemAndApply owns that transaction and this
// effect only fills it.
//
// Why all three and not just the first two. Each pair left alone is a defect
// this codebase can already name. Redemption without the send is the consumed
// approval whose effect never ran — the failure editscope.go records having
// been paid for once, and unrecoverable here because a send cannot be replayed
// from a spent authority. The send without the run transition leaves history
// claiming an automation is still waiting for a decision that released a
// message days ago. And the send without the redemption is a message nothing
// records anyone approving.
//
// A gate that refuses — consent withdrawn since staging, a sender who lost
// their mailbox, an anchor archived out from under the draft — is answered
// BEFORE any of this, by heldDraftPrecheck below, so the approval is never
// decided and the human can fix the cause and approve the same row again.
// Reaching a refusal from in here means the world moved between the preflight
// and this transaction, which rolls the redemption back but leaves an approved
// row nothing can re-drive — rare by construction, and the reason the preflight
// exists rather than an accepted cost.

// entirely. The inbox has never offered the field; this is what makes that true
// of the API as well.
//
// The PURPOSE. It is the lawful basis the send is made under, chosen by the
// operator when the automation was configured. Editing it at release would let
// somebody re-license a message at the moment of sending it.
// The refusal is approvals' OWN RetargetedEditError, not a new error beside it.
// This is the same violation the edit scope refuses for entity references, in a
// field whose shape that check cannot see — so it should read identically to the
