// groundedDetail keeps a claimed value only when the text it is judged

// census applies the wrong company's legal identity; a detail is judged
// against the entity's own cited block, because a notice lists several
// companies and a sibling's registered address must not attach to the one
// a human then selects.
//
// An address survives a round trip through a model with its punctuation
// rearranged — a block printing "Singapore (179433)" comes back
// "Singapore 179433" — and refusing that costs the human the field they
// came for. So the test is that every content token of the value was
// printed in that text, WHOLE: "1234" is not evidence from a notice that
// printed "HRB 123456", and a truncated register number is a legal
// identifier the company does not have. Substring containment would accept
// exactly that, which is why it is not used.
//
// Block scoping is only as strong as the page's own layout: passages pack
// short lines together, so a legal notice compact enough to fit one

// told apart from this entity's. The human picking from the census remains
