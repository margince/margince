// What the signature-enrich case owes the certification lane: it issues the
// request the pass issues, it judges the reply with the no-guess gate and the
// acceptance floor the pass judges it with, and it separates a reply nothing
// survived from one that survived and says the wrong thing. The two want
// opposite fixes — a fabricating model is a prompt problem, a confidently-wrong
// one is a model choice — and a case that collapsed them could report neither.
//
// The window is the sharp edge here. The model is shown the trailing non-quoted
// lines, never the whole mail, so a case whose gate read the mail would accept a
// quote from a reply the model never saw — and certify a mismatch.
