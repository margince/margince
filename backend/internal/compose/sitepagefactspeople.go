// truth is a relationship rather than a value: the page has to say that THIS
// name holds THIS role, and a name and a role printed near each other are
// routinely two different people's. So this gate works from a quote the model
// copies out of the page — checked verbatim, then checked for reaching over
// somebody else — rather than from where the two strings happen to sit.

// attributionQuote checks the model's claim that the page gives THIS person
// THIS role, and returns the page's own words that say so.
//
// The question a role gate has to answer is attribution, and attribution is
// not a distance. Earlier spellings of this check asked whether the role
// appeared near the name — inside the cited passage, then within one passage
// of it — and every version of that question has the same wrong answer on a
// page that names two people:
//
//	Geschäftsführer Anna Muster … Prokurist Bernd Beispiel
//
// "Prokurist" is near "Anna Muster" by any measure, and it is Bernd's.
// Refining the measure does not help; the information needed to tell the two
// apart is which words the page puts between them, which is what a reader
// uses and what the model is asked for here.
//
// So the model quotes the span joining role to name, and this verifies the
// quote is the page's own text, unedited. That makes the claim checkable
// without the gate having to know how German imprints, English team pages or
// Vietnamese about pages lay themselves out. A model that pads the quote to
// bridge two people is caught by the verbatim check; one that trims the
// people in between is caught by the same check, because the page does not
// read that way either.
//
// The role is held to the same bar as the name. A model that retypes it
// rather than copying it loses the person — billiger.de's reader produced
// "Geschäftsföhrer" for "Geschäftsführer" on one run in three — and that is
// the safe direction to fail, because the next read gets them and a
// near-enough match would be the gate ceasing to gate.

//
// So the model declares it: alongside the quote it lists every other person
// printed inside, and an undeclared companion refuses the claim.
//
// The declaration says one specific thing — these people share the label the
