// The reading has always been right — a stale staging displays as expired. What
// was missing is everything that follows from it: the row still said pending, so
// nothing was audited, nothing was emitted, and an automation parked behind it
// waited on a verdict already taken against it.
//
// These run here rather than in the approvals package because the invariants
// are cross-boundary: the audit row and the outbox event are written by the
// store, and the run transition is carried by a consumer in another module. A
// unit test with a fake engine would prove the call and skip the guarantee.
