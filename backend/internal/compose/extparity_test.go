// The extension twin of the REST guarantee.
//
// For a core operation, `var _ crmcontracts.ServerInterface = Server{}`
// (server.go) makes "declared but not handled" a COMPILE error. Extensions
// cannot have that: crmcontracts is generated from the base contract, which is
// installation-independent by design, so an extension operation is never a
// method on that interface. These two tests are the runtime equivalent, and
// they exist as a PAIR because either alone is satisfied by a surface that is
// wrong in the other direction:
//
//   - a declared verb with no registration is a route the merged contract
//     publishes, the docs describe and a client generates a call for, which
//     answers 404;
//   - a registration nothing declares is a reachable authenticated endpoint no
//     contract, no client type, no doc and no unit manifest knows about — so
//     nothing asks an operator to resolve it either.
//
// Both are asserted against the SAME mounting the composition root performs
// (MountExtensionRoutes on a real ServeMux), through the SAME two functions the
// parent assertions use (unregisteredDeclarations, undeclaredRegistrations), so
// the mutation subtests exercise the sweep rather than an equivalent loop.
//
// THE RESIDUAL, stated because the pair is weaker in one direction than in the
// other and the difference is structural. Direction 1 is checkable outright: a
// declaration is a value, and MountExtensionRoutes either mounted it or did not
// — and the mux.Handler probe confirms the router really resolves it, not just
// that a pattern was recorded. Direction 2 can only see what MountExtensionRoutes
// REPORTS. A mux.Handle call whose pattern is never appended to the returned
// slice is invisible to it, and extensionEdge itself does exactly that with
// mux.Handle("/", next). So direction 2 holds "everything this seam admits to
// mounting was declared", not "nothing else is mounted" — the latter is
// uncheckable because a ServeMux cannot be enumerated. What closes the gap for
// the one unreported registration that exists is
// TestExtensionEdgeFallsThroughToTheCoreRouter, which asserts that "/" reaches
// next rather than serving anything of its own.
//
// A third state sits between "declared" and "registered": a verb the contract
// declares that no unit shipped behavior for. It is mounted and answers 501.
// The sweep distinguishes it rather than collapsing it into either side — see
// MountedRoute.
