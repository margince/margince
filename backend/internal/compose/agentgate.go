// The ADR-0055 REST admission layer. Autonomy admission is
// transport-agnostic: a mutating REST call by an AGENT (Passport)
// principal resolves to the SAME 🟢/🟡 tier declared for its MCP tool twin
// and, when 🟡, stages the SAME approval a refused tool call would —
// approved work is redeemed by repeating the identical request with the
// X-Approval-Token header. The generated agentPolicies table (from the
// contract's x-mcp-tool / x-agent-access annotations) is the op→tier map;
// a mutating route with no entry is REFUSED for agents (fail-closed), and
// human-only governance operations (consent, DSR, pipeline/stage config,
// passport issuance) reject an agent outright — each would let a
// credential widen what a credential may do. Deciding an approval is not
// one of them (ADR-0055): a passport answers on its human's authority,
// bounded by the caps they lent, and never answers the proposal it made
// itself (approvals.agentMayDecide).
//
// Human callers never enter this path: their authority is RBAC at the
// store, and a human's direct call is itself the approval.
