// list_records' filter vocabulary is assembled from two halves that live in
// different repositories of truth — the contract's declared list parameters and
// what a module's store can actually bind — and this is the only layer that can
// see both ends of the wire the halves travel down.
//
// The gate below is about the WIRE, not about either half. Each half has its own
// check where it lives (the generator reads crm.yaml; each module proves every
// filter it declares narrows something). What neither can see is a break
// between them: a provider that stopped delegating, a record type dropped from
// the enumeration set, a registration that never happened. Every one of those
// fails the same way — quietly, with a tool that still answers and simply never
// narrows.

// Every filter a store binds reaches the tool's published schema, UNDER ITS OWN
// RECORD TYPE.
//
// The per-type half is the whole point. Most of these names are shared — four
// of the five types bind `owner_id` — so a check that asked only whether the
// schema mentions a name would stay green with an entire record type dropped
// from the published vocabulary, since its siblings still mention every name it
// had. That is exactly the break this layer exists to catch.
//
// A nil pool is enough: the vocabulary is a property of the code, resolved at
// registration, and no part of answering it touches the database.
