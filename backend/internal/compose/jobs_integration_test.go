// on an idle machine. Whatever it is, it belongs to one wait: see

// It derives that deadline ITSELF rather than taking a context, and the missing
// parameter is the point: a caller used to be able to hand one context to three
// sequential awaits, which is not 30s each but 30s BETWEEN them — whatever the
// first spent, the second went without. That starved the second kind and failed
// a test that passes in ~4s on an idle machine (#1538). With no parameter to
// share, the shape cannot be written again.
//
// This also puts the helper back in line with its two siblings, awaitRows and
// waitUntil, which have always owned their own clocks.
//
// A wait CONSUMES the subscription, and an event it is not waiting for is gone
// once read. So awaiting several kinds by calling this in sequence is only
// sound when each kind cannot complete before the one awaited ahead of it —
// which for jobs enqueued together is not true, and for jobs on different
