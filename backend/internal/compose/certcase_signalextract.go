// The certification case for signal_extract/thread_events.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request comes from extractRequest and the
// reply is judged by validateExtractPayload, the same builder and the same
// validator the engine uses. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy,
// and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the set of events the conversation states,
// each named by the KIND and the POSITION of the message it is stated in.
// Position is the identity the corpus can name, because the ids are minted
// here and never supplied — production takes them from real activity rows no
// model has seen, so an answer can only carry one by having read this call's
// prompt, which is exactly what the citation check exists to prove.
//
// The empty expectation is the important one. Most conversations state no
// material event, and a site that invents one on a quiet thread is worse than
// a silent site — it puts a card in front of a rep for nothing.
