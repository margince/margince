// The claim surface (ADR-0105). It sits on the operational mux beside the
// health probes rather than under /v1, for the reason that shapes everything
// else here: /v1 is fronted by the session middleware, which resolves the
// singleton organization first and answers 503 when there is none. An endpoint
// whose entire purpose is to run when no organization exists cannot live behind
// a gate that requires one.
//
// It is unauthenticated because there is nobody to authenticate yet — the setup
// token is the credential, and without it the route creates nothing.

// setupStatusResponse tells a caller whether this installation is waiting to be
// claimed. It discloses no token and no organization detail: a stranger already
// learns as much from any request that answers 503.
// setupLimiter throttles the pre-tenant edge per client IP, the way every other
// unauthenticated edge on this mux does. Without it an anonymous caller opens a
// transaction and (before the short-circuit in ClaimInstallation) queued on the
// installation advisory lock on every request — a pool connection held for
// free, and the operator's one legitimate claim contending in the same queue.
//
// 20/min is below the booking edge's 60: a human claims an installation once,
// and a client retrying more than that is not the case being served.
