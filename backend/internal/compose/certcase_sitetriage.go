// The certification case for site_triage/triage.
//
// It certifies the shipped path, not a description of it: the request comes
// from triageRequest and the reply is read by gateTriageVerdict, the same two
// the worker uses. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy
// stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What a run measures here is asymmetric, and the scenarios have to be read that
// way. A wrong `company` answer costs one junk record, which is visible and
// deletable. A wrong `personal` or `provider` answer costs a real customer their
// organization, silently. So the corpus weighs a false refusal far more heavily
// than a false company, and `unclear` is a correct answer whenever the page does
// not actually say — the worker reads the whole site in that case and the
// deterministic evidence decides.
