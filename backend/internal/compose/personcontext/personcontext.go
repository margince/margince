// Package personcontext holds the readings of a Person360 that more than one
// prose surface takes.
//
// Three packages fold the same 360 into their own input — the person draft, the
// relationship brief, the pre-meeting brief — and three of the readings were
// byte-identical copies of each other. That is the shape that has already cost
// this program four defects: one list knows something, its copy does not, and
// the two answers diverge without anything failing.
//
// What this package is NOT is a canonical Person360 fold. The three consumers
// genuinely disagree about what they need — the draft models a deal's direction
// as a bool and takes amount and currency only as a pair, the brief allows them
// independently and carries relationship strength — and a shared shape would
// have to be the union of those disagreements, which is a worse thing than
// three honest projections. So only the readings that are the SAME move here,
// and each consumer keeps its own input struct.
