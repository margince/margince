// type only the fan-out classifies is a staged row the inbox strands, which
// nothing then clears.
//
// Two hand-written classifications in two modules that must agree is the shape
// that drifts: each is complete on its own terms, so neither module's own tests
// can see the disagreement. The assertion belongs in the composition layer
// because a module never imports a sibling and this layer imports both.
//
// THE SUBJECT SET IS THE UNION OF THREE SOURCES, and each is there because the
// others cannot see part of the invariant:
//
//   - every record type in the generated policy table — so a type the CONTRACT
//     adds is covered without anybody remembering to extend a list, and so the
//     gate cannot pass vacuously if both enumerators below went empty;
//   - every type the approvals inbox classifies — a target staged by a
//     server-side proposal flow rather than by an agent's call (an effective-dated
//     rate sheet) appears in NO agent policy, so the policy table alone reads
//     green over it;
//   - every type the fan-out classifies — the mirror direction, a type the
//     fan-out delivers on and the inbox strands.
//
// A gate whose subject set is narrower than the invariant it claims reads the
// wrong tree, which is quieter than reading it wrongly.
//
// WHAT IS DERIVED HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT. Two dimensions are derived from the
// union above: that both surfaces classify a type or neither does, and that a
// classified type is an RBAC object a role document may name — the second because
// BOTH surfaces gate a classified target on read of that type, so a type outside
// identity's vocabulary is a floor no principal can pass and a disclosure rule
// that silently means "never".
//
// What this layer canNOT derive is the CONTENT of each surface's floor. Both
// probes are package-internal on purpose (a module does not export its
// authorization internals so a test can drive them), so "do both actually require
// object-read for every type they classify" is not observable from here — which is
// exactly how the two agreed on the vocabulary while disagreeing on the floor.
// That half is gated inside each module, over each module's own classification
// table: the object-read floor by
// approvals.TestEveryClassifiedTargetTypeRequiresReadOnItsOwnType and
// webhooks.TestEveryClassifiedApprovalTargetRidesTheObjectReadFloor, and the one
// classification that floor is NOT enough for — a staged create against a
// personal table, bounded by the member it was staged for — by each module's
