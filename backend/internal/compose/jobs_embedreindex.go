// River wiring for the fleet-wide embed reindex (ADR-0068 design §5.6-swap): a
// dispatcher over every LIVE workspace and a worker that re-embeds one tenant's
// corpus. It registers itself, so jobs.go — which owns the runner's assembly —
// grows one line as this surface does. There is no periodic entry: a reindex is
// a human's confirm at the transport beside this file, never a cadence.
//
// The binding marker is what makes the run one run. The confirm claims it under a
// freshly minted run id, this dispatcher seeds the marker's pending set with the
// fleet and enqueues the children in the same transaction, and each child leaves
// that set when it reaches a terminal outcome. The child that empties it hands
// the marker back. So the marker is held for as long as the RUN has outstanding
// work, not for as long as any one job row is alive — and every MARKER write
// fences on the run id the job carries, so a straggler of a finished run cannot
// move the marker. It still does its own embedding work; only its bookkeeping is
// neutered (search.ReembedClaim.StealAfter states what that costs).

// embedReindexMaxAttempts is the retry budget of a run's DISPATCHER half; the
// workspace half declares the same number in api/jobs.yaml, which is what the
// fan-out reads, and the two are one decision stated in the two places their
// owners live (a confirm's insert here, the contract there).
//
// Unlike every periodic pass beside it, this kind has NO tick to fall back on:
// nothing re-enqueues a lost workspace until a human confirms a reindex again,
// so the three attempts its periodic siblings take — a number chosen because
// the dispatcher's tick IS the real retry cadence — would quietly cost that
// tenant its pass. Five attempts on River's attempt⁴ backoff spans roughly six
// minutes, enough to ride
// out an embed provider's blip or a database restart, and a workspace still
// failing after that is a defect a human should see rather than model budget the
// run keeps spending. Both halves hand the marker back on their way out of a
// terminal outcome, so the operator's re-confirm is normally available at once
// rather than an hour later — normally, not always: that hand-back is a write to
// the same database whose failure is the likeliest reason the attempt failed at
// all, and the exhausted attempt has nothing left to retry it with. The marker
// then stays held until a forced confirm takes it
// (search.ReembedClaim.StealAfter), which is a recovery an hour away rather than
// a wedge.
