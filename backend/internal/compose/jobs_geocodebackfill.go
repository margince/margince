// The geocoding backfill: the pass that reaches companies an address write
// never will.
//
// Geocoding fires when an address is WRITTEN, which is the right trigger and a
// complete answer only for a company written after this installation had a
// geocoder. A seeded workspace, an import that ran last month, or an operator
// setting MARGINCE_GEOCODE_BASE_URL on a system that already holds its
// customers all leave rows nothing will ever write again — invisible to the
// trigger, and so never located. `within_radius` then answers from an empty
// set while looking exactly like a query that works.
//
// It NOMINATES, it does not decide. Each candidate goes to the same
// geocode_organization job an address write queues, and that worker re-asks
// AddressForGeocode — so the retry ledger, the settled-address rule and the
// attempt cap stay in one place rather than being restated here.
