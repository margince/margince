// The REST door's half of the two commands one tool serves through TWO
// contract operations (margince/margince#928 task 7): merge_records is
// mergePerson and mergeOrganization, and enrich is scrapeCompany and
// deepReadCompany.
//
// Both are where this door was previously answering the WRONG question, and in
// two different ways. A merge's route walk read the routed {id} as the staged
// target, but that id is the record merged FROM — the one about to be archived
// — while the approval belongs on the survivor the body names. And the two
// enrich routes are one verb at two depths, distinguishable by nothing on the
// wire except which path was taken, so a target derived from the route could
// never say which of the two a human was releasing.

// mergeCommand decodes POST /v1/people/{id}/merge and
// POST /v1/organizations/{id}/merge.
//
// The routed {id} is the SOURCE and the body's `target_id` is the survivor:
// crm.yaml says so ("The surviving person (B). This row (A) is archived") and
// the handler does the same (people.Handlers.MergePerson passes the path id as
// the source). So this is where the two doors stop disagreeing: the tool door
// has always pinned the survivor, and this door pinned whichever row the route
// happened to name.
//
// The record type comes off the route's own policy entry rather than being
// written here a second time — the entry is generated from the contract's
// x-mcp-tool annotation, so a type spelled again in this file could disagree
// with the one the gate admitted against.
