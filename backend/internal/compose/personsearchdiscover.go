// Discovering a contact's public professional address from SEARCH RESULT
// METADATA, without fetching the page it points at (ADR-0081 / A126).
//
// This is the narrow, deterministic half of search-backed enrichment, and it
// is deliberately the half that needs no model. A search index returns a
// title, a description and a URL; when that URL is a public professional
// profile, the URL itself is the fact worth keeping, and the title and
// description are the receipt. Nothing reads the profile.
//
// That distinction is the whole reason the seam was worth ratifying. The
// platform's terms prohibit automated collection, so websearch.MayFetch
// refuses it — while the address remains perfectly citable, because a
// citation asserts only that the claim appears there. Throwing the URL away
// to honour a rule about FETCHING would discard exactly the field this
// product decided was most worth carrying (ADR-0078 §8: the profile URL is
// the one thing a ghost ever contributes to a real record).
//
// The richer half — reading a role out of a snippet — needs a declared AI
// task, and ai-tasks.yaml is generated from the ratified contract. It waits
// on that reconciliation rather than being smuggled in here.
