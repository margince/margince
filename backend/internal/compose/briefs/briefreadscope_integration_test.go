package briefs

// A persisted brief item is a REFERENCE to a deal, held for as long as the run
// lives — so the read that hands it back composes the deal's read predicate
// rather than trusting the ranking that queued it. A deal is workspace-shared
// identity (platform/auth tableclass.go): reassigning it to another team does
// not take it out of a team-scoped rep's brief, and the rep reads the same
// answer from the brief that `read_record` gives them on the same id.
