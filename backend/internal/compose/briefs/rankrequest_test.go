// What the L2 ranker's exported surface owes its callers. RankRequest,
// ParseRankOrder and BoundToCandidates are published so the certification lane
// can issue the request this ranker issues and read the reply the way this
// ranker reads it; published surface is a promise, and these are the tests that
// hold it.
//
// The promise that matters most here is an absence: this prompt renders only
// machine-made values, which is why it declares no data boundary. The user turn
// is therefore pinned byte-for-byte — a new field cannot be added to it without
// failing this test, and whoever fixes the test has to decide, right there,
// whether what they are adding is something a counterparty wrote.
