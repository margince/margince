// The L2 Morning-Brief ranker (B-E05.2, formulas-and-rules §10): the
// model layer re-orders the deterministic §10.1 candidate set within
// itself. It is advisory over a real floor (ADR-0009 — L2 over the graph,
// no frontier reinvention): the model may re-order but can never inject a
// deal below the §10 cutoff, drop the set below it, or ship a claim with
// no evidence. That guarantee is enforced HERE, deterministically, in
// BoundToCandidates — not trusted to the model. When the model is
// unavailable or answers malformed, the ranker returns the deterministic
// composite order unchanged (the AI-off fallback rank, §10.1).

Each candidate carries a deterministic feature vector (each factor 0..1): winnability, revenue, timing, momentum (overnight change), warmth (strongest stakeholder). Higher is more worth acting on today.
Re-order the deals best-first using judgment the flat weighted score cannot capture (e.g. a fresh overnight reply on a high-value deal outranks a slightly higher static score).
Return ONLY a JSON object {"order":[deal_id,...]} listing EVERY given deal id exactly once, best-first. Never invent an id, never drop one, never add commentary.`
