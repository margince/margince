// The durable half of the MCP Tasks extension: the agent_task rows behind the
// handle a staged confirm-first call hands back.
//
// The store lives here rather than in modules/agents for the reason the
// idempotency claim does — that package declares seams and owns no SQL — and a
// task is operational state of the same class as the claim: it records what a
// surface did, never what the business knows. So no audit row, no outbox row.
// The effect a task performs is executed through Registry.Invoke and carries
// the full write shape there.
//
// EVERY QUERY IS SCOPED TO THE CALLING PASSPORT, in the SQL rather than by a
// caller remembering to filter. A task belonging to another passport is absent,
// not forbidden: distinguishing the two would tell a caller which ids exist.

// (approvals.StageAgentCall) instead of a fresh one, and there is exactly one

// insert fail would drop the agent back to a bare refusal and lose the handle it
// had.

// task leaves the approval approved and unspent — Withdraw is a no-op against a
// decided one — so within the redemption window the identical call is handed that
// same approval, and answering it with a "cancelled" handle would hide a decision
