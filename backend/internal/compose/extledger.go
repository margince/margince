// The core's half of extension.Tx.Record: the ledger row and the bus event a
// unit's OWN write records, written through the product's own storekit seam on
// the transaction the unit already holds.
//
// Everything here is a translation and a set of refusals. The WRITES are
// storekit.Audit and storekit.Emit — the same two calls every module store
// makes — so the actor resolution, the workspace binding, the attribution merge
// and the envelope validation are inherited rather than re-implemented. What
// this file adds is the one thing storekit cannot know: which unit is asking,
// and therefore which rows and which event names are its own to write.
