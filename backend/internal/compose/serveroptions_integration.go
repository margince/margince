// WithOverlayIncumbentResolver is a test-only Option, gated behind the
// integration build tag so it can never link into a production binary
// (cmd/api, cmd/worker, cmd/mcp build untagged). No cmd/ role calls it —
// every real deployment reaches HubSpot only through WithKeyvault's
// vaulted region+token path. It exists because compose.New returns a bare
// http.Handler (nothing exposes Server or its Dispatcher to a caller
// outside this package) and the integration suite that exercises the
// write-back seam over the real HTTP surface needs to substitute
// overlay/fake for the live hubspot.Adapter WithKeyvault would otherwise
// build — there is no other seam to reach that resolver from outside
// compose.
