// logoCandidates builds the ordered, deduplicated candidate chain from what
// the seed page declared plus the well-known favicon path every site answers
// whether it declares one or not.
//
// A candidate may live on ANOTHER host, and that is a deliberate departure
// from the crawl's off-domain rule (sitecrawlwave.go, which refuses to follow
// page content off the seed's site). It is a departure because a mark
// routinely is CDN-hosted — afs.de serves its logo from CloudFront, stripe.com
// from its asset host — and refusing those would leave exactly the companies
// with the most deliberate branding wearing a monogram.
//
// What makes the departure narrow rather than an open relay: the fetch is a
// GET of BYTES that are only ever decoded as an image, never read as content
// and never followed; the target host's own robots.txt still governs it; the
// SSRF dialer still refuses non-public addresses; and the chain is bounded to
// logoMaxCandidates fetches of maxAssetBytes each, so one read's whole asset
// egress is bounded whatever a page declares. Every candidate tried, off-host
// ones included, is named in the report.
