// Putting a deal's coverage risks into the assembled context (ADR-0078).
//
// The risk rules live in compose/network because every one of them joins deals,
// people and the interaction projection, and a module never imports a sibling.
// The retriever lives in search. So the assistant summarising a deal could see
// its timeline and its related records, and could not see that the account has
// been silent for six weeks or that the champion has left — the two facts a
// human would lead with.
//
// This is the join, made where every cross-module edge in this codebase is
// made. It decorates the retriever rather than widening the seam: the
// retrieval port stays a port, and search keeps knowing nothing about deals.
