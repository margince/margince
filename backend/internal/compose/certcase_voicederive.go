// The certification case for voice_build/derive — the one model pass a voice
// build makes over the author's own corpus, and the profile every later voiced
// draft is written from.
//
// It certifies the shipped path in the strongest form this census has: Run calls
// ai.DeriveVoice, the exported entry point the build worker calls, through the
// brain seam that entry point already takes. Nothing here re-creates anything —
// the prompt, the per-call boundary, the response schema and the validator are
// the build's own, reached by running the build rather than by copying it. That
// certifies MORE than an exported request builder would: a case built around a
// lifted builder would still leave the validator, the schema and the order they
// run in outside the claim, and a copy stays green through the change that
// breaks the original.
//
// It is also why nothing in modules/ai is exported for it. The seam that runs
// the whole path already exists, so widening the module's surface to reach one
// piece of it would buy a weaker claim at the price of a wider module.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is which of the author's own samples the
// derived profile grounds its signature moves in. The rest of a profile is
// prose — how the author thinks, what they avoid — and pinning sentences would
// fail every model that said the same thing differently, which is what the
// rubric and the judge are for. The grounding is not prose: the build demands
// that every signature move quote a verbatim fragment and name the sample it
// came from, so a scenario can say which sample carries the style it is about
// and a profile that invented one cannot satisfy it.
//
// The quote itself is deliberately NOT the expectation. Which fragment of a
// sample proves a move is the model's own reading, and a scenario naming one
// would fail a profile that found an equally verbatim fragment two lines down —
// while a scenario naming a fragment no sample contains could never be satisfied
// at all, because the build refuses a quote it cannot find in the cited sample.
