package compose

// Whether the voice learning loop is WIRED, proven against a real database.
// This is the composition's own obligation and nothing else can carry it: the
// recorder answers every refusal with silence and a nil recorder is a
// deliberate no-op, so a send path composed without one behaves exactly like
// one composed with it — every module test still passes while the feature
// records nothing, forever. So these cases assert the row, never the absence
// of an error.
//
// Both stores the send path's file comment names are driven here. The tool
// surface's store is driven directly rather than through commsAdapter because
// agents.SendEmailArgs deliberately carries no draft reference (comms.go) —
// what the two transports share is the STORE, so that is where "both carry
// the recorder" is a statement about the wiring rather than about one
// transport's request shape.
