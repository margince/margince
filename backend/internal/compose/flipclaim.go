// The flip's mutual exclusion: one cutover at a time per workspace, and
// the liveness signal Disconnect reads off the same lock.
//
// Why a lock rather than a status column: the import pages the frozen
// mirror with a positional cursor, so any concurrent request that
// unseals mid-run would let the estate drift under it and silently drop
// a row per insert. And liveness has to die with the session — a run
// record left at `running` by a cancelled request would otherwise block
// the only path that revokes the incumbent credential, forever.
