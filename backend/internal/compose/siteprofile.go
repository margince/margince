// snippet id into a GLOBALLY numbered excerpt corpus, so the resolver —
// never the model — determines which page a citation belongs to: the
// model cannot even name a page, let alone launder evidence onto one.
// Verbatim-shaped fields (display name, the legal trio) demand their
// value in the cited passage; paraphrase fields store the resolved
// passage as evidence with a warning-only overlap check — the same
// page-membership guarantee the old verbatim quote gave, at a tenth of
