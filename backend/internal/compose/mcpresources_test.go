// The App sweeps beside this file compose ONE provider — the views, with a nil
// vocabulary — because that is the wiring they are about. Which means they never
// reach the composite at all, and the code that decides which of two providers
// answers a URI would have gone in with no test over it. That is the shape a
// coverage read is for.
//
// The two providers here are stubs at a true seam (mcp.ResourceProvider), which
// is what a stub is for: the behaviour under test is the composition's, and a
// real provider would only make the failures harder to read.
