// The 🟡 loop on the REST door: how a confirm-first call is staged for a human,
// and how the retry that carries their decision is redeemed.
//
// Split from agentgate.go on the 500-line cap, along the boundary that was
// already there: agentgate.go decides whether a call is ADMITTED, and this is
// what happens to the one answer that is neither yes nor no. The MCP door's
// twin of this file is modules/agents/approvals.go, and the two must agree on
// what "the identical call" means even though each hashes it through its own
// spelling — the MCP door through shared/kernel/diffhash
// (modules/agents/reserved.go), this door through its own canonicalRESTCall
// (agentgatecanon.go), because a REST call carries a method, a concrete path
// and headers that a tool call's arguments object has no place for.

// should stop, `ran` says a handler actually executed. They differ on every
// refusal path — a malformed token is handled and ran nothing — and the
// difference is what decides whether an effect is charged. Reading one off the

// and pinAutoExecutedWrite already refused an If-Match naming a version it did
// not read, while a 🟡 call was admitted by a human's decision and this door hashes
