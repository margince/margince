// re-fetch per row, and the queue — not the budget the meter guards at
// execution — would carry the whole estate. Bounded, a pass takes a prefix and
// leaves the rest for the next one, which is what makes convergence a matter
// of passes rather than of one burst.
//
// It is deliberately NOT MARGINCE_OVERLAY_BACKFILL_LIMIT: that knob is a
// dev/demo cap on the initial load and is unset in production, so bounding
// re-projection by it would mean "unbounded" in exactly the deployment that
// needs the bound.
//
// 200 bounds the QUEUE, and is not a throughput promise: what governs how fast
// a class converges is the incumbent's DAILY REST allocation. Every re-fetch
// enqueued here reserves one REST unit against SourceForceFresh before its live
// read (jobs_overlay_refetch.go), and the meter sheds on the whole UTC day's
// REST total across every source — with the built-in HubSpot budget
// (deployconfig/overlaybudget.go: a 90,000 cap, shed at 0.90 of it) that is
// ~81,000 live reads a day, shared with the poller's own spend and with
// interactive force-fresh. So a class holding more stale rows than the day's
// remaining allocation cannot converge inside that day however often the sweep
// ticks, and a mapping change is felt past the flip: it drives the shared daily
// total toward the shed band, where interactive force-fresh degrades to
// mirror-with-staleness (AC-OV-7) for the rest of the UTC day. What the bound
// buys is that the spend arrives as a trickle the meter can arbitrate against
// live reads, rather than as a queue the sweep has already committed to.

// produce — and the flip freezes the mirror and writes whatever a row holds as
// a durable native row. The flip preflight refuses exactly these rows
// (overlay's projectionstaleness.go); this phase is what clears them, so that
// block is temporary rather than permanent.
//
// It runs LAST, after the watermark phases, so freshness and the incumbent
// budget keep priority: an estate under budget pressure stays fresh while it
// converges slowly, and the flip stays blocked meanwhile, which is correct.
//
// It needs no cursor of its own. Ingest stamps the fingerprint of the

// as its re-fetch lands; successive passes select the next rows still in it,

//
