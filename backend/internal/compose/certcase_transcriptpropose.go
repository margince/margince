// The certification case for transcript_propose/next_steps.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request comes from transcriptRequest and
// the reply is judged by validateTranscriptPayload, the same builder and the
// same validator the engine uses. A case that rebuilt either would measure a
// copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the set of next steps the transcript states,
// each named by the LINE it is stated on. The line number is an identity the
// corpus can name because the transcript itself supplies it — unlike the thread
// read, this site mints nothing, so a scenario author counts lines in the
// fixture and writes the number down. An answer can only carry a line number by
// having read this call's prompt, which is what the citation check exists to
// prove.
//
// The empty expectation is the important one. Most meetings state no
// commitment anyone could act on, and a site that invents one puts a question in
// front of a rep that the transcript never asked.
