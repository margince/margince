// Package personresearch runs the deep-research surface on a person
// (ADR-0096 Decision 4, UC-E04-02 as amended).
//
// NOTHING IS WRITTEN BEFORE AN EXPLICIT SAVE. A run stages: it returns claims
// and touches no record. The record changes only when a human reviews the
// staged set and accepts specific claims, and the accepted ones land in
// person_profile_field through the audited write shape — the same table the
// signature-enrichment pass fills, whose evidence_snippet and source_ref are
// both NOT NULL, so a claim that lost its quote or its source cannot be stored
// at all.
//
// The zero-write guarantee is STRUCTURAL, not a rule this package remembers:
// running a research pass needs no store with a write method, so the service
// that runs one does not hold one. Only Save does.
//
// With no provider registered the surface answers "not connected" and stops.
// That is a named state, not an error to retry: retrying changes nothing, and
// a spinner over an absent provider is a lie about what the product is doing.
