// "human-typed" is a property of the audit trail, not of a separate
// per-field provenance store — a field is human-owned if the most
// recent write of its CURRENT value had actor_type=human. The audit
// before/after images are already per-field (storekit.Patch records
// changed columns), so one indexed scan answers the question.

// HumanOwnedConflicts names the patch fields whose latest audited write

// history at all. Equal values are never a conflict: re-stating what the
// human already typed overwrites nothing.
//
// That second clause is the fail-closed half, and it exists because the
// create paths do not audit what the human typed. Each of them records a
// single headline key — {name} for a deal, {full_name} for a person,
// {display_name} for an organization — while the UPDATE paths record the
// real per-field before/after images. So the premise this file opens with
// holds for updates and is false for creates, and a deal a human created
// in the shipped form (which sends name, amount_minor, currency,
// expected_close_date and the custom fields in ONE post) had exactly one
// protected field and the rest unguarded. An agent could rewrite the money
// and the forecast date at the auto-execute tier with no approval staged.
//
// The unaudited half is narrowed by the record's CURRENT value, read from
// the row itself: a field that is still empty has nothing a human could
// have typed and nothing an agent could undo, so filling it stays 🟢. A
// field that already holds a value on a human-created record might be that
// human's, the trail cannot say, and the tie goes to asking them.
