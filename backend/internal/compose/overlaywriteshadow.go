// The overlay-mode human write surface (design.md §4.5, the write-back half
// of "Overlay does not fork the data API"): Server shadows the contract
// update/archive ops for the write verbs overlay.SupportsWrite reports true
// — update on all five mirror entity types, archive on person/organization/
// deal — routing them through the SAME Dispatcher the MCP/agent seam
// consumers ride, and delegating to the native module handler otherwise.
// The overlaywrite.go guard already refuses every write the provider cannot
// serve (create; archive on lead/activity) before it reaches a handler at
// all, so no shadow exists here for those — see that file's own doc.
//
// Every write here is incumbent-first (overlay.Provider.Update/Archive):
// HubSpot accepts the change before anything lands back in the mirror, so a
// refusal upstream never leaves a local row claiming a write the incumbent
// never took. The response is always the RE-MIRRORED row, assembled by the
// same overlayWire* mapper the read shadows use, so a write and a
// following GET answer one shape.

// shape (200 with the full entity body; architecture/11 §8 rules out a bare
// 204 for a domain row, and every native ArchivePerson/ArchiveOrganization/
// ArchiveDeal handler answers exactly that). The mirror row is purged by the
// archive itself (provider_writes.go's Archive calls PurgeRecord), so
// unlike overlayUpdate there is no read-BACK to ride: the record is read
// once, BEFORE the purge, and that pre-archive snapshot is what wire
// assembles — still a read, still carrying the same row-scope/object gate
// (Provider.Read's own auth.Require), just ordered before rather than after
// the write.
//
// markArchived stamps the archive instant onto the assembled body, so the
// 200 describes the record as it is AFTER the call rather than as it was
// before. Without it the response carries archived_at: null about a record
// the incumbent has just archived — the contract defines the archive
// response as one that "now carries a non-null archived_at", and answering
// otherwise reports the write as not having happened.
//
// The instant is this server's own: the incumbent acks the archive without
// reporting when it applied it, so the honest available value is when we
// observed it, accurate to the width of the call.
//
// The contract's other archive promise — that the archived row stays
// fetchable by id — is NOT met here, and cannot be by this transport: the
// mirror row is purged, so the following GET answers 404. An incumbent
// archive stops serving the object at the source, so the mirror has no
// archived state to keep; honoring that promise needs an archived-row
// substrate and a settled answer to what archive MEANS when the system of
// record is an incumbent. Both are open contract questions. This shadow does
// not paper over the gap by pretending the record is still there, and the
// integration test asserts the 404 so the day that answer lands, it fails
// loudly.
//
// The body can also be stale by the width of the pre-read-then-archive
// window — an incumbent update landing in that gap is not reflected —
// whereas the native path reads and archives in one transaction.
