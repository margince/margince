// What the offer-draft case owes the certification lane: it issues the request
// the orchestrator issues, it judges the reply with the no-guess gate AND the
// price ladder the orchestrator judges it with, and it separates the three
// things a reply can be. A deal's context is the counterparty's own words, so
// "nothing could be staged" and "the price is wrong" fail for opposite reasons
// and want opposite fixes.
//
// The rate-card rung is exercised here rather than left to the integration lane
// because it is half the gate: a case that stopped at the evidence check would
// certify that a line is grounded while saying nothing about the number on it.
