// The ONE place a dispatcher's schedule is built. A periodic entry answers
// three separate questions — does this kind register at all, on what cadence,
// and is there a cadence to place — and api/jobs.yaml states all three per
// kind. Resolving them here rather than at each wiring site is what stops a
// schedule from being a property of where a call happens to sit: a nested
// guard reads as a rule about the enclosing block, and the rule is the
// declaration's.

// on this boot's configuration and on nothing about the caller, so moving a
// wiring site cannot quietly move a schedule with it.
//
// RunOnStart is not a per-kind choice. Every pass scheduled here is a catch-up
// over a backlog that accrued while nobody was working it, and deferring the
// first pass by a whole interval after a restart is wrong for all of them: a
// retention pass would sit out a window it was already too late for, and a
// webhook backoff that elapsed during the outage would wait out a second one.

// scheduleInterval resolves a declared cadence to the interval River schedules

//   - on demand — a human's confirm enqueues this dispatcher and no clock ever
//     does, so there is no entry to place. Declared rather than inferred,
//     because a schedule someone forgot looks otherwise identical.
//   - schedule when positive — the kind stays wired and only the tick goes
//     away. River offers no cadence for a non-positive duration and refuses
//     none either: PeriodicInterval(0) yields Next(t) == t, so the enqueuer
//     re-derives a run time that never advances and dispatches as fast as
//     Postgres accepts an insert. Only the kinds that DECLARE this read a
