// The certification case for draft_reply/reply — the email the product drafts
// for a human to review, in the account owner's own voice where one has been
// built.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it, and here that
// means driving the drafter itself: Run calls completeVoiced, the method the
// transport calls, and lets it decide how many calls this draft takes. That
// decision is the site. A case that issued one request and graded the answer
// would certify the opening attempt of a path whose served draft routinely comes
// from the second or the third.
//
// The site is registered one_shot and issues up to three calls, and both are
// true: the kind names the conversation — no turn of this one is replayed from a
// human — while the retry and the fallback are the product talking to itself.
// Trace.Requests carries all of them, which is what the canary gate reads and
// what a record must show to be about the prompt the draft came from.
//
// ONE site, two system variants. A workspace with a built Voice DNA profile
// sends the voice prompt with the profile block inside the call's own boundary;
// a workspace without one sends the plain prompt. The fixture's voice artifact
// is what selects between them, exactly as the workspace's stored state selects
// between them in production — which is what the task contract's own doc: for
// draft_reply says, and why this is not two sites.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is the REGISTER the product served the draft
// in: "voiced" or "plain". The draft is free prose and the reply schema offers
// no closed vocabulary to pin instead — pinning its sentences would fail every
// model that said the same thing differently, and that is what the rubric and
// the judge are for. What the product itself reads off a served draft is which
// variant produced it: DraftEmailWithProvenance stamps the voice profile version
// and a draft ref only for a voice-styled draft that cleared the deterministic
// anti-AI floor, and serves the plain fallback unstamped. That one bit is
// decided by the three calls this site makes, so it is the bit a scenario can
// assert and the bit worth asserting.
