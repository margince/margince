// It is a PARAMETER rather than a second canonicalization function because

	// The approved retry therefore cannot present the key again. Re-using it
	// never reaches the gate at all — the idempotency middleware sits
	// outside it (routes.go) and answers the retry's residue body as a
	// digest mismatch, 409. Presenting no key, which is what the staging
	// note instructs, is then the only retry that can arrive; hashing a key
	// it cannot carry would make the human's approval permanently
	// unredeemable and the withheld field permanently unwritable.
	//
	// This is the same judgment canonicalHeaders already makes for If-Match

// whether a retry is a fresh effect, a replay or a conflict, and it reaches
// the handler exactly as the caller sent it — on every path where the retry
// can still present it (idempotencyKeyBinding, above).
//
// If-Match is deliberately NOT here, though it is also execution-relevant.
// On the redemption path the gate OVERWRITES the caller's If-Match with the
// server-side version pin taken at staging time (agentgatestaging.go,
// redeemIfPresented) before the handler ever reads it, and on the
// field-ownership split path (agentsplit.go) the auto-execute half can
// advance the record's version between staging and redemption while the
// staged residue's hash must still match on retry — hashing If-Match would
// make that retry unredeemable by the version the agent just saw, without
// protecting anything the server-side pin does not already protect.
//
// Every other header (Authorization, User-Agent, tracing headers, …) is
// excluded for the same reason it always was: hashing one would make an
// approval unredeemable from a different client, which is a worse bug than
// the one this guards against.

// canonicalRESTCall canonicalizes the request into the bytes both staging
// and redemption hash: decoding into maps and re-marshaling sorts keys at
// every depth and folds equivalent number spellings ("1" vs "1.0" vs "1e0")
// to the same value, so "identical call" is a property of content, not of
// the client's serialization habits. The decode into `any` also draws the
// one-value boundary this tree already draws elsewhere (httperr.Decode,
// modules/agents/badargs.go): a body carrying trailing content after the
// JSON value — `{"a":1} garbage`, `{"a":1}{"b":2}` — is refused rather than
// silently truncated to its first value.
//
// The `headers` member is present only when canonicalHeaders found
// something to carry: a call presenting no hashed header canonicalizes
// byte-for-byte as it did before this member existed, so a REST-agent
// approval or redemption token minted before headers joined the hash stays
// redeemable. Adding the empty member unconditionally would have changed
// the hash of every call, headered or not.
//
// That same absence is what lets ONE function serve both bindings.
// Redemption cannot know which kind of approval it is about to redeem — it
// computes a hash before it has read the row — so it always canonicalizes
// with keyBindsTheRetry. A residue retry arrives carrying no key (its own
// binding's doc says why it can carry no other), canonicalizes with no
// `headers` member, and matches the residue staged without one; a
// full-request retry arrives carrying the key it always could and matches
// the staging that hashed it. The two agree without redemption having to
// ask which it is looking at.
//
// UTF-8 is checked on both sides of the decode, matching the tool door's
// two-halved check (modules/agents/reserved.go): utf8.Valid on the raw
// bytes catches malformed encoding BEFORE the decode destroys the evidence
// (encoding/json replaces an invalid byte with U+FFFD, so two different
// wire bodies would arrive as one string); the replacement-rune scan on the
// canonical form catches an escaped unpaired surrogate (`"\udcff"`), which
// is valid UTF-8 on the wire and still decodes to U+FFFD, so the byte check
// cannot see it.
