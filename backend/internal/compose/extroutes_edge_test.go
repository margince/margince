// extensionEdge is the one line in this change with a security property, and
// its own comment says so: mount the composed extension routes on the
// OPERATIONAL mux and ServeMux's longest-pattern-wins rule makes "/v1/ext/…"
// beat the "/v1/" entry that carries authH.Middleware — every extension route
// would then serve with no session and no workspace. These tests hold the three
// properties that make the nesting real:
//
//  1. an extension route is behind the session middleware (asserted through the
//     assembled operational mux, not by reading the wiring);
//  2. the "/" fall-through reaches the core router untouched;
//  3. the edge mounts exactly what ComposedVerbs() declares, and vanishes when
//     there is nothing to mount.
