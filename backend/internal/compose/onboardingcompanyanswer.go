// The two halves of the onboarding company conversation's model call: the
// request it sends, and the gate it judges the answer with. They sit together,
// and apart from the assistant that calls them, because they are one seam with
// two callers — the administrator's live setup conversation and the
// certification lane that measures it. A lane that rebuilt either half would
// measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the
// original.
//
// This conversation is the dossier conversation plus the wizard's own state, and
// the difference is the whole reason it is a separate site: the model is shown
// the resumable draft and the deterministic completion plan next to crawled web
// text, and the administrator may answer the plan's next question with a bare
// value that names no field at all.
