// The unit's own transaction: opening one, and the one thing holding one
// forbids.
//
// It sits apart from the Runtime's other capabilities because the two halves
// here are one fact read from opposite ends. Tx hands a unit a transaction on
// the invocation's tenant; the counter beside it is how the INGRESS port knows
// one is open, since capture opens a transaction of its own and a second
// acquire inside the first does not fail on a small pool — it waits for a
// connection this Runtime is holding.

// The refusal is the other half of insideTx's, and without it the pair is a

// and then handed its record to capture would have capture's transaction opened
// AFTER a sibling goroutine took the pool's connection through Tx, which is
// exactly the wait the check exists to prevent. Claimed under one lock, in both
// directions, the two are mutually exclusive per runtime — and a handler that
// genuinely needs both does them one after the other, which is what the poll's
