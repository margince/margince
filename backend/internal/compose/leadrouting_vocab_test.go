// The routable-lead-field vocabulary lives in two modules that cannot

// they drift, a config the editor accepts silently never matches (the
// engine's field lookup returns "" for an unknown key), or the editor
// 422s a field the engine now supports. Compose is the only place both
// are visible, so the binding lives here — derive the obligation, don't
// maintain two hand-synced lists.
