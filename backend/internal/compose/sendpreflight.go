// The request-time send pre-flight, over the SAME capture registry the connect
// flows write to (telegram-oa design §8.1). It sits apart from the transmit lane
// in commsjobs.go because it answers a different question at a different moment:
// not "which credential carries this delivery", but "is there a credential at
// all", asked while the person who can do something about the answer is still on
// the screen.
//
// Which table holds that credential is the whole subtlety, and it is why this is
// one type with one branch rather than two authorities: a mailbox is one human's
// OAuth grant in capture_connection, a bot is the workspace's binding in
// channel_connection, and a pre-flight that asked the mailbox question about a bot
// refuses every channel reply with a 422 about a mailbox nobody mentioned.

// for whichever transport it was not built for.

// For a mailbox it asks about the GRANT, not the connection. Every mailbox
// connected before the send scope existed holds read-only access until its owner

// the token IS the authority — so the live binding is the whole answer.

// DEPLOYMENT configured a mail app for the provider at all. A grant is the

// whose app was never configured reports its send scope exactly as a working
