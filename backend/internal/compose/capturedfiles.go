// The edge between capture and the timeline's attachment store.
//
// Capture reads the mailbox and owns the transaction; activities owns the
// attachment table. Neither imports the other, so the join is here — the same
// arrangement the counterparty ensurer already uses, and the reason the
// table-ownership fitness test passes with one writer per table.
