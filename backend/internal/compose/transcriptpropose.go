// Reading one meeting transcript for the next steps in it (S-E04.3), and
// staging each as a question a human answers.
//
// What this site may claim is bounded by what a transcript IS: a record of what
// people said. So a proposal here is always "somebody said they would do this",
// never "this deal should move to negotiation" — the second is a conclusion
// about the account, and nothing in a transcript states it. Every proposal
// cites the lines it was read from and writes NOTHING until a human accepts it
// (GATE-AI-2); accepting creates one task activity through the same RBAC-gated
// write a rep's own "add task" takes.
//
// It mirrors signalextract.go deliberately — same fenced prompt, same pure
// request builder, same validator-then-floor split — because the two sites do
// the same job on different material, and one shape is what lets a reader who
// knows either one read the other.
