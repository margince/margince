// The two places an agent-loop scenario has more than one thing to say, and the
// spellings that let it say them.
//
// THE WINDOW. A scenario about which step a turn takes is a scenario about the
// surface the turn chose from. Spelling two tools by hand is the right fixture
// when the point is the choice BETWEEN those two — but the product offers the
// workspace's whole governed surface, and a choice made among two neighbours is
// not the choice made among thirty. So `tools` also takes the word `catalog`,
// which resolves to the registry the composition actually builds. Nothing is
// copied: a tool added, renamed or withdrawn reaches these scenarios the same
// commit it reaches the surface, which is what a hand-spelled catalog could
// never promise.
//
// THE STEP. `answer` is a step name, and for most scenarios that is the whole
// claim: the turn had to read before it wrote, and which arguments it read with
// is the model's business. A scenario that DOES care — the goal names a record
// the grounding identifies, so a call omitting it is a call that guessed — needs
// somewhere to put that, and pinning it inside the step name would make every
// other scenario carry an assertion it does not mean.
