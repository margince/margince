// This file is the overlay reconcile sweep's object-class policy: which
// HubSpot classes the poller sweeps, and — for each — whether a failure
// sweeping it must abort the whole connection sweep or is tolerated as a
// best-effort miss. Kept beside jobs_overlay.go's sweep loop (its only
// caller) but in its own file so that loop stays focused on orchestration.

// no generic engagements object, and each maps to its own activity kind
// (OVA-MAP-1).

// downscoped. A best-effort class (leads and the engagement classes, swept
// with no requested scope) never breaks the classes we can sync — but it still
// aborts on a CONNECTION-WIDE condition: budget exhaustion (continuing to spend
// against an exhausted volume budget is pointless) or ErrConnectionGone (a disconnect
// racing the sweep — the connection no longer exists, so the on-demand
// reconciler must see this to collapse it to ErrModeNotOverlay, and the poller
// must not reset backoff on a dead connection). Every per-OBJECT failure — a
// missing scope (403), an absent object (404), or a validation 400 on an
// engagement endpoint this portal shapes differently — is skipped for a
// best-effort class, because these were swept without validation against every
// portal shape and a scope-backed outage would already have aborted earlier in
// the loop (the scope-backed classes are swept first).
