// Erasure and subject-access, over the messages nobody has decided yet.
//
// A staged approval holds a whole composed message — an addressee, a subject
// line, a body — before any scheduled row or activity exists. Every other
// outbound scrub keys off the activity a message became, so until now nothing
// reached it: a subject could exercise Art. 17 tonight and have that draft
// released by a colleague in the morning, from a system that had just certified
// their data destroyed.
//
// The assertion that matters is not that the payload is blank. It is that the
// card cannot be acted on afterwards — a blanked proposal still sitting in an
// inbox is one somebody can approve, and approving it runs its effect against
// an empty payload.
