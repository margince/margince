// The certification case for cold_start/field_extract.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from companyFactsRequest, the same builder extractFields calls, and the
// reply is judged by gateEvidence, the same no-guess gate extractFields applies.
// A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green
// through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the fields that must survive the gate, with
// the values they must carry. It is a subset claim, never an inventory — a real
// page carries more facts than a scenario cares to pin, and demanding
// exhaustiveness would fail a read for being richer than its author imagined.
// The one thing this site can be wrong about is a fact: it either grounds the
// one the scenario named, or it grounds something else, or it grounds nothing.
