// docs/reference/mcp-info.json is the served MCP surface, as a client receives
// it — the two catalogs a client fetches before it may do anything, captured
// from the real hosted handler rather than re-rendered from the registry.
//
// It exists because the surface's SIZE and its CONTENT are both review
// questions and neither was visible in a diff. A tool's description is prose in
// a Go file; what a client actually holds is that prose plus a JSON schema plus
// the governance clause the transport appends, and the difference between those
// two things is where a catalog quietly doubles. Publishing the served bytes
// means a change that adds 4 KB to every client's session shows up as 4 KB in
// the pull request that adds it.
//
// It is the ALL-SCOPE listing, deliberately, and the file says so. tools/list
// is scope-filtered per caller, so there is no single "the" catalog — a
// read-scoped passport is served a much shorter one. The complete surface is
// the only rendering that is stable to review against and the only one that is
// the worst case, which is the same reason the listing budget is measured
// against it.
