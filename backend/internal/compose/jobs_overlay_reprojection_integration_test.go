// The sweep's re-projection phase, proved against a real Postgres: a mirror
// row an OLDER mapping declaration projected is re-fetched, a row already at
// today's declaration is left alone, and once the re-fetch has landed the row
// leaves the stale set for good. Without this phase nothing clears a stale
// projection — the sweep is watermark-driven, and a record the incumbent has
// not touched is never re-read — so the flip preflight's block on those rows
// would be permanent rather than temporary.
//
// The assertions are on the ENQUEUED job, not on a completed re-fetch: what
// the job then does is overlay_refetch's own tested behaviour, and asserting
// it here would make an unrelated change to that worker fail this suite for
// the wrong reason. The suite runs the worker only where the point is precisely
// that the two halves fit together: a re-fetch that lands and converges the
// row, and one that can never land and records why.
