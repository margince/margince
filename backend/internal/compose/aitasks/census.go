// Package aitasks is the census of this build's AI invocation sites: which
// task each one serves, what the contract calls it, and how it invokes the
// model.
//
// It deliberately claims nothing about HOW a site works. A task is not one
// prompt (rate_extract has two, cold_start four), a site's answer schema may
// be built per call, and an agent loop has no single buildable request at all
// — so an interface promising build-then-parse would force honest
// implementations into adapters that lie. The shared invariant is only that a
// registered shipped site exists, the contract declares it, and it can be
// located.
//
// Registration is composition-time, like automation's RegisterWorkflow: a
// process role that builds no model path registers nothing, and a test builds
// its own registry rather than mutating a global.
