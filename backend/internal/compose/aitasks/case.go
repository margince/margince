	// production validator closes over the fixture here — the requested row id,
	// the snippet index, the page menu — so the cert lane runs the SAME

	// for when the evidence grounds nothing ("OMIT any field the passages do not
	// ground — never guess"). Grading it as a wrong answer scores obedience as
	// error, and a corpus cannot then hold a scenario whose right answer is
	// silence.

	// A site whose production path treats an empty result as an ERROR — the
