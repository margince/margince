// layer: the scenario corpus format, the §5 verdict math, and the on-disk
// record format. It has no side effects beyond the file I/O its functions
// are named for (LoadCorpus, WriteRecord/LoadRecords) — no time.Now, no
// network, no database — so a certification run is reproducible from a
// corpus, a set of RunResults, and a clock reading the CALLER supplies. The
// runner that drives real model calls lives in this package too, but as its
// own file: this file and its siblings (score.go, record.go) stay callable
