// once per LOGICAL call — one batch carrying every rung that call
// walked, with exactly one attempt in the batch marked IsTerminal — and
// it does so synchronously before Router.Complete returns, so the
// runner can always read this call's own outcome back immediately via
// lastTerminal rather than re-deriving it from Router.Complete's
// return values. Batches (not a flattened attempt list) is what makes
// "this run's own terminal attempt" a one-line lookup instead of a scan
