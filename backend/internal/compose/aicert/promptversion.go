// PromptVersion is a task's certification stamp: a digest of the exact SCENARIOS
// a run was scored against, and of the REQUESTS this build's own code builds
// from them — the candidate's and the grader's alike.
//
// It is all three because a record claims to describe what ships, and any one of
// them moving breaks that claim.
//
// The scenario is digested WHOLE. The rubric is read to the grader, the expected
// answer decides what "right" means, and the caps and bands decide what passes —
// each of them changes what a score means, and none of them reaches a request.
//
// The requests are digested because the corpus does not hold them: a scenario
// carries the data a site is GIVEN, and the site's own code turns that into the
// prompt the model sees. A stamp over the scenario alone would leave every
// prompt in the product free to change under a record still claiming to certify
// it — the failure a fixture corpus otherwise reintroduces.
//
// What is digested on the candidate's side is the FIRST request each case
// issues, built by driving the same Prepare/Run a paid run drives, so the stamp
// cannot be a second description of the request kept in sync by hand. The first
// request is the one a multi-call site builds before any reply exists, which is
// what makes it a pure function of the fixture and the code rather than of what
// a model said. Everything a call mints for itself is canonicalised away — the
// data boundary and the record ids a prompt identifies its data by — so the
// stamp moves when the wording moves and stays put when only one call's own
// identifiers do.
//
// The grader's request is digested beside it, and graderRequestDigest states
// what that reaches.
