// The shipped corpus's own self-test: no e2e_llm build tag, no network, no
// model call — LoadCorpus is a pure parse over the committed corpus/ tree
// (aicert.LoadCorpus's own doc: "no time.Now, no network, no database").
// The obligation follows the contract's status, in both directions: a
// shipped SITE without a scenario has nothing to certify, and a planned task
// WITH one scores a prompt that does not ship — which reads as coverage it has
// not earned. Both are derived from ai-tasks.yaml rather than a maintained
// list, the same way arch_test.go's fitness tests derive their obligations
// from the tree.
//
// The unit is the site, not the task, because a task is not one prompt: rate
// extraction has two sites, cold start four, and voice building three. A
// per-task obligation let one scenario stand for all of a task's sites, so a
// site could ship with its prompt never once scored while the corpus reported
// the task covered.
