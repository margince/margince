// The judge's call-and-retry drive and the per-run caps gate — what
// runner.go's certifyTask needs beyond the prepared case itself to turn one
// scored answer into one RunResult, split out of runner.go to keep that file
// to the orchestration loop.
//
// The candidate's request is NOT built here, and no longer anywhere in this
// package: each site's own case issues the request its production code
// issues. A scenario's caps.max_tokens therefore grades the answer the model
// gave (checkCaps below); the ceiling the model was handed is the shipped
// builder's, which is the whole point of certifying it.
//
// The judge's own prompt and verdict parse are NOT here either: cert_judge is
// a registered invocation site, and a site's prompt is built in compose
// (compose.JudgeRequest / compose.ParseJudgeVerdict) so the census can
// certify it like every other.
