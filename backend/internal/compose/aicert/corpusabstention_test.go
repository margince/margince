// The shipped corpus's third self-test, for the scenarios whose right answer is
// silence.
//
// Preparation proves a scenario is runnable; it says nothing about whether the
// scenario can tell a right answer from a wrong one. That gap is worst here. A
// scenario asserting an abstention passes when the model produces nothing, and
// "produced nothing" is what a fabricating model looks like too once a gate has
// refused everything it claimed — so an abstention scenario that graded both the
// same would pass whatever the model did, which is worse than no scenario at
// all: it would report a fabrication-rate floor that was never measured.
//
// So each of these scenarios is run twice against the case its site binds: once
// with the answer it says is correct, and once with the fabrication it exists to
// catch. The first must reach the outcome the scenario expects and the second
// must not. The replies are canned rather than generated — what is under test is
// the scenario's discrimination, not a model's behaviour.
