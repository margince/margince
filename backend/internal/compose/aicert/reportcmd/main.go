// Command reportcmd prints the AI certification readiness report — one row per
// shipped invocation site, saying whether a record covers it, whether that
// record still describes what this build sends, and on which
// (provider, model, env) it was measured. It reads three trees: the census of
// sites this build ships, the corpus those sites are scored against, and the
// committed records aicert.LoadRecords reads back
// (backend/internal/compose/aicert/records/ by default).
//
// It is a go-run-only developer tool, not a shipped process role:
// `make e2e-ai-report` invokes it directly with `go run`, so it never gets a
// cmd/<role> entry of its own. It always exits 0 — the certification lane is
// paid and manual, and a report that failed a build would make every prompt
// edit wait on a paid run.
