// The deep read's cross-page fold for the page-parallel lane: facts
// dedupe on category+field+value key, people on the normalized name,
// entities union.
// With the binary citation gate there is no model confidence to break
// ties — page-kind specificity does (an Impressum's phone beats a
// homepage mention), then first-seen, and page order is deterministic,
// so the merge is too.

// A fact's identity within one read is the identity the DB and the
// selection API already use: category + field + value key (factKey). Two
// findings that share a NAME but not a field are two facts — a company
// legitimately appears as both a partner and a named customer, and
// collapsing them would silently drop one of its own claims.
//
// Consumers that select by value key alone (the onboarding wizard's
// selected_fact_keys) therefore have to fold the duplicates themselves; a
// set of keys is what they send, and one key selects every fact carrying
// it.

// factBands curate a read down to what a human will actually confirm.
//
// Truncating the merged list instead would be quietly wrong: facts arrive
// in crawl-commit order, the probes (imprint, about, contact) and the
// partner wall commit first, and the offering pages commit last — so a
// plain head-of-list cut keeps thirty-five integration partners and
// twenty office cities while dropping what the company sells, which is
// the one thing company context exists to record.
//
// So the budget is split by what each kind of fact is worth to a CRM,
// richest band first, and a band that cannot fill its share lends the
// remainder to the next. Within a band the merge's own order survives, so
// the result stays deterministic.
//
// Named offerings band separately from capabilities on purpose. A leaf
// page states its bullets as capabilities — "zero-downtime deployment
// strategies", "segregation of duties within deployment pipelines" — and
// there are always more of those than a company has things to sell. Share
// one band and the bullets crowd out the catalog.
