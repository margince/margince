// The race itself, against real Postgres.
//
// The unit lane proves the tool hands the store the version the gate read. What
// it cannot prove is that the store then REFUSES on it: the version compare
// lives in Patch.ApplyGuarded, inside the transaction deals.Store.AdvanceDeal
// opens, and only a database answers that.
//
// So everything here is real except the timing: the deal, the pipeline, both
// writes, the gate, the tier resolver and the version compare. The provider is
// wrapped only to make the racing close land at the one instant that reproduces
// the defect — inside the window between the gate's read and the write it
// admits. A concurrent close is otherwise a coin toss, and a test that
// reproduces a race one run in fifty is a test that reports green.
//
// The authority seam is stubbed (adminSeat) because this is not about who the
// agent is; the gate's own suite covers that, and a real seat lookup would make
// this file fail for reasons that are not the race.
