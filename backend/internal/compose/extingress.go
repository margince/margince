//
// The shape to hold onto is that this adapter converts and REFUSES, and writes

// idempotent upsert, the counterparty ladder, the raw evidence, the audit row
// and the outbox event in one transaction — so there is no second write shape
// here to keep in step with the first. What this file owns is the authority the
// write runs under, the provenance it carries, and the bounds a remote party is
// held to before any of it opens a transaction.
