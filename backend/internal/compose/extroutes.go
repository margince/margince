// The extension REST surface. An extension's contract fragment declares
// operations under /v1/ext/<unit>/…; this is where those declarations become
// mounted routes.
//
// They are NOT in ServerInterface, and cannot be: crmcontracts is generated
// from the BASE contract, which is installation-independent by design, while an
// extension operation exists only in the merged one. So the compile-error
// guarantee core routes have — `var _ crmcontracts.ServerInterface = Server{}`
// in server.go, which makes a declared operation with no handler a build
// failure — is unavailable here. extparity_test.go is the runtime equivalent,
// and it has to fail in BOTH directions: a declared verb with no registration
// is a documented route answering 404, and a registration nothing declares is
// a reachable endpoint no contract, client or manifest knows about.
//
// The routes mount on the UNIT'S OWN router — a dedicated *http.ServeMux — and
// that router is spliced into the /v1 chain INSIDE the session middleware
// (routes.go). Mounting them on the operational mux instead would be a
// security defect rather than a style choice: ServeMux prefers the longest
// matching pattern, so a "/v1/ext/" registration there would win over the
// "/v1/" entry that carries authH.Middleware, and every extension route would
// serve without a session or a workspace.

//   - declared, mounted, unimplemented — a contract-only governed request
//     (fixtures/extensions/crm-hello's hello_ping is exactly this), legitimate
//     and answered 501;
//   - declared and missing — the defect the sweep exists to catch.
//
// Collapsing the first two is what let a published route reach the registry for
// a verb nothing registered, and answer an opaque logged 500.

// MountExtensionRoutes mounts one route per declared extension operation onto
// mux and reports the patterns it registered.
//
// The signature takes VERBS, not []extension.Extension as the slice plan
// sketched. After the narrowing there is nothing in an extension.Extension a
// route could be derived from: a Tool is {Name, Handle}, and the route, the
// method and the operation id live in the contract. Passing the declarations
// this mounts from is the difference between a seam whose inputs are visible
// and one that reads a package variable.
//
// served names the verbs a composed unit actually registered a handler for,
// keyed by (unit, tool) — compose's composedServedVerbs at the call site, built
// on the same verbKey the behavior-to-contract join uses. A declared verb
// outside it is still MOUNTED — the contract publishes the route either way,
// and a 404 would contradict the document a client generated its call from —
// but it answers a named 501 instead of reaching a registry that has never
// heard of it.
//
// The PAIR, never the bare verb: an `x-mcp-tool` value is a string a unit
// writes into its own contract fragment, so a bare-verb key let unit B declare
// a contract-only operation naming unit A's served verb and inherit A's
// handler — B's published route executing A's tier, scope, RBAC object and
// schemas. See composedServedVerbs.
//
// Returned routes are the registration side of the parity pair. They are
// returned rather than recorded in a package variable because a ServeMux cannot

// ever check the two directions against each other. See extparity_test.go for
