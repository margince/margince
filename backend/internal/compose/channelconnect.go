// The /channel-connections wiring (telegram-oa design v2 §4): the workspace-level
// Telegram bot binding. Ingress PULLS, so this surface needs nothing about where
// this installation can be reached — only the vault that seals the bot token,
// which WithKeyvault hands to the transport composed here.
//
// WithChannelSurface must therefore be applied BEFORE WithKeyvault, the same
// ordering contract WithOverlayBackfillLimit states, and cmd/api holds it.

// deployment configuration at all: connecting a bot needs a token and a vault,
// and a poll dials out, so there is nothing about this installation's own address
// for an operator to get wrong.

// The vault arrives later, through WithKeyvault — until then the read surface
// lists what is bound and every mutating path refuses by name
// (`channel_credentials_not_configured`) rather than sealing a token nothing
// could unseal.
