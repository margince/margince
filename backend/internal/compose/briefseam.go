//
// briefs is a compose subpackage and agents is a module, so the edge between
// them is wired here like every other cross-module edge (ADR-0054 §9). What
// crosses is one function: the acting human's latest PERSISTED run. The
// refresh, and the per-item marks, are not offered — they are how a person
// notices what an agent did.
