// The org-name promotion sweep (PO-F-2a, ADR-0072/A118 phase 3): the follow-on
// to the signature-enrich pass, and the only consumer of the `org_name`
// evidence that pass collects.
//
// A captured organization is named from its mail domain and marked provisional.
// This sweep replaces that name with the one the company's own people sign
// with, but only when a second independent source agrees — the site dossier or
// a second employee. A lone signature is not overruled and not obeyed either:
// it becomes a 🟡 proposal, and a human decides.
//
// No model call, no network: everything it weighs is already in the database,
// so it runs in the same River job as the enrich pass that produced the
// evidence rather than paying for a schedule of its own.
