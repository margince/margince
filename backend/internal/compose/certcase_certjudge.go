// The certification case for cert_judge/judge — the grader every other site's
// score comes from, which is why it is graded itself: an unmeasured grader makes
// every record it signs a claim about a model nobody checked.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: Run issues
// JudgeRequest and Evaluate reads the answer with ParseJudgeVerdict, the two the
// harness's own judge call runs (judgeScore in compose/aicert calls the same two
// symbols, not copies of them). Those two moved out of the harness for this
// case: aicert imports compose, so a builder living there could never be reached
// by a case bound here.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is a score BAND, not a score: the range a
// competent grader must place this candidate output in. An exact number is one
// grader's units — no two models put the same integer on the same answer — but
// the band is the only thing the harness ever asks of a score: Verdict compares
// the median against certified_min and the worst run against floor, and never
// reads the number for anything else. So the band certifies exactly the property
// the product acts on, and a scenario supplying a plainly good or plainly bad
// output can defend it.
//
// The verdict's reason is deliberately ungraded. judgeScore keeps the score and
// discards the reason, so a case that failed a run over its wording would refuse
// answers production uses without complaint.
//
// Run issues ONE call, where judgeScore retries once. The retry asks the same
// question again — same rubric, same input, same output, under this call's own
// freshly minted boundary — as the harness's tolerance for a grader that fumbled
// its JSON, and its double-failure fallback is a score of 0 that no model
// actually said. Certifying that would report a second attempt at the same
// question as if it were the grader's answer, and hide an unusable reply inside
// a number the bands would read as a terrible one. The seam already has the
// honest word for it: OutcomeInvalid.
