//
// There were two answers to "prepare me for this meeting": a person read eight
// cited sections, and an agent got a separate context walk with its open tasks
// pulled forward. Both were individually reasonable, which is exactly why the
// drift went unnoticed — nobody put the two answers side by side.
//
// The mapping below is the whole crossing, so it is where the two can silently
// stop agreeing again: a section dropped, a citation flattened, a judgment
// served as a fact.
