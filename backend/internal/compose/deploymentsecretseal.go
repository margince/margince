// Moving a deployment-wide credential out of the process environment and into
// the key vault, once, without asking the operator to do anything.
//
// Two credentials take this path: the outbound-relay password and the license
// token. An installation that declares either one today keeps working and needs
// no action — the value is sealed on the next boot and the declaration becomes
// how the credential ARRIVED rather than where it lives. Once the boot log says
// it is sealed, the operator may delete the declaration: the whole `license:`
// block, or the `password:` line under `email.smtp`. Deleting only what it
// points AT is not the same thing and fails the boot in deployconfig — a named
// source that yields nothing has always been an error there, not an absence.
// Nothing here can delete it for them: the process cannot edit its own
// deployment.
//
// The DECLARATION outranks the sealed copy, which is the opposite of the order
// the BYOK provider keys take, and the difference is not an oversight. A
// provider key has a human write path — the routing surface — so the vault has
// to win or an admin's change would lose to a stale variable. These two have no
// write path at all: no seeded role holds update on either entry, so the sealed
// copy can only ever be a mirror of what the deployment declared. Reading the
// declaration first is therefore what keeps in-place rotation working, and
// re-sealing when it changes is what keeps the mirror honest.
