// The brief without a model.
//
// Every sentence cites the record it came from, exactly as a model-written one
// would, so the card renders and behaves identically whichever wrote it. That
// is the point of the floor: a workspace with no model lane gets a plainer
// brief, not a blank card where the brief should be, and `generated_by` says
// which it is rather than passing one off as the other.
