// One hop means one edge from the account. A contact's other employers, a

// fold in people.StrengthForPeople, which joins activity and activity_link per
// contact, and every node this package then builds. Both used to grow with the
// account.
//
// It does NOT bound the count: the headcount rides the same statement (see
// readEmployment for why it must), and counting means reading one account's

// count reads as the whole neighbourhood — and one index range scan per account
