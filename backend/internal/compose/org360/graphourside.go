// edge names the organization the caller is already reading and a colleague
// from the workspace roster, so it needs neither grant of its own — it is held
// to the same pair because a partial answer to "who here is connected" is a
// misleading one.
//
// Neither gate is inferred from whether another group reported itself omitted:
// a group list reordered for any reason must not be able to turn a gated read

// readInContactWith reads which colleagues have REAL recorded contact with the
// account's people, and with whom.
//
// It reads the interaction projection (CG-DDL-1), which is folded from the
// participant rows capture stamps — who was actually IN each conversation.
//
// What it replaced is worth stating, because the failure was invisible. This
// used to match `a.captured_by = 'human:' || u.id::text` on the activity row.
// Connector-captured mail is stamped `connector:gmail`, so the overwhelming
// majority of a real workspace's timeline matched nothing and this group came
// back empty — on precisely the accounts with the most correspondence. A rep
// opening a busy account saw "nobody here has been in touch", and there was no
// error anywhere to suggest otherwise.
//
// Real contact still means a recorded exchange rather than an intention: a
// task or a note is not an interaction at all. Every participant role does
// count, cc included (ADR-0078) — in an account team the colleague permanently
// in copy is frequently the one who knows the customer. Copy-only traffic is
// one-directional, so the reciprocity term ranks that colleague below anyone
// in a two-way thread instead of a role filter removing them.
//
// On gating: the contacts passed in are the ones the card has already PLACED,
// which means they have already passed the person row-scope gate — and capture
// privacy with it, so an unpromoted contact cannot appear here. The old query
// additionally carried the activity scope clause; it is subsumed rather than
// dropped. An activity's visibility derives from its links, so an activity
// linked to a person the caller can see is one the caller can read under the
// same any-link rule the timeline uses. There is no edge here whose underlying
// activity the caller could not open.
//
// The cap picks distinct USERS — most recent contact first — and the
// distinct-user total rides the SAME statement as the rows. Two statements
// would each take their own snapshot, so a concurrent interaction between them
// could make dropped_count NEGATIVE, a response violating the contract's own
// `minimum: 0`.
