// Who on our side can actually reach each contact.
//
// The V2 company page has to answer this per CONTACT rather than as a
// contact × every-colleague matrix. A forty-person sales team makes the matrix
// unreadable, and the reader's question is never "show me all the pairs" — it is
// "who should make this call". So each contact carries the few colleagues worth
// naming and a count of the rest.
//
// TWO STATES THAT LOOK ALIKE AND ARE NOT. A contact nobody has ever exchanged a
// message with is UNTRIED. A contact somebody wrote to repeatedly with no reply
// scores COLD. Rendering them the same tells a rep an account is unreachable
// when in fact nobody has tried, which is the opposite instruction.
//
// The colleagues named here are live members only, by the same pair the roster
// lists by (liveMemberWhere): recommending an intro from someone who left is
// advice that cannot be taken. Their historical messages still count on the
// timeline — the person is gone, what happened is not.

// when, through the people section, having been refused it everywhere else.
//
// A caller who may not ask gets NO routes rather than an empty set: an empty
// set is an answer ("nobody can reach them"), and answering that to someone who
// was not allowed to ask is the disclosure inverted. The wire field is optional
// precisely so it can be absent.
