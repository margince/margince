// Suggestion dismissals: the rep saying "not this, not now".
//
// Per user, because advice one rep has judged is not advice their colleague
// has seen. Keyed on the suggestion's evidence fingerprint, so it stays gone
// while the situation holds and re-arms by itself when the evidence changes.
//
// A row is written ONLY for a fingerprint the rules currently produce for this
// account and this caller. That is what bounds the table: one row per suggestion
// a human actually clicked, so it grows with use rather than with whatever a
// client chooses to send. No retention cap is needed, and no judgment is ever
// deleted to make room for another.
//
// The two obvious alternatives are both wrong. Accepting any
// well-formed fingerprint makes this an authenticated write sink — every distinct
// value is a row nothing will ever collect. Capping the stored count instead
// silently deletes the earliest judgments on an account with more suggestions
// than the cap, so a rep working through it has advice they already dismissed
// come back. Verifying on write is the only version with neither failure.
//
// suggestion_dismissal is view state, not a record fact: written on a click,
// readable by nobody but its own user, actionable by no consumer. It carries
// no audit row and no outbox event — the same ruling as user_record_view.
