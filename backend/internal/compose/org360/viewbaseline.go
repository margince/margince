// The visit baseline: the per-user "I have seen this" mark, and the delta
// the company view reports against it.
//
// The mark moves forward ONLY through Acknowledge. A GET that advanced it
// as a side effect would destroy the answer the caller opened the page to
// read, and would make a prefetch indistinguishable from a visit.
//
// user_record_view is view state, not a record fact: it is written on
// every visit, no other user may read it, and no consumer can act on it.
// It therefore carries no audit row and no outbox event — the saved-view
// ruling, recorded against this package in backend/tableownership_test.go.

// prevent. `GREATEST` is the whole correctness argument: a copy that lost it
// would rewind a baseline on a late-arriving ack from a slow tab, consuming an
// unread marker nobody consumed. Two writers of one write shape signal nothing
// while they agree, and they agree right up until one of them is edited.
//
// What the callers keep is the part that legitimately differs: their own
// visibility gate. org360 asks `EnsureVisible`, person360 asks
// `EnsureVisibleLive`, because an anonymized person keeps their owner_id and
// the plain probe would still admit them. That difference is a ruling per
// record type; the upsert is not.

// write have to be the same transaction, or a record that stopped being visible
// between them would still get a baseline.
