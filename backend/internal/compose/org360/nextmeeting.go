// The next meeting with this account, and who is in it.
//
// It is a FACT and it sits with the other facts, not with the suggestions: a
// meeting is on the calendar or it is not. The page's `meeting_ahead` moment
// says a meeting is coming and is worth preparing for; this says which one and
// with whom, so the "Prepare" action has something to prefill from.
//
// The section is ABSENT for two opposite reasons, and `sections_omitted` is the
// only thing that separates them: named there, the caller has no activity grant;
// not named, the grant is held and nothing is scheduled. "No meeting booked" is
// a fact a rep acts on; "you cannot see the calendar" is not the same statement,
// and a client that reads the missing field alone tells someone with no calendar
// access to book a meeting that already exists.
//
// The field cannot carry an explicit null to make this easier: the generated
// wire type is an omitempty pointer, so nil and absent are the same bytes. The
// omission list is the mechanism, which is also the convention every other
// section on this payload already follows.
