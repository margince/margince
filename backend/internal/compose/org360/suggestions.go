// The next-step suggestions: what this account looks like it needs, computed
// from its own records.
//
// NO MODEL. Every rule here is a comparison a rep could make themselves, and
// each suggestion carries the rule in the words they read — so they can
// disagree with the REASON rather than with a verdict they cannot inspect.
// A model could phrase these more warmly; it could not make them checkable,
// and checkable is what makes advice actionable.
//
// Each rule runs under the same row-scope predicates as the section it concerns,
// and only when the caller holds the grant that section rides — so a suggestion
// can only ever point at records they can open, and a grant they lack produces
// silence rather than advice inferred from the gap. What the rules read, and why
// they do not read the truncated section pages, is suggestionreads.go.
//
// Nothing is staged and nothing is sent. A suggestion is a sentence and its
// evidence; what to DO about it stays the rep's move through the same endpoints
// they would have used anyway.
