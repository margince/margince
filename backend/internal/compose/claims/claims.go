// It is one implementation on purpose. Three copies of a grounding rule is
// three chances for one of them to be lenient, and a lenient one renders a
// sentence nobody can check as though it had been checked. The rule is the
// product's whole answer to "how do I know this is true", so it has exactly one

// What lives here is the part that does not depend on WHICH surface is asking:
// the claim natures, the citation shape, and the decision to keep or drop a
// sentence given the records the assembler actually supplied. Building that
// supplied set is each surface's own job — the brief knows about deals and
// tasks, the dossier about profile fields and facts — and neither knows about
// the other's inputs.
