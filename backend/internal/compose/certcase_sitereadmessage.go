// The certification case for cold_start/sitereadmessage — the conversation an
// administrator has with Margince about the dossier its crawl just read.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from companyReadAnswerRequest and the reply is judged by the gate
// newCompanyReadGate builds, both of which the transport uses for the same turn.
// A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green
// through the change that breaks the original.
//
// This site is MULTI-TURN, and the kind names the conversation rather than the
// number of calls: the model is stateless, so the whole prior conversation is
// replayed as messages of the ONE request this site sends. The case replays
// exactly the turns the transport would have replayed, through
// companyReadConversation — the same mapping, which is also the bound on how
// many turns a call may carry.
//
// What makes this site worth certifying separately from the other onboarding
// conversations is its gate. The other acts may not propose company changes at
// all; this one may, and only the ones the administrator actually asked for.
// That authorization is derived from what the human said — this message and the
// conversation behind it — so the SAME reply is a correct correction in one
// conversation and a confused-deputy action in the next: a change nobody asked
// for arrives at the confirm-first queue indistinguishable from one they did,
// which is where an approval stops being a decision. The dossier is crawled web
// text and can argue for a change in as many words; the gate, not the prompt, is
// what refuses it. So the case's gate is built from the fixture it sent, and
// never from anything else.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is the company conversations' shared claim —
// the register the reply answers in and the changes it proposes — read by
// readCompanyConversationExpectation.
