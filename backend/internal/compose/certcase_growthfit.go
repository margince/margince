// The certification case for growth_fit.
//
// It certifies the shipped path: the request is built by orgdossier's own
// writer and the reply is read by orgdossier's own parser and grounding
// filter. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays
// green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is two things, because a growth fit is two
// claims. First the records a defensible assessment has to be grounded in —
// not the wording, since the prose is a judgment and pinning its sentences
// would fail a good assessment for choosing different words. Second the band
// itself, as a set of ACCEPTABLE bands rather than one: whether a company is a
// strong or a moderate fit is a judgment two careful readers can differ on,
// while calling a clear misfit strong is a failure at the only thing this
// surface is for.
//
// The fixture names its records by LABEL. Prepare mints the ids, so an id in
// the reply is an id the model was handed rather than one the corpus author
// could have written into the expected answer.
