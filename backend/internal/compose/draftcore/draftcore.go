// Package draftcore holds what must not differ between drafting surfaces.
//
// There are three: the reply to an activity, the person composer, and
// account-started outbound. They differ in what a draft is grounded IN — an
// activity, a Person360, an Organization360 — and that difference is real and
// stays with each surface. What they share is the machinery around generation,
// and every time a copy of it drifted, a defect shipped on one surface and not
// the others.
//
// This package owns the correct-and-retry loop, which is the piece with the
// most judgement in it. The surface supplies two closures — write once, read
// what came back — and gets back the draft to serve. It holds no prompt text,
// no schema and no grounding: those are per-surface by design, and a package
// that owned them would be a fourth surface pretending to be a library.
//
// It lives in the composition layer because its consumers are compose
// subpackages that may not import each other.

// Observer is told what the loop decided, so a surface keeps the operational

// TextOf reads the two channels of a draft a check has to judge.
//
// Both, because they fail differently and only one used to be read. The BODY is
// what the recipient sees. The REASONING labels are what the product tells the
// rep it wrote from, and a rep reads a chip less critically than the sentence
// they are about to send — so a wrong chip is the worse of the two. An invented
// "introduction by Romina Medici" reached one on a real thread while the body
// beside it was correct.
//
// The subject is deliberately absent: it is one line with its own rules, and
// folding it in would let a phrase banned in prose hide there.
type TextOf[D any] func(D) (body string, reasoning []string)

// SubjectOf reads a draft's subject line and whether a real inbound thread
// earns it a reply prefix. Separate from TextOf because a subject fails
// differently — its worst failure is a CLAIM ("Re:" says a thread exists)
// rather than a phrase — and because a surface with no subject supplies none.
type SubjectOf[D any] func(D) (subject string, threaded bool)

// CorrectOnce writes a draft, checks it against the correspondence it was
// written into, and gives the model exactly one chance to fix what it got wrong.
//
// One retry, because the alternatives are both worse. Zero leaves a defect the
// product knows about in text a human is about to send. Two or more is a model
// that will not comply, paid for twice more, while a deterministic floor sits
// underneath that was always going to be the answer.
//
// The correction names the exact phrase back to the model, which is the thing a
// prompt sentence cannot do — and the reason this loop exists at all is that
// three separate prompt rules lost to model reflexes before it did.
//
// When the retry does not clear the findings, the attempt carrying FEWER of them
// is served. A second attempt is not automatically better, and the count is the
// only evidence available without asking a model to judge its own output.
// Findings is everything the phrasing rules say is wrong with one draft.
//
// Exported because CorrectOnce is not the only pass that has to ask. The voice
// floor runs AFTER this loop and may substitute a retried draft, so it needs
// the same answer to know whether the substitution regressed anything — and a
// second spelling of "what is wrong with a draft" would drift from this one
// until the two disagreed about a phrase in front of a user.
