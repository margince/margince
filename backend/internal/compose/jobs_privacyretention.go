// River wiring for the GDPR retention pass (data-model §3.4, ADR-0011): a
// dispatcher over EVERY workspace and a worker that evaluates one. It
// registers itself — workers and periodic schedule together — so jobs.go,
// which owns the runner's assembly, grows one line as this surface does.

// a tenant with a real backlog mid-record on every attempt until the row
// discards, leaving a permanently failing job row on the one obligation whose
