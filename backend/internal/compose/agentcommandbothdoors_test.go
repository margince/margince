// One operation, two doors, one command.
//
// For an operation a client can reach BOTH ways — the REST route and the tool
// verb its `x-mcp-tool` names — the two doors must resolve to the same governed
// call: the same record, the same version to pin, the same sentence a human
// reads. That is the whole claim of the command seam (modules/agents/command.go)
// and the only claim no single-door test can make, because each door is
// perfectly self-consistent while describing a different act.
//
// The fixtures are written PER DOOR, from each door's own published contract:
// the REST request from the route and requestBody crm.yaml declares, the tool
// arguments from the verb's own InputSchema. Deriving one from the other — call
// a decoder, feed its output to the twin — would compare a decoder with itself
// and pass for any pair of doors that agreed on nothing.
//
// The enrich verb is why the SUMMARY is compared and not only the target. Its
// two operations are one verb at two depths against one organization, so a
// swapped depth is invisible in every field a door writes: the target is the
// same organization either way, and the line this door stages is its own
// path-derived one (restSummary), which still names the route the caller took.
// The resolver's sentence is the only place the erased command's depth surfaces
// at all — so comparing it is how a page read that will execute as a whole-site
// crawl is caught, and there is nothing else on this door to catch it with.
