// The entitlement surface: what the license grants, and how much of it is used.
//
// Composed here because the answer has two halves that live in different layers
// and must not import each other — the posture is platform's (resolved from the
// deployment file against the bundled validation module) and the seat count is
// identity's (rows in app_user). Neither half is a sensible home for the other,
// and the verdict that pairs them — whether the installation is over its limit —
// belongs where both are already in scope.
