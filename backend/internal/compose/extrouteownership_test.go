// TestOneUnitCannotInheritAnothersHandlerByNamingItsVerb is the route-ownership
// regression. The served set used to be keyed on the bare tool verb, and an
// `x-mcp-tool` value is just a string a unit writes into its own contract
// fragment — so unit beta could declare a CONTRACT-ONLY operation naming
// alpha's served verb, be marked implemented on the strength of alpha's
// handler, and have its own published route dispatch that handler. What
// executed then was alpha's registry spec — alpha's tier, scope, RBAC object
// and schemas — under beta's published operation.
//
// The two routes are distinct paths under distinct unit namespaces, so nothing
// else in the mounting objects: the duplicate-pattern refusal never fires, and
// the parity sweeps see two legitimately declared operations.
