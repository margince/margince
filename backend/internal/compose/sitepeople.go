// The deep read's person lane: a crawled team
// page spends its per-page category budget on PEOPLE — who the site
// itself publishes, and nothing more. The gate is stricter than the fact
// gate because this is the NEVER-8 boundary (thin, published-only): a
// person survives only when name AND role are verbatim on the page, and a
// published_email / linkedin_url is kept only when the page prints it
// verbatim — otherwise the contact detail is stripped while the person
// survives. Nothing is fabricated, nothing enriched from elsewhere.
// Contact pages keep their company category call and get NO people call:
// one call per page, and a contact page's deliberate content is the
// company's own contact identity, not a roster.
