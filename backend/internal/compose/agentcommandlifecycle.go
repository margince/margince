// stepping a project along its phase ladder, and moving a deal between stages.
// Each names its record in the route and its operands in the body, and each
// has a tool-door twin resolving the identical command
// (modules/agents/commandlifecycle.go).

// a body that is not JSON and for a body that is perfectly good JSON carrying a
// to_stage_id the UUID decoder refuses. Answering "not readable JSON" to the
// second sends the caller hunting a syntax error that is not there, while the
// real fault — a value they can see and fix — goes unnamed.
