// Writing signals from what the correspondence already says (SIG-F-3, the
// signals chapter's Producers section).
//
// The signal table has existed since migration 0047 with a card above it, and
// nothing in the product ever wrote a row — the only writer was the human-only
// POST /signals. So every account answered "no signal", including one whose own
// mail says the contract ended.
//
// This file is the deterministic half. `ghosted_thread` is a comparison rather
// than a judgment — the newest interaction is ours, nobody answered it, and the
// account is one worth chasing — so it needs no model and cannot be wrong about
// anything a reader cannot check for themselves.
//
// A signal is an OBSERVATION, so it is written directly under the write shape
// and attributed to this producer. What follows FROM one — a lifecycle change,
// a deal, a task — is a structural claim about the record and stages for a
// human. The line is not about confidence: a wrong signal is a card someone
// dismisses, a wrong structural write is a record someone has to find and undo.

// TRUE: a reply from a colleague at the same account answers us, and a rule
// that cannot see that reply calls an answered thread ghosted.
//
// An interaction reaching two accounts counts as the newest for BOTH, and that
// is the intended reading here — "we spoke last and nobody answered" is a fact
// each account holds on its own, and one message can be the last word on two
// relationships. The extractor next door refuses the same ambiguity, because
// what it files is one claim that must belong to exactly one account.
