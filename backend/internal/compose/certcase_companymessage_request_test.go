// What the onboarding company-message case SENDS, as against what it makes of
// the answer. The two halves are asked separately because they fail separately:
// a case that judges correctly while sending a prompt production does not send
// reports a number about a call that never happens, and every outcome test in
// the file beside this one would stay green through exactly that drift.

// running the shipped path beside it: the same fixture, answered by the same
// model text, must produce the same request and the same verdict in the
// administrator's real assistant as in the case. Anything the answer path
// derives between the fixture and the gate — the dossier index, the
// administrator's statements, the plan's direct field, the clicked option's
// grant — is caught here if the case derives it differently.
//
// The assistant's answer path reads no store, so a brain is the whole of what it
// needs: the certified turn runs against the same struct the transport calls.
