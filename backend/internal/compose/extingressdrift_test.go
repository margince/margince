// The published ingress record and the core's own capture envelope are two
// hand-written type sets describing one thing, and nothing compiles them
// together: pkg/extension is stdlib-only, so it cannot alias or embed the core's
// shapes, and the adapter that bridges them names each field by hand.
//
// So a field ADDED to the core envelope is silent here. It compiles, it lands
// through every other connector, and a unit simply cannot supply it — which is
// how the first version of this seam shipped with no Addresses at all, meaning
// the internal-colleague gate it described could never fire (an empty address
// set reads as "this connector could not enumerate the parties"). Nothing
// failed; the drop just never happened.
//
// This walk is the answer: every field of the core's envelope is either mirrored
// on the published surface, or waived HERE with the reason it is absent. A new
// field arrives as a failing test naming itself.
//
// It lives in COMPOSE rather than beside the published types, and rather than
// in the root fitness package. pkg/extension may import nothing under internal,
// in test files and external test files alike, so it cannot see the envelope;
// and the root package is not permitted to depend on a module (go-arch-lint),
// so it cannot see capture's activity shape. Compose depends on both already —
// it is where the conversion under test lives.
