// An overlay-mode installation serves its reads from a mirror of the
// customer's incumbent CRM, and every contract field that mirror cannot fill
// is a blank a user sees. The blank is not the defect — an undecided blank
// is. This gate asks the contract what fields exist and demands the overlay
// registry have an answer for each, so a field added to the core model
// cannot pass unnoticed into a surface that silently drops it.
//
// Scope is the ARMED entities only. The registry declares the rest as
// unarmed entities carrying their own reason, and this run names them, so
// what is still undecided stays visible in code rather than in a backlog
// note.
