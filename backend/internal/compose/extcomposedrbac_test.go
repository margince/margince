// The SECRETS operations' grant, enforced — R1.
//
// extrbacenforce_test.go proves the mechanism over a note-shaped fixture: read
// and create, one object, refused on both transports. That mechanism was already
// sound when the UAT re-run found R1. The defect was that notes's three
// SECRETS operations declared no object at all, so the mechanism had nothing to
// enforce and any authenticated seat — read-only included — could replace the
// installation's signing key on either transport, after which every signature it
// produced was made with the attacker's key.
//
// The fix has two halves and they are tested in two places, because neither
// place can see the other:
//
//   - the DECLARATION rule, in pkg/extension: Verb.Validate now refuses a
//     mutating operation that names no RBAC object, at generation and at boot.
//     That is the half that closes the class for every future unit.
//   - the BEHAVIOUR, here: the declared pair notes now carries is actually
//     refused for a read-only seat, on the agent path AND on the mounted route.
//
// A note on what this file does NOT do: it does not read ComposedVerbs(). That
// set is a boot binding written by RegisterExtensions at a role main, so it is
// empty in this lane, and a test that looked there would SKIP — a vacuous green
// over exactly the defect it exists for.
