// The certification case for voice_build/eval_draft — the held-out drafting a
// voice build grades its own candidate on before the profile is allowed to
// write anything for a human.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the request
// comes from voiceEvalDraftRequest, the same builder the evaluation loop calls,
// and the reply is read by readVoiceEvalDraft, the evaluation's own reading of a
// draft. A case that rebuilt either would measure a copy, and a copy stays green
// through the change that breaks the original.
//
// ONE call of this site is one held-out sample at one REPEAT, and the repeat is
// in the fixture because it is in the prompt: the evaluation asks the same
// question voiceEvalRepeatsPerPrompt times and the variation suffix is the only
// thing that differs between those calls. A fixture without it could only
// certify one of the three prompts the product sends.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is the stylometric floor the scenario claims a
// draft written to this profile reaches: how close the draft's own deterministic
// fingerprint — sentence rhythm and punctuation rates — sits to the corpus
// fingerprint, on the product's own [0,1] scale. That number is half of the
// score this site's draft is folded into, and it is the half that is decided
// here rather than by the judge: the other half is a model's opinion, and the
// rubric and the bands are where an opinion belongs. It is a FLOOR and not a
// value because a draft may legitimately land anywhere above it — pinning a
// number would fail a model for writing closer to the author than the scenario
// dared to claim.
//
// A tell is neither a wrong answer nor an unusable draft: it is a cost the
// record carries. The evaluation counts every tell the sanitizer could not
// remove, KEEPS the draft, and scores it — the count is spent later, on whether
// the whole candidate may activate, once every held-out prompt is folded
// together. So this case reports the tells beside its measurement rather than
// refusing the draft over them, because a draft the evaluation went on to grade
// is not one this record may call unmeasurable.
