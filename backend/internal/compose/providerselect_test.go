// PI-AC-9, in the words the spec uses: with no provider connected, every
// domain surface "renders not_connected honestly, REMAINS FULLY AVAILABLE, and
// performs zero outbound calls."
//
// The first implementation read that as "hide the surface" and defaulted to
// registering no adapter. The result was a capability nobody could turn on: the
// endpoint answered 501, the settings page showed no card, and connecting a
// provider needed an environment variable and a server restart. Availability
// and egress are two different questions, and only the second one is about
// safety — a registered adapter with no sealed credential can make no call.
