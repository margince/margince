// The flip's migration.Writers over the native stores — the injected
// seam that keeps the migration module blind to the record modules it
// feeds (people/deals/activities each own their write shape; every
// create below rides their audited, event-emitting entry points).
//
// Idempotency: the flip's source is a FROZEN snapshot, so a re-imported
// row (checkpoint replay, or a full re-run) can never carry different
// values than the row that already landed — Ensure answers
// "already landed" without a second write instead of upserting
// identical values through a second audit row.
//
// Fidelity gaps are DISCLOSED, never silent (IEM-FORM-2's "record every
// discarded edge"): a row whose incumbent owner has no mirror_user_map
// entry — or which names no owner at all — is imported under the flip
// operator rather than left ownerless (an ownerless native row is
// workspace-shared, while the mirror row was hidden from every seat),
// and a deal whose raw stage identity doesn't resolve lands on the
// default pipeline's first open stage — each with a disclosure line in
// the run report. OVA-MAP-6 leaves stage materialization open
// upstream; this fallback is the disclosed spec-fill.
