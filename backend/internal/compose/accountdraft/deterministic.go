// The no-model floor.
//
// It is not an error path. A deployment that runs no model lane, or a
// workspace whose budget is spent, still has a rep who pressed "Write email" —
// and a short honest opener they edit is a better answer than a spinner that
// ends in a refusal.
//
// What it will not do is imitate the model. It states only what the summary
// gave it, in plain sentences, and asks one question. No figure it was not
// handed, no claim about what the recipient thinks, no invented urgency.
