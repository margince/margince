// The A2 hosted transport's edge on the api origin: the per-request
// authenticate closure the MCP handler runs, the deployment gate that decides
// whether the route exists at all, and the two guards in front of both — an
// Origin allowlist and the rate limits that bound every internet-facing edge
// of the connector, /mcp and the authorization server alike. The tool surface
// itself is srv.toolRegistry — the SAME registry the REST agent surface
// composes, so the two transports cannot differ in capability.
//
// What the rate limits here are, stated plainly: platform/ratelimit is an
// IN-PROCESS fixed-window counter, so every ceiling below is per replica — an
// N-replica deployment multiplies each of them by N. There is no shared store
// behind them, so there is also no dependency whose outage could fail closed;
// these buckets bound one binary's exposure and claim nothing more. Moving the
// same keys into Redis is what would make a ceiling installation-wide, and it
// changes no caller here.
//
// What the Origin guard is, stated plainly: an absent Origin is ALLOWED,
// because non-browser clients send none and refusing them would break every
// CLI client. What actually stops DNS rebinding is that every verb requires a
// Bearer a rebound page cannot attach — after a rebind the request is
// same-origin and carries no Origin at all, which the absent-allowed rule
// admits. The guard is defence in depth, not the rebinding defence.
