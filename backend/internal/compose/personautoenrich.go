// Filling a person from what their employer's site ALREADY published.
//
// The deep read fills a published person onto a record the workspace already
// has (deepreadautoapply.go), and stages a stranger as a lead. Both happen
// during the read. A person who arrives AFTERWARDS — a rep typing a name, a
// first mail landing, an import — is never matched against what that site
// said, so the role printed beside their name on the about page goes unused
// and the workspace holds a contact it could have described.
//
// That is the bug the LinkedIn matcher was written to fix, in the same shape:
// matching only at read time means every later arrival is a match nobody
// would ever make. The answer is the same one — THE TRIGGER IS THE EVENT, NOT
// THE WRITER. person.created and person.updated reach the outbox because the
// write shape puts them there, so manual entry, capture, site read, merge and
// import all land here without any of them knowing this consumer exists, and
// a writer added tomorrow is covered on the day it emits its first event.
//
// What the site published is still on file as the staged lead proposals the
// read left behind: each carries the name, role, published email, LinkedIn
// URL and the verbatim snippet it was read from. So the match reads those
// rather than re-crawling a page that has not changed.
//
// A match resolves TWO things at once, which is why they are one pass: the
// person's empty fields get filled, and the proposal that would have asked a
// human to create a lead for somebody the CRM now holds stops being a
// question. Leaving it would spend the approval queue on a duplicate of the
// row that is already there.
