package compose

// In the integration build, compose binds an incumbent that refuses every call
// instead of one that reaches HubSpot.
//
// The suites were reaching it for real. WithKeyvault builds the overlay Service
// with the live factory, and Connect resolves the incumbent's portal id and its
// owners directory through it — both best-effort, so the vendor's 401 came back,
// was logged as a warning, and the suite went green while a merge gate depended
// on a third party being up (#1996). Measured at 32 connects x 2 round trips per
// overlay run, ~24s of a 34s package.
//
// Refusing rather than answering, because a fixture that answers plausibly is
// the thing this seam already has: a suite that wants connect-path behaviour
// passes its own incumbent through WithOverlayIncumbentResolver, and one that
// does not should get a named refusal it can read rather than a vendor status
// code that means nothing here.
//
// Both call sites tolerate the error by design — overlay/connection.go's
// fetchPortalID stores NULL and seedUserMapOnConnect logs and returns — so this
// changes what the suites SAY, not what they do.

// errNoLiveIncumbent is what every method below returns. It names the
// substitution to make, because the reader hitting it is running a suite that
// unexpectedly depends on incumbent behaviour and needs to know there is a seam.
//
// It WRAPS hubspot.ErrUnreachable, and that is load-bearing rather than
// decorative. jobs_overlay.go's isConnectionLevelIncumbentError is what decides
// whether a reconcile sweep aborts and backs the connection off or logs one
// object class and carries on; an error it does not recognise takes the second
// branch. So a bare sentinel here would let the fleet worker sweep a connection
// where EVERY incumbent call refused, treat each refusal as one class's data
// defect, and finish by calling RecordSweepSuccess — a green sweep that did
// nothing, which is the exact false-green this build is supposed to remove.
// "Could not reach the incumbent" is also simply what happened.
