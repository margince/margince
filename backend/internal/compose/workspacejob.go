// The scope a workspace-scoped job runs under. River's WorkerMiddleware sees
// a rivertype.JobRow — raw JSON, never the typed args — so a middleware could
// only bind by re-reading the wire key, which would leave the role declaration
// a label beside the binding rather than the thing that governs it. Binding
// from the args' own WorkspaceID() instead keeps the declaration load-bearing:
// a worker cannot claim one workspace and work in another.

// workspaceJobCtx binds the workspace the args themselves declare, and only
// that. Provenance stays where it already is — each pass names its own actor
// and mints its own correlation id, and moving that here would change what the
// audit rows say about work whose behaviour is meant to be untouched.
//
// A zero id is REFUSED rather than bound. Nothing downstream narrows a query
// by workspace — no table carries the column and no policy reads one
// (ADR-0061/ADR-0091 §5) — so an unrefused zero would not fail here or at any
// later statement; it would simply be the value an audit entity id, a blob key
// or an advisory-lock name carries instead of the real one, discovered only
// much later and far from the job that produced it. It is also what an args
// type decodes to when a queued job predates a change to its wire key, so the
// refusal is the difference between a loud failure and a pass that quietly
// touches nothing.
