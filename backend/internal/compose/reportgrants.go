// Vocabulary that reads ANOTHER record type than the report's own.
//
// The engine's admission gate covers spec.entity — the projects of a project
// report, the activities of an activity report. A measure that folds the
// deals under a project, or a dimension that names the project an activity
// is filed under, reads a second record type, and the caller owes that
// type's read grant as much as they owe the first. Without this, a seat
// holding project.read alone would total deal money it could not list, and a
// seat holding activity.read alone would learn which projects exist.
//
// A name the caller ASKS for without the grant is refused (403), on the
// report and on the drill-through alike. A name the caller never asked for is
// simply not served: the default plan drops it, and the drill-through omits
// its column — the same answer shape a narrower seat gets everywhere else.
