// The REST door's half of the four outbound commands
// (margince/margince#928 task 7): a mail reply, a channel reply, an
// account-started send and a booking. Unlike every family before them, each of
// these has a real tool-door twin resolving the SAME command — so a refusal
// the tool made and this door skipped (an empty `to`, an empty `links`, a link
// over the cap, a link held in another system of record, a booking whose end
// precedes its start, an anchor that is not a channel conversation) is now one
// refusal both doors reach.
//
// These are also the first decoders that read the request BODY for operands
// rather than only for a create's fields: a send names its addressees there,
// and a booking names its slot and its records. body is the same buffered copy
// stageRefusal already hashed into canonicalRESTCall — a stream has one honest
// reading, and the gate has already taken it.

// commandBody decodes the buffered body into one decoder's view of it.
//
// An ABSENT body answers the zero value rather than an error. The two enrich
// routes declare their body optional in crm.yaml ("With no body the org's own
// domain is read") and are the pair that reaches this branch legitimately;
// everywhere else it hands the resolver a command with empty operands and lets
// the resolver decide.
//
// That division is the point, and it is not "the gate never refuses a bad
// request" — several resolvers here refuse an absent operand outright, an
// empty `to` among them. It is that a DECODER has no standing to. Guards
// refuses what the EXECUTOR would refuse anyway, deliberately and with the
// executor's own sentence, so that a human's one-shot approval is not spent
// discovering it. A decoder erroring on a missing field would instead invent a
// refusal nobody else makes, for a field no resolver asked about, on the agent
// door only — and the same mistake would then carry one machine code for a
// passport and the handler's own for a session.
//
// Unreadable JSON is different: no resolver can be handed operands that were
// never legible. It is refused with the code httperr.Decode answers on the
// session half of the same route — the rule advanceDealCommand
// (agentcommandlifecycle.go) already follows for the same reason.
