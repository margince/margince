// The overlay connection lifecycle, assembled: overlay.Service over the
// pool and the secret vault, wired into overlay.Handlers — composed here
// so overlay never imports keyvault's concrete provider selection (the
// same posture capture.go documents for NewCaptureRegistry). This also
// wires the sync-status/budget surface: the shared OVB meter every
// force-fresh read and the budget read must agree on, the
// canonical->incumbent class translator SyncStatus's backfill-
// completeness lookup needs, and the mapping registry's current projection
// fingerprints, which the flip preflight compares every mirror row against.
// All three are injected here because the overlay module must never import
// its own hubspot subpackage — that subpackage imports IT.
// ReconcileOverlay's on-demand sweep request
// (overlay.Service.RequestSweep) needs none of this compose-level wiring —
// it only marks the workspace due, which the worker's own periodic sweep
// (jobs_overlay.go) then picks up.
