// Re-matching LinkedIn ghosts as the CRM fills up (ADR-0078 §2.1b).
//
// The upload handler matches once, against whatever the workspace happened to
// know at that second. On a new installation that is close to nothing: an
// export is uploaded during onboarding, and the people and accounts it could
// match arrive over the following hours as mail capture runs. Every one of
// those arrivals is a match that the upload could not have made and that
// nothing else was going to make either — the ghost stays unmatched forever,
// and the account page keeps saying nobody here knows anyone.
//
// Measured on a real 5,064-row export: 54 of the workspace's contacts appeared
// in it by name, and the upload-time pass matched 13. The rest were people and
// employers the CRM learned about minutes later.
//
// The MATCH only ever looks at unmatched ghosts, so a decision a human has
// already made is never revisited. The pass around it is wider, deliberately:
// it also PROPOSES, and a suggestion that never became a proposal is invisible
// to everyone until some pass re-reaches it. So the enumeration takes undecided
// ghosts of either status and runs the staging pass for each owner it finds.
//
// That costs one re-read plus one idempotent staging attempt per outstanding
// suggestion, and it is paid even when every one of them has already been
// refused — a refusal is recorded on the approval, not on the ghost row, so
// nothing here can tell those apart. A caught-up workspace still costs one
// query; a workspace holding refusals does not.
