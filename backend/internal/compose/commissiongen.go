package compose

// The cg:commissions consumer: a won deal becomes what its partner earned.
//
// The trigger is the event, not the writer. deal.stage_changed reaches the
// outbox because the write shape puts it there, so every path that can win a
// deal — a rep on the board, an approved agent proposal, an import — lands here
// without any of them knowing this consumer exists. Asking each writer to
// remember to accrue would guarantee one of them forgets, and the one that
// forgot would be invisible: nothing looks different about a partner who was
// never paid.
//
// It lives in compose because the call crosses three modules. deals owns the
// event, people owns the partner's margin tier, commissions owns the ledger,
// and a module never imports a sibling — so the edge is injected here.
//
// EVERYTHING IS READ FROM THE EVENT, not from the deal. A reopened deal clears
// its frozen FX rate, and its attribution can be edited after the win, so a
// read-back would price the accrual on facts that changed after the moment
// being paid for. The payload carries what was true when the deal was won,
// which is the only reading that stays true.
//
// Replay is handled by the ledger, not here: commission_entry.trigger_event_id
// is unique, so a redelivered event fails its insert instead of paying twice.
// The events.Dedupe wrapper is a cache in front of that, never the guarantee —
// it marks AFTER the effect runs, so a crash in that window replays.
