// A tier the contract declares binds every door that can reach the effect.
//
// #982 was not a missing line; it was a vocabulary mismatch nothing could see.
// The contract tightens per OPERATION, a tool declares per VERB, and where one
// verb serves seven record types the tightening had nowhere to live on the tool
// door — so `createProject` was confirm-first on one door and auto-execute on the
// other, and no test failed.
//
// These gates are derived from the generated policy table rather than from a list
// of today's affected pairs. A new `x-mcp-tool` annotation that tightens a record
// type a generic verb already performs regenerates that table and fails here until
// the floor and the staging behind it exist.
//
// What they do NOT prove is that the floor is WIRED into the served registry, or
// that it runs before admission. No unit test in this package can: the floor is a
// function the composition passes and the tier is decided inside Admit. The
// integration lane proves both, for a create and for an update — see
// agenttierfloor_integration_test.go.

// tightenedPairs are the (verb, record type) pairs whose tier the contract
// tightens BEYOND what the verb itself declares, for an effect that verb actually
// performs. That is the whole subject of #982 and the set these gates walk.
//
// Both filters matter. A pair whose verb is already confirm-first needs no floor.
// A route that is not the record's own collection route — a fact write, a
// stakeholder membership, a retire action — is a different operation borrowing
// this verb's annotation, and inheriting its tightening would stage every ordinary
// patch of that record type. A record type the verb cannot serve is not a tightening
// at all: the call is refused at the provider, and staging it first would spend a
// human's yes on a call that was never going to run.
