// The certification case for site_extract/profile.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: the excerpt
// corpus comes from profileExcerptPages, the numbering from newSnippetIndex, the
// request from profileRequest and the verdict from gateProfile — the same four
// steps the deep read takes, in the same order. A case that rebuilt any of them
// would measure a copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks
// the original.
//
// The numbered index is the sharp edge here, because it decides three things at
// once: which passages the model is shown, which ids this call's response schema
// offers, and which text the citation gate resolves an id back into. So the index
// is built once, in Prepare, and the request and the gate both take it. A case
// that pinned a schema, or numbered the passages a second time, would let the
// model cite an id the gate reads as some other passage — and certify a mismatch
// as a clean read.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here: the profile fields that must survive the
// citation gate, with the values they must carry, and — separately — the fields
// this crawl must NOT ground at all. The lane grounds company fields against
// cited passages, so what it is right or wrong about is a field: it either
// grounds the one the scenario named, or it grounds something else, or it
// grounds nothing.
//
// The positive half is a subset claim, never an inventory: a real site grounds
// more fields than a scenario cares to pin, and demanding exhaustiveness would
// fail a read for being richer than its author imagined. The negative half is
// the opposite kind of claim and needs its own words for exactly that reason —
// a subset claim can say what must be there and can never say what must not,
// and "must not" is the whole content of a page that grounds nothing and a
// legal notice that names two entities.
