// Reaching a company's site when the one URL we derived from its domain does
// not answer.
//
// A domain becomes a seed as `https://<domain>` and nothing else (people's
// EnrichTargetURL, capture's auto-enrich). That is the right first guess and
// the wrong only guess: a site can serve TLS on www but not on the apex, or
// have no TLS at all. On a real import of 162 companies, 37 site reads died on
// the seed fetch having read zero pages, and half of those answer perfectly
// well on another host or scheme — so half the companies with no logo, no
// facts and no profile had a reachable website the whole time.
//
// This is the ladder a browser walks when a person types a bare domain, and
// nothing more: the same site, named the way that site actually publishes it.

// land on, which is the whole gap; chaining them would let a site walk the
// crawler through as many fetches as it cares to write, and a cycle of two
// pages pointing at each other would never end. A refresh that leaves the
