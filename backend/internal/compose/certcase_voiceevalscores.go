// The certification case for voice_build/eval_scores — the bounded judge call a
// voice build asks about its own held-out drafts, and half of every score it
// activates or refuses a candidate on.
//
// It certifies the shipped path rather than a description of it: Run drives
// judgeVoiceDrafts, the function the evaluation loop calls, and Evaluate reads
// the answer with readVoiceJudgeScores, the reading that decides whether the
// evaluation has a verdict at all. A case that rebuilt either would measure a
// copy, and a copy stays green through the change that breaks the original.
//
// What the expectation MEANS here is an ORDER, not a score: which of the judged
// drafts must be scored above which. A score is one model's opinion on a
// continuous scale and no two models put the same number on the same prose —
// pinning one would fail a judge for agreeing in different units. What the site
// is FOR survives that: the evaluation's whole use of these numbers is
// comparative, so a judge that ranks the author's own rhythm above generic AI
// prose is doing its job whatever numbers it wrote, and one that does not is
// wrong however confident it sounds.
//
// The ranking is a chain and a SUBSET claim: a scenario names the drafts whose
// order it is willing to defend and says nothing about the rest, because three
// repeats of one prompt are routinely near-identical and demanding a total order
// over them would fail a judge for being unable to invent a difference.
//
// Ties break the claim. A tie is the judge saying it cannot tell two drafts
// apart, and telling drafts apart is the entire job.
