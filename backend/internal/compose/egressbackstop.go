// refuseUngovernedAgentEgress is the backstop under EVERY write that lands in
// an external system of record. Such a write leaves our boundary and appears
// in a third party's CRM, and mirrored content is T2 — attacker-influenceable
// by design — so a manipulated agent must not place content there on its own
// authority (AC-OV-5).
//
// It answers the DECLARED unsupported-by-SoR result rather than "needs
// approval", because in this build there is no approval an agent could
// actually get for it: staging one requires an authority object a human can
// both see and release, and for a mirrored target neither holds — the
// decidability probe reads our own tables, and the redemption version pin
// re-reads a row that does not exist. Answering "needs human release" would
// name a path that dead-ends, which is exactly what the unsupported sentinel
// exists to avoid. Confirm-first agent write-back is therefore blocked on the
// approvals layer being able to describe a non-authoritative target at all —
// both its decidability probe and its redemption pin read our own tables. The
// released-approval check below is the seam such a change would plug into,
// which is why it stays even though nothing can set the marker on this path
// today: a future released approval must not be refused by the gate it was
// granted for.
//
// It gates only verbs the overlay adapter actually serves, so an agent asking
// for a permanently unsupported one still gets that answer from the provider
// (with its own object-RBAC and row-scope checks) rather than this one, and
// so "every write" stays true by construction as SupportsWrite changes.
//
// It sits on updateInMode/archiveInMode rather than Update/Archive so the
// REST write shadow, which dispatches through those directly, cannot slip
// underneath it. A human in their own seat is not gated here: that is object
// RBAC's question, per ADR-0055's split between seat authority and agent
// autonomy.
//
// Running ahead of the provider's own auth.Require means an agent with no
// grant learns the workspace runs on an incumbent before it learns it lacks
// permission. That discloses nothing: /me reports system_of_record.mode to
// every authenticated principal by contract, so the mode is not a secret this
// ordering could leak — and the answer is identical for a record that exists
// and one that does not, so it is no existence oracle either.
