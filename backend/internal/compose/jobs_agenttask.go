// River wiring for the MCP task-retention pass: a dispatcher over EVERY
// workspace and a worker that purges one. It sits beside the other per-concern
// job files rather than in jobs.go, which owns the runner's assembly.
//
// It reads almost exactly like jobs_retention.go, and that similarity cannot be
// factored away — hence the file-wide waiver above. addDeclaredWorker is generic
// over the CLOSED set of declared args types, so each kind needs its own
// concrete pair for the registration to compile at all; a shared helper would
// have to be generic over both the args type and its sweeper, and would then be
// one indirection wrapping two lines. It is why every jobs_*.go file in this
// package repeats the shape.
