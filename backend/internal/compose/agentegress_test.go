// The egress obligation as a fitness function: an operation that lets its
// CALLER name a URL the server will fetch must never be 🟢 for an agent.
//
// A caller-chosen absolute URL, fetched from the server's own address with
// the caller's path and query, is an outbound channel whose destination the
// product does not choose. netguard refuses non-public addresses, which is
// the SSRF question; it is not this one — an attacker's own internet host is
// public by definition, and the request reaches it before any model call, so
// the fetch succeeds even when the extraction it was ostensibly for fails.
// The only control that binds is a human deciding the call, which is what 🟡
// means.
//
// Derived from the contract, not maintained as a list: the URL-taking set is
// whatever the request schemas say it is, so a new endpoint that accepts one
// is covered the day it is written.
