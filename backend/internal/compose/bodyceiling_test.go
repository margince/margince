// The security property, stated once: a body's ceiling is decided by the route
// it is addressed to, never by what the sender says the body is.
//
// The version of this that shipped chose on Content-Type alone, which handed
// the file bound to every route in the product. Several decode `r.Body` with
// no bound of their own — `/oauth/register` and `/v1/auth/login` among them,
// both unauthenticated — so a one-header lie was a 25x memory amplification on
// an anonymous endpoint. `TestALyingContentTypeBuysNothing` is that attack.
//
// The declaration gates — that the ceiling table matches the routes which
// actually carry files — live in bodyceilingcensus_test.go.

// testLimits are deliberately three DIFFERENT numbers, none of them a shipped
// default. A test that gives every route the same ceiling passes just as
// happily against a table that hands every route the same one, and a table
// wired to the wrong field is the likelier mistake than one wired to nothing.
