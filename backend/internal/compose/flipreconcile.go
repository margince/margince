// Repairing the identity map after a crashed flip.
//
// A landing is one transaction: the native row and the identity map row
// that names it commit together, so a process that dies mid-landing
// leaves neither. What this repairs is what predates that — a record
// created by an earlier attempt, when the two were separate transactions
// and a crash between them left something the resume cannot recognize
// and would create a second time.
//
// One window survives by design and is not this scan's to close: a deal
// is born on an open stage and advanced to its terminal one afterwards
// (the store's open-birth rule), so a crash there leaves a MAPPED deal
// parked open. settleAdoptedDeal finishes it.
//
// The repair is possible because the flip stamps `source` inside the
// RESERVED import namespace, which every client-facing create wire
// refuses (shared/kernel/provenance). So a native row bearing the
// reserved prefix can only have been written by an importer — which is
// what makes reading provenance back safe here, when reading the
// client-writable part of it would not be. The prefix names the
// incumbent and the class, not a run: another attempt's orphan is
// precisely what this adopts.
//
// Adoption is restricted to LIVE rows. A row that was archived or
// merged away since the crash is a tombstone: binding an external id to
// it would suppress the real estate record — the import would report it
// converged, never create it, and every activity resolving through that
// identity would attach to the tombstone's survivor. Left unadopted, it
// simply gets created properly.
