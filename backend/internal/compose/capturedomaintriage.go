// Triage-on-capture (the trigger half): the moment a captured mail meets a
// domain nobody has judged, its site read is queued — rather than waiting for
// the next daily sweep to notice the open question.
//
// The shape is the auto-enrich trigger's, and for the same reasons: it is
// best-effort in the enqueue direction because the sweep is the reconciler, and
// it does no crawling itself. The difference is what a miss costs. A missed
// enrich leaves a company without a dossier; a missed triage leaves a PERSON
// whose company nobody has decided on, so the sweep matters more here, not less.
