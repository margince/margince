// The wire's DERIVED slots: the ones the mirror carries no key for, computed
// from the mirrored collections the same body already publishes. A derived
// slot has two ways to be wrong that a mapped one does not — it can compute
// from the wrong row, and it can invent a value where the native path
// publishes none — so each is held here to the answer the native read path
// gives for the same facts.
//
// The payloads are canonical rather than seeded through the HubSpot mapping,
// which lands exactly one domain row: what is under test is which of SEVERAL
// rows the derivation picks, a shape no incumbent fixture can pose. That the
// derivation survives the real ingest pipeline end to end is the wire
// reachability gate's assertion, on the same binding.
