// What one reading of one transcript does, from claiming the run record to
// closing it.
//
// The division of labour with transcriptpropose.go is: that file owns the
// question put to the model and what may come back, this one owns the run — the
// claim, the staging, and the three outcomes a rep can be shown. Keeping the
// outcomes here is deliberate, because the difference between them is the
// product: "still reading", "read it and it stated nothing", and "could not
// read it" must never collapse into one another.
