// The completeness gate for the governance seam: every operation an agent can
// MUTATE anything through decodes into a typed command, and nothing else does.
//
// It replaces four family-shaped walks — one per operation family, each with
// its own filter (a route shape, a tier, a tool verb) and its own remembered
// count. Between them they happened to cover the whole surface, but a set of
// partial gates that unions to completeness is not a completeness gate: the
// filters were written independently, and a route none of them selected was
// covered by none of them. updateOfferTemplate spent two tasks in exactly that
// position, because one walk filtered on the method PATCH and its route is a
// PUT, while the walk that would otherwise have caught it stood down on the
// grounds that the first one had it.
//
// So there is one subject set here and no filter inside it: Access "tool" and
// a mutating method, which is precisely what the gate admits an agent to and
// therefore precisely what may reach staging. The per-family tests that remain
// assert something this one does not — decoding a real body, staging the right
// target — and each says so where it stands.

// can say what it binds to — the refusal a human is asked to release names a
// target the door never resolved. A surplus entry is a decoder answering for an
// operation no agent reaches, which reads as coverage and is not: the same
// entry would go on looking correct after the contract retired the route it
// belongs to.
//
// The count is derived on both sides rather than written down. A remembered
// literal is a second source of truth about the contract, and it goes stale in
// the direction that reads as success: a route the contract adds fails a count
// of 69 with a message about arithmetic, where what actually happened is that
// an operation arrived with no governed call.
