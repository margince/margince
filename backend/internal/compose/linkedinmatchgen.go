// The cg:linkedin-match consumer: a ghost attaches the moment its contact
// exists (ADR-0078 §8b).
//
// A workspace does not learn its contacts all at once. The LinkedIn export is
// uploaded during onboarding; the people it could match are created over the
// following hours and weeks — by mail capture, by a site read, by a rep typing
// a name in. Matching only at upload time meant every one of those arrivals
// was a match nobody would ever make.
//
// The trigger is the event, not the writer. person.created and person.updated
// reach the outbox because the write shape puts them there, so manual entry,
// capture, site read, merge and import all land here without any of them
// knowing this consumer exists — and a NEW writer added tomorrow is covered on
// the day it emits its first event. Asking each writer to remember to call the
// matcher would guarantee that one of them forgets.
//
// Organization events matter for the same reason and a sharper one: most
// unmatched ghosts are waiting on an employer, not on a name, so an account
// appearing unblocks a batch of them at once.
//
// It lives in compose because the call crosses modules — the events are the
// people module's own, but the seam that reacts to them is nobody's private
// business.
//
// Both halves are idempotent, so the at-least-once bus costs nothing — for two
// different reasons, which is worth saying because only one of them is the old
// one. A redelivered event re-runs a match that changes no row, because only
// UNMATCHED ghosts are ever matched. The proposal that now follows it considers
// SUGGESTED ones too, which is the point of proposing at all, and is idempotent
// because staging takes the proposal's identity lock and joins the live offer
// rather than minting a second copy of the same question.
