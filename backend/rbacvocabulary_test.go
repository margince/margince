// The RBAC vocabulary is DECLARED in the contract and restated in Go, and the
// two must not drift.
//
// api/crm.yaml's RbacObject and RbacAction enums are what the web client types
// every capability check against: `openapi-typescript` renders them as string
// unions, so a button scoped to a misspelled object is a compile error there.
// That guarantee is only worth as much as the enum's agreement with the server
// — an object the contract omits produces a union the client cannot express,
// and an object the contract invents produces a check that always denies while
// looking deliberate.
//
// Go cannot derive its half. oapi-codegen names enums after parent+property
// (AuthorizationSeatType) and emits nothing at all for a top-level standalone
// string enum, so there are no generated constants for policy.go to derive
// from. These gates close that hole the other way: both lists stay
// hand-written, and merging them out of agreement is impossible.
//
// Both sides are DERIVED, neither restated here — the object list is
// AST-parsed from policy.go (coreObjectsFromSource, rbacvocabularysource_test.go) and
// the action list from principal.ObjectGrant's fields. A test that spelled the
// vocabulary a third time would drift exactly like the two it is watching.
