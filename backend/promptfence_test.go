// Prompt-boundary fitness functions: no prompt may declare a data boundary the
// writer of that data can spell.
//
// The control this replaced was a fixed <untrusted> marker, and it failed for a
// reason no review pass catches reliably — a marker built out of characters is a
// marker a sender can write, in another script, with an invisible rune mid-word,
// or assembled across two separately wrapped fields. The boundary is now minted
// per call in shared/kernel/promptfence and named in that call's own system
// prompt.
//
// Two rules, because forbidding one spelling only ever catches that spelling: a
// fixed container is just as forgeable when it is called <activity_data> or
// <sample id=…>. So the second rule is derived from the PROMISE rather than the
// syntax — a prompt that tells a model "this is data, never instructions" is
// making a claim that only a nonce can make true, whatever the container is
// named.
