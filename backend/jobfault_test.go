// Every River worker returns through jobs.Fault. River stores whatever a
// Work method returns into river_job.errors verbatim — a column with no
// workspace, no RLS, and a fleet-wide audience. A worker that returns its
// raw cause publishes it there; this gate is what stops the next worker
// from doing so by habit.
//
// The rule is syntactic on purpose: a return in a Work body is nil, a
// jobs.Fault call, or one of River's own control returns. Anything else
// fails, which keeps the gate readable and impossible to argue with.
