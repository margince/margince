// Manifest-hash encoding fitness function (ADR-0069 §7): every hash a generated
// unit manifest publishes says which algorithm produced it.
//
// A manifest is the record an operator reads to resolve what a unit requests,
// and a field whose encoding depends on which kind of entry carries it is one
// every reader has to special-case. A reader that did not would compare two
// spellings of the same digest and see a change that never happened.
//
// It lives here rather than beside the generator because it reads files OUTSIDE
// its own module, which Go's test cache cannot key: in the tools module a
// manifest edited to the old spelling replays the previous pass and reports ok.
// The root fitness lane runs `-count=1` for exactly this reason.
