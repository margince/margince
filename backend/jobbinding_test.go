// PROHIBITION, so "found nothing" is what success looks like — which means it
// would also read green if the walker silently matched no files at all. The
// floor counts the POSITIVE side instead: Work methods that reach
// workspaceJobCtx at all.
//
// It counts REACHES, not "binds through": several workers call the helper for
// its zero-id refusal and then bind through a per-kind scope helper that takes
// the workspace as a parameter. Those two values agree today because both come
// from the same args field, but nothing here asserts that — see the follow-up
// note in the job-observability ledger.

// River's WorkerMiddleware sees a rivertype.JobRow — raw JSON, never the typed
// args — so the binding cannot live there. It lives in compose's
// workspaceJobCtx, and this gate keeps a Work body from binding inline beside
// it.
//
// A worker that bound its own workspace from job.Args could declare one field
// and bind another, or bind a zero UUID, with the role gate in jobrole_test.go
// still green. That is the drift this prevents.
