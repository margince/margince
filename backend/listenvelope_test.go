// The contract's list envelope has ONE shape, and something depends on that.
//
// httperr.recordsIn counts what a REST response hands over by reading the
// envelope rather than a list of response type names: a struct carrying a `Data`
// slice is a page, and its length is the record count charged against the agent
// read bound (MCP-SESS-READS). A list response that spelled its page some other
// way would be counted as ONE record however many it served — silently, because
// a wrong number is still a number.
//
// So the rule the counter assumes is asserted here over the generated contract,
// which is the only place it can be: a list shape added tomorrow either carries
// `Data []T` or fails this test.
