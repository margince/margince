// The enabled set must be a set git actually has.
//
// .gitignore carries `/extensions/*` with a per-unit un-ignore list, so a new
// first-party unit is IGNORED BY DEFAULT. That is the right default — the
// directory is the installation-owned enabled set, and an operator's units are
// not this repository's business — but it means a contributor adding a unit
// meant to ship in the vanilla tree has to remember one line in a file they
// were not otherwise editing.
//
// Nothing caught it. `make composition`, `make migrate`,
// `make check-ext-migrations` and the whole of `make check` read the WORKING
// TREE, so every one of them is green over a unit that no clone of this
// repository has: the composition composes it, the migration gate applies its
// SQL, its tests run — and `git add extensions/<name>/` adds nothing, the
// commit lands with the directory absent, and CI builds a vanilla tree without
// it. The shipped artifact and the gated artifact are two different things,
// which is the exact failure class a fitness test exists for. notes hit it;
// docs/how-to/add-an-extension.md had already warned about it in prose, and
// prose was not enough.
//
// It asks git rather than parsing .gitignore because git is the authority: the
// pattern language has precedence rules (a later negation, a directory-level
// .gitignore, .git/info/exclude) that a reimplementation would get subtly
// wrong, and being subtly wrong here is indistinguishable from passing.
