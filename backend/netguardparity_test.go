// The egress SSRF denylist exists twice, and this is where the two are held
// equal. internal/platform/netguard owns the guard the core dials through;
// pkg/extension PUBLISHES the same ranges, because an extension unit is its own
// module and may import only the published pkg/** surface.
//
// It used to be published nowhere, so a unit that dials a member-supplied host
// hand-copied the literals and this test read that unit's file off disk. That
// worked only while the unit lived in this repository — and the drift it guarded
// against was not a style difference but the way around the core's guard: a
// range the core refuses and the copy admits is an internal address a member can
// name. Publishing the list removes the class of bug instead of re-testing it,
// and what remains to guard is these two lists inside this one module.
//
// It compares the parsed networks rather than file text: the two are formatted
// and grouped differently on purpose.
