// A unit's own vocabulary for the ways its background work fails, and the
// wrapper a job returns to speak it.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES is that a job failure reaches an operator through
// river_job.errors, a fleet-wide column every admin reads. The job layer
// therefore refuses to persist a cause's own text and substitutes a sentence
// from a closed vocabulary — otherwise a
// provider that named the phone number it refused would have published it,
// fleet-wide, for as long as River retains the row.
//
// The cost was that a unit's classification did not survive the trip. zalo-oa
// computes `provider_unavailable` versus `token_rejected` versus
// `package_too_low` — three failures with three different people to go fix them
// — writes the class to its own connection row, and then returned a plain error
// the job layer could only report as unclassifiable. An operator reading
// Maintenance was told to go read a log, with no key to find the line by.
//
// So the vocabulary grows a COMPOSED HALF rather than the redaction being
// relaxed. A class is a token and two fixed sentences the unit WROTE, declared
// as inert data next to its tools and its jobs; nothing a remote party said can
// reach the column through it, because nothing a remote party said is in it.
//
// A NAME IS NOT A DISPOSITION, which is the second thing this file owns. Failure
// and Reschedule carry the same class and ask for opposite outcomes — one spends
// the job's attempts and becomes dead work an operator is shown, the other
// reschedules the same tick and shows nobody anything. A unit chooses between
// them by whether the failure needs a human at all, and a provider nobody can
// reach is the case that needs none.

// type is that classification keeps working while the persisted text is fixed —
// so a caller wrapping a sentinel does not lose it here.
//
// It takes the CLASS VALUE rather than its token so that the value a unit hands
// over is the value the boot validated — the unit passes the same package-level
// value it declared, and the job layer compares what arrives against what was
// registered. A token alone would have made the two impossible to compare: the
// sentence is the field that reaches the operator, and a lookup by token would
// have accepted any sentence travelling under a declared name.
//
// Nothing here checks that the class is one the unit declared. It cannot: this is
// a plain constructor holding no view of the composed set, and a unit's tick is
// the last place that should discover a typo by panicking.
//
// SO THE JOB LAYER CHECKS BEFORE IT PUBLISHES, and that check is load-bearing
// rather than belt-and-braces. This constructor accepts ANY value — including one
// whose Sentence a unit formatted out of the cause, which is the accident the
// whole seam exists to prevent — so the sentence is persisted only when the
// installation registered exactly this value, all three fields, for the kind that
// is failing. An unregistered one falls through to the core sentinel vocabulary,
// and persists the unclassified substitute only when nothing there matches either;
// the cause goes to the log in both cases. Declaring a class is what makes it
// publishable, so forgetting to declare one costs the operator this unit's own
// wording and never a classification the failure would have had regardless.
