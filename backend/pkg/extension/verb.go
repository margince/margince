// Verb is ONE governed operation an extension's contract fragment declares:
// the route, the method, the agent tool verb behind it, and the governance
// an operator resolves (tier, scope) plus the prose and schemas a client is
// shown.
//
// It exists because the CONTRACT is the surface. A unit's Go declaration says
// only which verbs it has behavior for (Tool is {Name, Handle}); everything a
// reader, a client, a reviewer or an operator needs to know about the
// operation lives in extensions/<name>/api/<contract>.yaml, is merged into the
// effective contract by gen-composition, and arrives back at the process as
// this value — re-emitted into the generated composition as LITERALS. That
// last part is the load-bearing one: the boot refusals in
// compose/extensiontools.go read Tier, RequestedScope and Description, and
// they must keep refusing in a bare binary with no repository on disk, so the
// composed program carries the declaration rather than reading the YAML back.
//
// A Verb is inert data, like every other part of this surface — no handle into
// the core, nothing to retain. The generator produces it; nothing an extension
// author writes in Go constructs one.

	// OperationID is the merged contract's operationId — the identity every
	// generated client, the docs and the manifest agree on.
	OperationID string
	// Route is the operation's path AS THE CONTRACT SPELLS IT — relative to the
	// contract's own `servers` url, which ends in /v1. So it reads
	// /ext/<unit>/…, exactly like every core path (/me, /auth/login), and is a
	// verbatim copy of the merged document's `paths` key rather than anything
	// derived from it. It is namespaced to the declaring unit (the composer
	// enforces it) so no fragment can squat a core path.
	//
	// This is NOT the path a server mounts. For that, see ServedPath, which is
	// the one place the base path is prepended. The field holds the contract
	// spelling because that is the spelling that can be CHECKED: it appears in
	// the published document, so it can be compared to it, and the manifest
	// digest pins something an operator can find by reading the contract.
	Route string

	// x-mcp-tool). Every extension operation backs one today: an operation
	// with no tool would publish a route this tier has no way to serve, so the
	// composer refuses it rather than declaring a route nothing can register.
