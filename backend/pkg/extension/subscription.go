// It is the BEHAVIOR half of a subscription, exactly as ToolHandler is a tool's
// and JobHandler is a job's, and like them it is not derivable from the AST —
// the manifest records WHAT a unit subscribes to, and this is the part a static
// document cannot hold.
//
// rt arrives HERE, at delivery, because a declaration is inert data: a
// Subscription value sitting in a slice holds no route into the core. The core
// mints rt for this one delivery and releases it when the handler returns.
//
// THERE IS NOBODY BEHIND A DELIVERY. rt.Caller() answers the zero Caller and
// rt.Tx(…).Core() refuses, for the same reason a job tick's does: a core write
// is checked against the caller's own permissions and a bus event has no
// caller. A handler may read and write the unit's OWN tables, audit those
// writes, and publish — which is what reacting to a fact consists of.
//
// THE BUS IS AT-LEAST-ONCE. The core suppresses the redelivery it can see (the
// same event to the same subscription), but a handler must still be safe to run
// twice: the suppression is a cache, and a crash between the effect and the ack
// is exactly the case it cannot cover. Returning an error leaves the entry
// pending and re-delivers it later; returning nil acks it. So a handler that
// cannot succeed — a malformed payload, a subject it does not recognize —
// returns nil and logs, rather than failing forever on a delivery no retry can
// fix.

//
// The event list is DECLARED rather than filtered in code, and that is a
// governance property rather than a convenience: it is derived into the unit's
