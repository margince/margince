// reservedCIDRs are the non-public ranges the stdlib predicates miss: the
// this-network block, CGNAT, benchmarking, documentation, protocol assignments,
// broadcast and discard space, plus the IPv6 ranges that CARRY an IPv4 address
// inside them — both NAT64 prefixes, 6to4 and its relay anycast,
// IPv4-compatible and IPv4-translated — which To4()/IsPrivate() do not catch,
// and which are therefore how an internal address is named without looking like
// one. Naming them IS the guard, so they are literals.
//
// WHY THEY ARE PUBLISHED. A unit that dials a host one of its own members
// supplied needs this denylist, and a unit is its own module that may import
// only pkg/**. Before this existed the only way to have it was to hand-copy the
// literals, which is a copy that drifts — and a range the core refuses while the
// copy admits it is not a formatting difference, it is a member naming an
// internal address and reaching it. The list is the same list as
// internal/platform/netguard's, and netguardparity_test.go holds the two equal.
//
// IPv4-MAPPED ::ffff:0:0/96 is deliberately absent, and is not the same thing as
// IPv4-translated below: it is an ordinary host under a second spelling, folded
// through To4() by both the stdlib predicates and net.IPNet.Contains, so
// ::ffff:127.0.0.1 is already refused as loopback while ::ffff:8.8.8.8 stays
// reachable. Listing it would block the public internet.
