//
// A unit's contract declares each request schema with
// additionalProperties: false, and NOTHING between a client and a handler
// enforces it — so this is where that promise is kept. encoding/json's
// DisallowUnknownFields is necessary and not sufficient: the decoder matches
// field names case-INSENSITIVELY, tolerates a member repeated, accepts `null`
// where an object is declared, and stops reading after the first value. Each
// admits a document the schema does not, and three of the four decide which
// value a mutation stores.
//
// It is published rather than written once per unit because it is a SECURITY
// property with a fixed answer: a second copy in the next unit is a second copy
// that can be subtly weaker, and the failure — a caller sending `bdy` and being
// told the write succeeded — is silent in every one of them.
//
// T is a struct whose json tags name the operation's declared arguments. A
// non-struct T declares no names, so every member is unknown and the document
// is refused, which is the safe direction for a programming error.
