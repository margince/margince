// Package extension is the published declaration surface of the stable
// extension tier: one named, versioned, compile-time unit
// under root extensions/<name>/ that lands without editing any
// upstream-owned file. An extension exports `func New() extension.Extension`
// returning its declaration as a plain value; the generated composition
// (build/composition/, emitted by tools/gen-composition) collects every
// enabled unit's value and the process roles reconcile the set into the
// core registries at boot — the ONE registration idiom.
//
// A declaration is inert data: it holds no handle into the core and
// extensions share no memory through it — each New() builds its own
// value, and only the boot reconciliation (after the whole set
// validated) applies anything. Capabilities are fields; a new capability
// kind is a new field, so existing declarations and extension test
// suites keep compiling (grow additively, never in place). New
// gains a Deps parameter through a versioned successor when the first
// capability needs injected dependencies.
//
// # Stability
//
// THIS SURFACE IS NOT YET STABLE, and the "grow additively" rule above
// describes the intent rather than a promise already in force. Until the first
// v1.0.0 release tag the freeze gate (scripts/check-pkg-freeze.sh, `make
// pkg-freeze`) is ADVISORY: an incompatible change prints and does not block.
// From v1.0.0 it is enforcing and a break must be ratified.
//
// Two parts of the surface are expected to change INCOMPATIBLY before that tag,
// named here so nobody builds on them believing otherwise:
//
//   - Runtime.Tx, which hands out arbitrary SQL and so cannot make a unit's
//     write carry the audit and event records the core's own repositories are
//     required to write.
//
//     This entry USED to say Tx would be removed and replaced by a governed
//     mutation returning change descriptors. It is now joined by two doors
//     instead. Tx.Core() makes the core's own write onto the product's records
//     — the RBAC check, the audit row, the outbox event, the attribution — and
//     Tx.Record writes the ledger row and the bus event for what the unit's own
//     SQL did. Between them a unit's write can carry everything a core write
//     carries, which is what the descriptor design was reaching for; Tx's three
//     SQL verbs stay for the unit's OWN tables, which is what they were always
//     the right shape for.
//
//     What remains unstable is their REACH: a unit's SQL runs on the shared
//     application role today, and narrowing it to a per-unit database role
//     (issue #628) is a change every unit's SQL feels. And Record is OFFERED,
//     not enforced — a unit may still write its tables and record nothing — so
//     a later release that makes recording mandatory would be felt by any unit
//     that had not adopted it.
//
//   - The frontend surface a unit screen imports, whose exported client type
//     currently infers foreign types (openapi-fetch) into the published shape.
//     Replacing those with core-owned interfaces changes the exported types.
//
//   - Runtime.Ingest, and its `on UserID` parameter above all. Ingress is
//     OFFERED rather than enforced — a unit lands what it chooses to hand over
//     — and naming the member the record belongs to is a stand-in for a
//     first-class per-member connection concept the tier does not have yet. If
//     one arrives, `on` becomes that connection's identity and every unit's
//     poll changes with it. What will NOT change is the pair of facts behind
//     it: the member has to have deposited a credential with the unit, and the
//     landing runs on their live authority.
//
// A unit written against today's surface will need editing when either lands.
// That is acceptable precisely because the composed set is the trust boundary:
// every unit is first-party or otherwise reviewed, and they migrate together.

//
// It validates first rather than trusting its caller: the result is
// interpolated into SQL identifiers (a migration tracking table, a role
// name), and Validate is the ONE rule saying which byte sequences may get

// not hold:
//
//   - nameGrammar excludes upper case, dots, quotes, spaces and every other

//   - nameGrammar does NOT exclude a leading digit — `1foo` is a legal unit

//     begins `ext_`, so its first byte is never a digit.
//   - The 32-byte cap keeps `schema_migrations_ext_<name>` (18 + 4 + 32 = 54)

	// Tools are the governed agent tools the unit contributes: named
	// operations running at a requested risk tier. Their tiers
	// and scopes are REQUESTS recorded in the manifest for operator
	// resolution — see Tool. Unlike a jurisdiction pack (passive policy),
	// a tool is a governed capability and appears in manifest.generated.json.
	Tools []Tool

	// Channels are the messaging providers this unit supplies TRANSPORT for
	// (ADR-0107/A158). Separate from Ingress because the two are neither
	// implied by nor sufficient for each other: a unit may capture a provider
	// it cannot send on, and the channel declaration is what says which.
	//
	// A channel names a PROVIDER, never an activity kind. The kind a channel
	// message lands under is the core's and is fixed by the contract; letting a
	// unit name one would undo the axis split from outside the core.
	Channels []Channel

	// Secrets are the secret keys the unit declares it will use, by name and
	// scope. Like a Tool's tier these are REQUESTS an operator resolves, not
	// facts: declaring a key mints nothing and reads nothing, and the live
	// port arrives only through the Runtime the core builds per invocation.
	//
	// This does not contradict "a declaration is inert data […] holds no
	// handle into the core" above — a SecretsRequest IS inert data, a name
	// and a scope, which is exactly what lets the generated manifest tell an
	// operator which secrets a unit expects before it ever runs.
	Secrets []SecretsRequest

	// Jobs are the scheduled background jobs the unit contributes: named
	// cadenced passes that fan out over the fleet, one workspace per tick.
	// Like a Tool this carries BEHAVIOR only — the cadence, wall clocks,
	// queue and attempt cap are MECHANICS and live in the unit's
	// api/jobs.yaml fragment, reaching the process as a JobDeclaration.
	//
	// A job is not a tool with a timer, and the difference is who is there
	// when it runs: nobody. That is why the job seam refuses a confirm-first
	// tier outright (a confirmation nobody can ever give) and refuses an
	// outbound scope (autonomous outbound authority on a clock), where the
	// served-tool seam refuses the same two shapes for weaker reasons.
	Jobs []Job

	// Subscriptions are the events the unit reacts to: named listeners over the
	// installation's own event bus, each naming the types it wants and the
	// function one delivery runs.
	//
	// Like a Job this pairs a declaration with behavior, and unlike a Job the
	// declaration is HERE rather than in a contract fragment — there is no HTTP
	// surface, no cadence and no queue to spell, only which facts the unit
	// listens for. That list is derived into manifest.generated.json, so what a
	// unit consumes is visible to an operator without reading its source.
	//
	// A delivery has NOBODY behind it, which is what separates a subscription
	// from a tool: no caller, and so no permissions a core write could be
	// checked against. See EventHandler.
	Subscriptions []Subscription

	// Ingress are the providers this unit brings records IN from, and the
	// record kinds it lands through the core's own capture pipeline.
	//
	// Like a Tool's tier this is a request an operator can see before anything
	// runs — and unlike a tier it is also load-bearing while it runs: the core
	// stamps a landed record's provenance from the System declared here, so a
	// unit never spells its own, and an ingest naming an undeclared source is
	// refused rather than admitted under an invented namespace.
	//
	// Presence is the enablement, as everywhere in this tier. A unit declaring
	// none cannot reach capture at all, which is the state every unit was in
	// before this field existed.
	Ingress []IngressSource

	// Inbound are the session-less HTTP edges this unit asks the core to mount:
	// a signed POST from a party that holds no session and no seat.
	//
	// Like a Tool's tier this is a REQUEST an operator resolves — declaring one
	// mounts nothing an operator has not enabled, and the bounds a unit asks for
	// are clamped by the installation's own ceiling, with the manifest recording
	// what was asked and what was granted.
	//
	// It is declared HERE rather than in a contract fragment because a fragment
	// adds capabilities and never the shape of the document: the merge layer
	// refuses a top-level block of contract structure by argument, which is what
	// an inbound edge is. Ingress and Channels are declared the same way and for
	// the same reason.
	//
	// Presence is the enablement. A unit declaring none has no anonymous edge,
	// which is the state every unit was in before this field existed.
	Inbound []InboundEndpoint

	// Migrations is the unit's SQL schema layer: a read-only filesystem
	// holding the MigrationsDir directory of NNNN_name.up.sql/.down.sql
	// pairs, which a unit supplies with `//go:embed migrations`. A unit
	// that owns no tables leaves it nil, and that is the common case.
	//
	// EMBEDDED, not read back from the source tree, because the process
	// that applies it is a bare binary: the api image ships
	// /usr/local/bin/margince-migrate and no repository, so a
	// path-relative read would apply a unit's migrations in dev and CI —
	// where the checkout is right there — and silently none in
	// production, which is the one place nobody watches a migration
	// count. The declaration carrying its own bytes is what makes the
	// composed binary self-sufficient.
	//
	// Still inert data: an fs.FS is bytes to read, not a handle into the
	// core. Applying them is the migrate role's job (cmd/migrate), after
	// the composed set is known; declaring them mints nothing.
	//
	// WHAT TIES THIS FIELD TO THE GATED SQL, precisely, because the two are
	// separate facts and the join is only as strong as its weakest link.
	// gen-composition requires this field to name a package-level var whose
	// //go:embed directive covers MigrationsDir, and requires the field to be
	// present at all when the unit ships that directory — so the unset field,
	// the typo and the var embedding some other layer are each refused at
	// generation. What is NOT proven is that the bytes reaching cmd/migrate are
	// the bytes extmigrategate applied: an embed directive may cover more than
	// migrations/, and an fs.FS assembled at run time is beyond what a static
	// reader can follow at all. The tier's threat model is a reviewed unit
	// (see Runtime), and under it that residue is the ordinary distance between
	// a shape check and a proof — not a hole a hostile unit is being trusted
	// not to walk through, because such a unit has better roads.
	Migrations fs.FS

	// FailureClasses are the ways this unit's background jobs fail, named in
	// the unit's own vocabulary, each with what an operator does about it.
	//
	// It exists because a job failure reaches a human through river_job.errors,
	// a fleet-wide column every admin reads — so the job layer persists only
	// sentences from a closed vocabulary and substitutes everything else. A unit
	// that declares its classes here gets its own classification into that
	// vocabulary, and its jobs return extension.Failure to speak it.
	//
	// A unit that declares none is not degraded: its failures report exactly
	// what they reported before this field existed.
	//
	// Boot refuses a DECLARED set that is malformed or that collides with the
	// core vocabulary, and it refuses the whole set together rather than
	// mid-tick. It cannot refuse a class a job BUILDS at tick time, because no
	// boot ever saw it: that one is caught on the write path, which publishes a
	// class's sentence only when the installation registered exactly it. An
	// unregistered one falls through to the core vocabulary and reports as
	// unclassified only when nothing there matches either, so forgetting to
	// declare costs the unit's own wording and never a classification the failure
	// would have had anyway. The cause goes to the log in every case.
