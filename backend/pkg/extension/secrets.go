// It is also the answer when the mapping row exists but the custodian no

// core's typed id — an extension would then bind the core's kernel as frozen
// published API. It is a distinct named type rather than a bare string so a
// key and a user cannot be swapped at a call site: PutUser(key, userID, ...)
// does not compile. A value that is not a canonical UUID is refused by the
// implementation, not by this type — validation belongs where the workspace
// membership is checked anyway.

//
// This is inert DATA and not a handle, so it does not contradict the package
// doc's "a declaration holds no handle into the core": the live port is
// Secrets, and a unit only ever gets one from the Runtime the core builds
// for a single invocation. What is declared here is a NAME and a SCOPE,
// which is what lets the generated manifest tell an operator "this unit
// expects a workspace-scoped `signing` key" before the unit ever runs.

// Secrets is the extension's own secret namespace, handed to a unit through
// its Runtime. Keys are the unit's own bare names: the implementation closes
// over the invoking unit and scopes every statement by it, so two units may
// both use the key "signing" and neither can read the other's. There is
// deliberately no method taking a unit name — reaching another namespace is
// not something this port can express.
//
// Nor does anything here expose the custodian's handle for a secret. An
// extension addresses a secret by ITS OWN key name and never sees, stores or
// supplies a vault ref: a ref is a capability, and one that reached extension
// code could be persisted somewhere the core cannot revoke.
//
// The two scopes are independent namespaces. The workspace scope is the
// installation's own credential (an API key the unit calls a provider with);
// the user scope is one member's (their personal token at that provider). A
// unit that only ever needs one of them uses only those three methods.
//
// Every call runs against the workspace the invocation is pinned to. There is
// no cross-workspace read, and no parameter through which one could be asked
// for.
//
// ALL OF THE ABOVE IS A PROPERTY OF THIS PORT, and the port is not the only
// road to the rows. Under the tier's threat model (see Runtime) that is the
// right protection: it makes a unit reaching outside its namespace a thing that
// does not compile, which is what stops the mistake. It is not containment. A
// unit that goes around this port — Runtime.Tx reaches extension_secret on the
// shared application role, and in-process Go can read the keyvault root key
// from the environment and decrypt the ciphertext — is not stopped by anything
// here or anywhere else in the tree. Issue #628 is the first change that would
// narrow the first of those.
