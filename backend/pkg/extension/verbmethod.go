// that mutates tells every cache, crawler, retry and prefetch that replaying it

// that the call changes something — which is a declaration a reviewer trusts and
// a client guards against for no reason.

// POST is the one method with no rule, and that is the model rather than an

// arguments, run this". Every other verb states a semantic the scope can
// contradict, so every other verb is held to it.
