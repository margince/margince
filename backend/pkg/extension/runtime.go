// ErrRuntimeExpired reports that a Runtime outlived the call it was built
// for. The core mints one per invocation over call-scoped resources and
// invalidates it the moment the handler returns, so a handler that stashes
// its Runtime in a package variable and reaches for it on a later call is
// told so, rather than quietly working against released state.
//
// This is a guarantee the CORE keeps, not one this type can make about
// itself: an interface cannot enforce its own lifetime, so what is published
// here is the error a handler must expect, and the invalidation lives in the
// core's per-call adapter.
var ErrRuntimeExpired = errors.New("extension: this runtime belongs to a call that has finished")

// ErrNoRows reports that a single-row read matched nothing. It is what
// Row.Scan returns for an empty result, so the ordinary "is it there?" read
// is an errors.Is check rather than a sentinel the extension has to guess.
var ErrNoRows = errors.New("extension: the query matched no rows")

// Runtime is the capability handle a governed tool is invoked with. It is the
// only way an extension reaches anything the core OFFERS at run time: the
// Extension value a unit's New() returns is inert declaration and holds no
// handle (see the package doc), so no capability this surface publishes is
// reachable without a Runtime the core built for that one call.
//
// WHAT THAT IS NOT. A unit is ordinary Go compiled into the same process, so
// this is a narrow, well-lit door in a building with no walls: a handler can
// import os and read the environment, open its own database connection, reach
// the network, or call into any package it lists in its own go.mod. Nothing
// here prevents that and nothing in this repository does either. The sentence
// above is a statement about the SHAPE OF THE OFFERED SURFACE — what a unit is
// given, and when — not a containment claim.
//
// THE TIER'S THREAT MODEL, said plainly because the rest of this file reads
// like a boundary: the units this tier is built for are REVIEWED, FIRST-PARTY
// OR OTHERWISE TRUSTED code. The composed set IS the trust boundary — the
// vanilla tree ships only first-party units and an installation adds one
// deliberately. Every wall documented here is DEFENCE IN DEPTH AGAINST
// MISTAKES: it makes the query that reaches past a unit's own tables, the
// forgotten scope, the retained handle into a loud failure instead of a silent
// one. None of it is a sandbox against a hostile unit, and running an untrusted
// unit in a composed build is outside what this design supports. Issue #628 (a
// per-unit database role) is the first change that would move any part of this
// from convention to enforcement, and even that bounds only the database.
//
// The core constructs it and knows which unit it is invoking, which is why
// nothing here takes a unit name or re-scopes to one — a handler holds
// exactly the namespace it was invoked under.
//
// Its lifetime is the invocation. It must not be retained: every method on a
// Runtime the core has released answers ErrRuntimeExpired.
//
// Like Extension, Runtime grows ADDITIVELY — a new capability kind is a new
// method — so a HANDLER written against today's surface keeps compiling. A new
// method is still a breaking change for anything that IMPLEMENTS the interface,
// and units' test fakes do; adding one is a downstream coordination, not a free
// move.

	// INVOCATION, not from the ctx passed here: everything else this ctx
	// carries is honoured — a shorter deadline, a cancellation, the values a
	// handler put on it — but the workspace comes from the call the Runtime
	// was minted for, so a handler cannot name a different one by building a
	// context. What bounds the SQL inside is convention plus a static scan of
	// the unit's own source (extensionsqlscope_test.go), not a policy or a
	// grant; see Tx for what that leaves unwalled.
	//
	// fn returning an error rolls the transaction back; returning nil
	// commits it. The Tx handed to fn is valid only for that call — it is

	// is one every caller can forge.

	// It answers from state the core already holds, so it costs no query and
	// cannot fail. Everything it does NOT carry is deliberate: a display name,

	// Ingest hands ONE record the unit pulled from its provider to the

	// produced it.
	//
	// What the core does with it is everything a captured mail gets: the write
	// is idempotent on the record's natural key, the counterparty goes through
	// the same disposition ladder, the provider's original is kept as evidence,
	// and the audit row and the outbox event commit with the row. A unit
	// therefore does not — and cannot — assemble a timeline entry itself.
	//
	// IT IS NOT TRANSACTIONAL WITH ANYTHING THE UNIT IS DOING. The pipeline
	// opens its own transaction, so this must be called with none of the unit's
	// held (Tx nesting answers ErrNestedIngest rather than hanging), and a
	// unit's bookkeeping about what it has ingested is a separate commit.
	//
	// THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS, and the one worth getting right: advance your
	// cursor only AFTER Ingest returns, and only past records it has answered
	// for. The asymmetry is what makes that safe — a cursor not advanced past a
	// record that landed costs one deduplicated retry, because the natural key
	// makes a replay a no-op, while a cursor advanced past a record that did
	// not land costs the record permanently.
	//

	// wholly-internal message deliberately and commits a breadcrumb saying so,

	// onward.

// Tx is a database transaction on the installation's workspace, and the whole

// It deliberately does NOT mirror a driver's API. Batching, copy protocols,
// savepoints, listen/notify and connection-level state are all absent
// because none of them can be handed to extension code without also handing
// over things the core must keep (the connection's lifetime, its GUCs, its
// prepared-statement cache).
//
// The SQL is the extension's own, and nothing here parses or rewrites it: a
// wall made of statement inspection is a wall made of guesses. The wall is the
// DATABASE's, and this is where the tier's threat model (see Runtime) has to be
// stated concretely, because the honest answer differs by reader.
//
// THERE IS NO TENANT WALL HERE, and the honest reason is that there is nothing
// left for one to separate. An installation holds exactly one workspace —
// identity.Service.InstallationWorkspace refuses a second rather than choosing
// between them — so no table in this database carries workspace_id and no
// row-level-security policy exists, in core or in the tier. What bounds a unit's
// SQL is what its own migrations created and the grants they carry, and
// extmigrategate refuses a unit table that declares the column or a policy over
// it. If the product ever becomes multi-tenant the column returns to CORE first
// and the tier follows it, in that order.
//
// WHAT IS NOT WALLED, therefore:
//   - the CORE's tables. This runs on the shared application role, so a unit's
//     SQL can address any table that role can.
//   - OTHER UNITS' tables. Every unit's migration grants the same application
//     role DML on its own ext_<name>_* tables, so unit A can read, rewrite or
//     delete unit B's rows.
//   - extension_secret. The wall around it is structural in Go — every read and
//     write goes through platform/extsecrets, which closes over the invoking
//     unit's namespace — so the namespacing Secrets enforces at the PORT is
//     reachable around it through these three verbs. And because a unit runs
//     in-process it can also read the keyvault root key from the environment and
//     decrypt the ciphertext directly. "Sovereign inside its namespace,
//     powerless outside it" is a property of polite units, not of this
//     transaction.
//
// All three are the same missing thing — a per-unit database ROLE, which would
// bound a unit by grant rather than by convention, tracked as issue #628 — and
// all three are inside the trusted-unit threat model above. Read that issue as
// grant containment on its own argument; the tenant isolation it was once also
// expected to carry is not a property this schema has to lose. A static gate does
// refuse the first two where it can SEE them —
// backend/gates/extensionsqlscope_test.go reads the SQL a unit's source spells
// out and holds it to that unit's own ext_<name>_* tables — but a scanner is
// defence against mistakes by construction: it reads text, and this seam takes
// whatever string a unit assembles.
//
// args is ...any because SQL arguments are genuinely heterogeneous — a
// statement's parameters are whatever its placeholders are — and every
// database/sql-shaped API in the ecosystem, the pgx this is implemented over
// included, spells them the same way. AGENTS.md's no-`any` rule is aimed at
// TypeScript's escape hatches; a Go query-argument list is not one.
