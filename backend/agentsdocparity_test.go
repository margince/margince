// CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are deliberately different documents: CLAUDE.md is
// the long form, AGENTS.md the digest other agent harnesses read. Most sections
// differ on purpose and must not be synced.
//
// Four sections are the exception. They state binding invariants — the write
// shape, the reuse rule, the license header, and the rules the review loop
// produced — and both files carry them in full because both are read in
// isolation: CLAUDE.md by Claude Code, AGENTS.md by `cli/craft`, which feeds
// the whole nearest AGENTS.md into the gate prompt. A pointer in one of them
// would leave whoever reads the other without the rule.
//
// Full copies in two files drift. This asserts they have not: the four
// sections must be byte-identical, so changing an invariant in one file fails
// here until it is changed in both.
