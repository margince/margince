// A connector that POSTPONES a tick on an unreachable provider asks to run again
// after a fixed delay, and that delay has to EQUAL the cadence its dispatcher
// already ticks at — and has to survive the seam's ceiling on the way to the
// queue.
//
// WHY THE EQUALITY IS LOAD-BEARING, and not a tidiness preference: a postponed
// child sits in `scheduled`, one of the states the fan-out's uniqueness window
// covers, so while it waits the dispatcher's next insert for that workspace
// collapses into it — the postponement REPLACES the tick it would have raced.
// That is the whole argument that an outage changes what a tick reports rather
// than how often it runs. Widen a unit's cadence to 600s and leave its delay at
// 120s and the argument quietly inverts: the snoozed row fires five times before
// the dispatcher would have run again, so the connector polls a refusing provider
// HARDER during an outage than it does in health. Nothing about either file would
// look wrong.
//
// THE CEILING IS PART OF THE SAME OBLIGATION, and leaving it out left the gate
// green over the exact inversion it exists to catch: jobs.rescheduleFor clamps to
// maxRescheduleDelay, so a unit declaring a 30-minute cadence and a matching
// 30-minute delay reconciles perfectly and then snoozes for fifteen — polling a
// refusing provider twice as hard during an outage as in health. The bound is read
// out of the seam's own source rather than trusted from a comment saying it "sits
// well above any cadence a connector declares", which was a claim about today's
// tree that nothing enforced.
//
// It lives HERE, at the root, rather than as a copy in each unit's own suite,
// because the obligation belongs to the tier and not to a unit. And the unit list
// is derived from who actually POSTPONES — a file calling extension.Reschedule —
// rather than from a filename, so a unit that moves the concept somewhere else, or
// a third connector written next year, is covered without anybody remembering a
// test exists. A unit that classifies but never postpones has nothing to
// reconcile and is correctly absent.
