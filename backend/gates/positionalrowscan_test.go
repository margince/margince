// A positional row mapping may only target a struct its own package declares.
//
// `pgx.RowToStructByPos[T]` binds a SELECT's column ORDER to T's field order, so
// the query and the struct have to be edited together. That is fine — and is why
// the pattern is used here — as long as one package owns both. It stops being
// fine the moment T belongs to somebody else: privacy read the custom-field
// catalogue as RowToStructByPos[fieldcatalog.Column] with a two-column SELECT,
// and the day that PORT gained a third field for a different module's read,
// privacy's erasure and its Art. 15 export both began failing on a mismatch
// neither file mentions. Nothing in either module changed.
//
// Only the integration lane could see it, because the mismatch is a pgx runtime
// error rather than a compile error, which is what makes it worth a gate: the
// unit suites, the type checker and the linters were all green.
//
// Derived rather than listed: the rule is read off every call in the tree, so a
// new one is enrolled by existing (review-loop rule 2). The fix at any site is to
// scan into named fields, which also documents which columns that query needs.
