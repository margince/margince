// Every River job declares its role, and the declaration is the contract:
// a job either does tenant work for ONE workspace (jobs.WorkspaceScoped,
// method WorkspaceID) or only scans and enqueues (jobs.FleetWide). A job
// that declares neither is the shape this gate exists to prevent — an
// inline `for each workspace` loop inside one job row, whose per-workspace
// failures have nowhere durable to land, so River records success while
// tenants silently failed.
//
// api/jobs.yaml states that role per kind and jobkinds_gen.go turns each
// statement into a compile-time assertion, so the role of a DECLARED kind is
// the compiler's to check. What is left here is the two halves those generated
// assertions provably cannot reach — a type the contract has never heard of,
// and a type that answers to both roles at once.

// unit — and the closed union's members are bare identifiers in package
// compose, which an extension module cannot be. So these two types carry their
// kind in a FIELD, one pair serving every composed job.
//
// What replaces the guarantee this gate gives every other type is not nothing,
// and it is not weaker at the point that matters. The union stops an undeclared
// kind at COMPILE time; for these two it is stopped at BOOT, by the same
// jobs.MustBeTotal the runner already refuses on — RegisterExtensions declares
// the composed kinds through jobs.RegisterComposed before NewJobRunner runs, so
// a kind with no declaration still cannot reach River's one-minute default. It
// aborts the boot instead of failing the build.
