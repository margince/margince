// Every AI task this build can run reports into the AI-activity projection.
//
// The rail's claim is that it says what the AI is doing for one person. A task
// that reports nothing is AI work the product performed and then denied — and
// for seventeen of nineteen shipped tasks that was the state of the tree, with
// every gate green. The gates in place could not see it: they compared the
// contract's kind enum against the two producers already wired, which is a
// question whose answer can never be an absentee.
//
// So this gate asks the other question. It starts from the CONTRACT's task
// table — the one place a new AI task must be declared — and requires each task
// to name the source that reports it. Derived from the generated table rather
// than a list here, because a list is exactly what went stale to produce the
// defect.
//
// It lives at the root because no module can ask it: `ai` owns the task
// vocabulary, the carriers are its siblings, and a module never imports one.
