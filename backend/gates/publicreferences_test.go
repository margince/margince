// This repository is public. Everything in it is readable by anyone, which
// makes a reference to a private repository, document or pull request two
// distinct failures at once: it leaks internal structure, and it sends a
// contributor somewhere they cannot go to satisfy a rule that then blocks
// their push.
//
// The rule is therefore absolute rather than a matter of taste: if a rule
// matters, it is written out here. A citation is by decision number, and the
// number is a label, not a pointer: the record it names is not in this tree.
//
// This derives the file list from git rather than walking the filesystem, so
// an untracked scratch file is out of scope and a newly tracked one is in it
// automatically. There is no exemption list: the one file that could not be
// cleaned was moved out of this repository instead, and an exemption is a hole
// somebody eventually widens.
