// that shows the value without consulting the ledger shows the reader the exact
// claim they already overrode — so consulting it cannot be one caller's job.
//
// person360's readProfileFields overlays the verdict and its comment says it is
// every read that renders the table. That was a claim with nothing holding it,
// which is the shape this repo's own rulebook forbids: "a comment may not claim
// to be the only implementation unless a test holds it", and every such claim
// audited in this tree had turned out false. This is the test.
//
// It judges READS that serve values, so an existence probe and a merge relink
// are not subjects: neither hands a stored value to anybody, and asking them to
// consult a verdict ledger would be asking the wrong question.

// only asks whether a row exists or moves it. `SELECT 1 … EXISTS` and a
// `DELETE`/`UPDATE … SET person_id` touch the table without ever putting a
// machine's claim in front of a reader.
//
// The value column may sit ANYWHERE in the projection, so the match spans from
// SELECT to FROM rather than anchoring on the first column. Anchoring on the
// first is how it was written and it was wrong in the direction that matters:
// `SELECT ppf.person_id, ppf.value FROM person_profile_field` serves the value
// and would have escaped the census entirely, leaving this gate green over the
// defect it exists to name. It only passed at all because sar.go happens to
// list `field` first.
//
// `field` is deliberately NOT one of the value words. It is the column that
// says WHICH assertion a row is about, so it appears in the WHERE of every
// existence probe on this table — including one nested inside an unrelated
// query, which is how the candidate sweep in enrichsignature.go came to look
// like a value reader. The words below are the assertion ITSELF and its
// evidence, which is what a verdict can overturn.
//
// A STAR projection is a value serve too, and it names none of those words.
// `SELECT *` and `SELECT ppf.*` are matched separately for that reason: a
// census that misses them misses them SILENTLY, which is the one direction
// this gate must not fail in.
//
// The residue, and it fails the safe way: the words are matched between a
// SELECT and a later FROM within a statement that names this table, so a
// `value` column belonging to a DIFFERENT table in the same statement matches
// too. That is a false POSITIVE — it surfaces as a reader that must be
// overlaid or ratified, never as silence — and a wrong waiver is visible in
// review where a missed reader is not.
// valueColumns are the columns that carry the assertion itself or the evidence
// for it — the things a human verdict can overturn.
//
// A list rather than words spelled inside the pattern, so the defect test can
// COMPARE it against a set of words that test writes out for itself. The test
// deliberately does not iterate this list to build its cases: a case derived
// from the same list the pattern is built from disappears when a word does, and
// proves nothing about that word. The comparison is what holds both directions
// — a word dropped here fails, and a word added here fails until the test names
// it too.

It serves nobody: the values move between two records and are read back through person360 afterwards like any other, verdict and all. Overlaying here would write the OVERLAID value into the survivor's row and destroy the distinction between what the machine asserted and what a human decided about it — the copy must be faithful precisely because the ledger is consulted later. The cost is that a verdict keyed to the merged-away person's id does not follow its value across, which is a gap in the merge rather than in this reader",
	"internal/modules/people/orgnamepromotion.go": "RATIFIED PENDING A DECISION, see issue #2319. The corroborated org-name promotion reads the org_name signature values to count how many people at an organization state the same employer name. It does not show them as fact — it ranks a claim and, when signatures alone are the only agreement, stages a 🟡 proposal for a human. But it does not consult the ledger either, so an org_name a human already REJECTED still corroborates. Whether a verdict about one person's signature should veto a rename of their employer is a product question with an argument on each side, which is why it is filed rather than decided here. The cost, stated plainly: until that is answered, a rejected claim carries weight it may not deserve",
	"internal/modules/people/observedcontact.go":  "seedFromColumn serves the value to NOBODY. It reads one field's sidecar row and compares it to the person COLUMN beside it, answering a question about provenance rather than about content: does the column hold something this table never wrote — a title somebody typed by hand — which is therefore about to be replaced with no record of what it was. The answer decides only what goes into the undo buffer. Overlaying a verdict would make the comparison WRONG rather than safer: the overlaid value is what a human said, the column is what the record carries, and a match between them would then read as 'the sidecar accounts for this column' in exactly the case where the two disagree and the typed value is the one about to be lost. The cost is that this file must be re-examined if it ever grows a read that reaches a reader",
	"internal/modules/privacy/sarsections.go":     "the Article 15 export owes the subject what this installation HOLDS, and it holds two facts: the value the machine asserted and the verdict the human recorded against it. It exports the stored columns here and ai_feedback as its own section beside them, so the subject sees both. Overlaying the verdict instead would hand them one merged value and conceal that an override exists — the opposite of what an export is for. It also cannot share person360's reader: privacy is a module and may not import compose (ADR-0054 §3). The cost is that the two statements must be corrected together when the column set changes, which is why they name each other at both sites",
