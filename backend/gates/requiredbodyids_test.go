// Every contract request body that declares a required id must be accounted for.
//
// The defect behind this gate: oapi-codegen renders a REQUIRED body id as a
// non-pointer openapi_types.UUID, and encoding/json leaves an absent key at the
// zero value with no error. Nothing downstream distinguishes "the caller named
// this record" from "the caller named nothing" — so the zero UUID reaches a
// lookup or a link-target check, matches no row, and the caller is told a record
// it never mentioned does not exist. `create_record` for a deal and a project
// were unusable for exactly that reason.
//
// The obligation is derived from the generated contract, not from a list of the
// bodies someone remembered: the walk finds every request body with such a field
// and requires each to be either PROBED (a mapping refuses it by name, proved in
// the owning module's test) or WAIVED with a reason. A new required id upstream
// fails here until someone decides which it is, and a waiver that stops being
// true fails too — so the list of unguarded bodies can only shrink.
//
// Where the guard goes: httperr.RequireBodyID is the one implementation, called
// from the point where the decoded body becomes store input — a mapping where the
// module has one (deals), the store entry point where it does not, because that is
// the door every transport comes through. Never in the HTTP handler alone, which
// is what left the MCP twin and the REST route answering differently.
