// A FleetWide declaration is a promise: this job enumerates and enqueues, and
// does no tenant write of its own (jobs.FleetWide). jobrole_test.go proves every
// job DECLARES a role; this gate proves the FleetWide half of that declaration
// is true of the code. Without it a pass could keep the marker, keep its null
// `args->>'workspace_id'`, and quietly do a tenant's work inside one row again —
// the shape whose per-workspace failures have nowhere durable to land.
//
// # The allowlist
//
// "Reaches an insert" is interprocedural — a dispatch travels through package
// helpers, injected inserters and store transactions — so it is not honestly
// AST-checkable, and a gate that pretended otherwise would be lying about what
// it verified. This one is a CLOSED ALLOWLIST instead: a dispatcher's Work must
// contain a call to one of compose's three fan-out helpers —
// dispatchPerWorkspace, dispatchWith or dispatchOne.
//
// The set is the whole allowlist, and a direct River Insert is deliberately
// NOT in it. Those three are where a fan-out child's insert options are built,
// which is where the sweep tag is stamped and where the child's declared queue
// and attempt cap are read; a dispatcher that inserts around them enqueues a
// child that is invisible to both sweep gauges and carries whatever numbers
// its author typed. That is not hypothetical — it is what shipped, in the one
// dispatcher a hand-maintained comment forgot to list. A fourth spelling is a
// finding on purpose: adding one is then a deliberate act with a reviewer
// attached.
//
// # Which arm carries the weight
//
// The FAN-OUT requirement is the load-bearing one. The regression this phase
// exists to prevent is a worker that loops the fleet and calls a store method
// per tenant — the pre-conversion shape — and that worker calls none of the
// spellings above, so it fails here and nowhere else. jobbinding_test.go does
// not look at writes at all (it catches a Work body binding its own workspace),
// and the RLS lane catches only UNBOUND writes, while a fleet loop that binds
// the GUC per workspace and then writes satisfies RLS completely. Nothing
// downstream covers that shape.
//
// # The one kind that owns no tenant and still does the work
//
// A FleetWide declaration says the job owns no tenant. Until ADR-0091 §8 that
// implied a fan-out, because the work itself always belonged to some workspace.
// It no longer does for a corpus phase D un-scoped: there is ONE corpus, so the
// pass that rebuilds it is neither a workspace's job nor a dispatcher, and the
// children it used to enqueue all walked the same rows. Such a kind is named in
// fleetWideDoesItsOwnPass with the reason, and only the fan-out arm is waived —
// it is still held to the no-tenant-write arm below, which is the arm that
// matters once a job does the work in its own row.
//
// # Reads are fine; writes are not
//
// Several sanctioned dispatchers READ tenant tables — the due-scans that find
// which connections, builds or workspaces have work — and jobs.FleetWide
// expressly permits that. So the second arm prohibits WRITES, scoped to what is
// honestly visible: a SQL write STATEMENT in the dispatcher's own body or in a
// helper method on the same worker type that its Work calls. No dispatcher in
// the tree writes inline today, so this arm has no live subject; it is here so
// that the first inline write is a finding rather than a precedent.
