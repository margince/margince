// Review-loop rule 3 as a fitness function over the compose tier: anything
// that returns a record is a read, so a query that hands back a REFERENCE to a
// row-scoped record applies that record's row scope.
//
// The class this closes is the reference held across time. A read model, a link
// row and a graph edge all store somebody else's record id, and the scope was
// checked when the id was WRITTEN — by which point the deal can be reassigned,
// the person merged, the org's owner moved teams. The read that hands the id
// back inherits nothing from that write, and the failure is quiet: the caller
// gets a well-formed answer naming a record whose own read path refuses them.
//
// Why the compose tier is the frame. A module never imports a sibling, so a
// cross-module read model assembled here has no sibling store's gate in front
// of it — compose is where these references are joined and served.
// rbacgate_test.go holds internal/modules' store entry points and says in its
// own header that it pins the OBJECT half, "row-scope composition itself stays
// a call-site obligation"; its entryPointsOutsideModules set then ratifies the
// compose read services as subjects it has deliberately not judged. This gate
// is that judgement, for the half rbacgate leaves open. Extending it over
// internal/modules is a separate change with its own evidence — that tier holds
// several times as many statements of this shape, and a store that owns its
// table is a different question from a read model pointing at someone else's.
//
// What the gate asks, in three derived steps:
//
//   - the row-scoped VOCABULARY is read out of platform/auth's own
//     ownerScopedTables, so a table that becomes row-scoped widens this census
//     without anyone remembering to;
//   - the SITES are every SQL select list in the tier naming a `<table>_id`
//     column for one of those tables, resolved out of the string literals
//     themselves — a new read model inherits the obligation — minus the reads
//     that only re-key ids the caller passed IN (boundToCallerArgument);
//   - the OBLIGATION is that the enclosing function transitively reaches a
//     row-scope spelling. Object admission (auth.Require) deliberately does not
//     count: both halves of #632 passed auth.Require(ctx, "deal", ActionRead)
//     and served a deal the caller could not open, so a gate that accepted it
//     would have read green over the defect it was written for.
