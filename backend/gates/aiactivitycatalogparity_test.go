// The AI-activity contract must name exactly the work that can reach it, and
// cap exactly what the read caps.
//
// Both halves were held by a gate inside the package the read used to live in.
// That package is gone, and the obligations are not: a spec whose name the
// contract does not carry announces a kind the wire cannot express and the rail
// renders NOTHING for it — silently, with the agent really running. Restored
// here because the root is the only place that can see the catalog, the
// contract and the read's own bounds at once.
