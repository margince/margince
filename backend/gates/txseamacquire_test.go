package gates

// Code that runs on a caller's `pgx.Tx` acquires no connection of its own.
//
// The C5 shared-tx seams exist so a caller can commit a sibling module's write
// and its own in ONE transaction. A seam that reaches for the pool while
// standing inside someone else's transaction breaks that in two ways, and
// neither announces itself. The second connection commits separately, so the
// "both or neither" claim the shape is chosen for is quietly false. And if the
// caller's transaction holds a lock the second one waits on, the two block each
// other inside a single goroutine — a deadlock Postgres cannot detect and will
// not break, because it sees two unrelated sessions waiting.
//
// The rule is not new; it is written on the acquirer that breaks it most often.
// The custom-field catalog read documents "callers fetch BEFORE opening their
// write/read transaction (never inside it — a nested pool acquire under load is
// a deadlock shape)". Deriving the obligation from the tree is what makes a
// seam written next month inherit it instead of re-deciding it.
//
// Two things bound what this can prove, and both are why the pool-of-one suite
// in compose/integration exists beside it: the gate catches the class across
// the diff, that suite catches the instance in a database.
//
//   - The acquirers are NAMED rather than inferred, because "does this call
//     reach the pool" is not decidable from syntax. They are the spellings this
//     tree has: the pool itself, the transaction openers (database.DB.Tx, the
//     modules' `s.tx` helper over it, database.With*Tx, a raw Begin), and the
//     field-catalog read, which opens a transaction of its own two calls down.
//     A new spelling would slip past until it is added here.
//   - A call reaches the pool through a package-local helper rather than
//     directly, and the walk does not follow it.
