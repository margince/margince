// One Go version, pinned in several places, and they have to agree.
//
// The pins exist for different readers: go.mod is what the compiler and CI
// resolve (every workflow job uses `go-version-file: backend/go.mod`),
// .tool-versions is what a developer's asdf/mise shell installs, and the
// extension how-to is what somebody copies when they start a new unit. Nothing
// made them move together, so a security bump updated the modules and left the
// developer pin a patch release behind — which is how a machine keeps building
// with the vulnerable toolchain the bump was for.
//
// This derives the answer from backend/go.mod rather than holding a list: the
// product module is the pin CI actually reads, so it is the one that decides.
