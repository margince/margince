// Every workflow job carries a wall-clock ceiling.
//
// A job with no `timeout-minutes` inherits GitHub's default of SIX HOURS. That
// is not a bound, it is an outage: a required check that hangs holds the merge
// for a working day, and while it hangs it is indistinguishable from a queue
// backlog — so it is not even read as a failure while it does the damage.
//
// The case that motivated this: a stalled dependency download in the `uat` job
// sat in_progress for 2h20m against a lane that normally finishes in five
// minutes, and had to be cancelled by hand (#1836). Nothing in the product was
// wrong; nothing reported anything.
//
// Derived from the workflow tree rather than a list of job names, so a job
// added later is covered the day it is committed — which is the whole reason
// this is a fitness test and not a one-time edit. It lives beside the other
// gates that read ci.yml (laneconnbudget, frontendlaneparity,
// contractfrontendlane) rather than as a script in a fourth language.
