// Fitness function over a guarantee this codebase no longer has.
//
// No table in any schema carries row-level security, and no policy exists to
// read. What a statement reaches is bounded by the predicate it writes for
// itself and by the row-scope clauses in platform/auth — so a source comment
// saying RLS scopes, bounds, confines or gates a read names a control the
// database does not apply, and the next reader trusts it instead of checking.
// Nineteen statements whose scope had been the DATABASE's were found the hard
// way, two of them data loss and one a cross-tenant disclosure; every one was
// found by a failing test, because nothing gates the class. This is the cheap
// half of that gate: it cannot tell whether a query is scoped, but it can stop
// the tree from claiming a retired mechanism scopes it.
//
// It bans the CLAIM, not the word. Three spellings stay legal because they
// name something real: the `// rls-exempt:` waiver marker that
// scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh reads, the BYPASSRLS/NOBYPASSRLS role
// attributes (a live cluster property AssertRuntimeRole still refuses), and
// prose that names the retirement itself.

// The suffix group carries `d` as well as `ed` because the stems are whole
// words: "scoped" is scope+d, not scope+ed. Leaving it out is what the pinning
// test below caught — the gate had swept the tree clean of `RLS-scoped` while
