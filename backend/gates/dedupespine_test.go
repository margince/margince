// Duplicate people, organizations and leads do not get in through the
// matching engine — that engine (PO-F-1/PO-F-2 in
// internal/modules/people/dedupe.go) is good. They get in through a NEW create
// path that forgets to ask it, or asks it with half the inputs. Every real
// duplicate found in a live workspace so far arrived exactly that way: capture
// asked PO-F-2 about a domain and never about a name; cold start asked nothing
// at all; lead promotion probed one column by hand.
//
// A code review cannot hold that line, because the offending change always
// looks locally reasonable. These tests hold it instead: they derive the set of
// INSERT sites from the tree, so a new one has to be argued for here, in a file
// whose whole subject is why the list is short.
