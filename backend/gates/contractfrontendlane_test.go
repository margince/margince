// A contract change owes three regenerations, and the one that strands the
// FRONTEND types is enforced in two different places for two different readers.
//
// Locally it is scripts/check-contract-frontend-drift.sh, wired into
// check-backend, because a backend-only author has no reason to run the lane
// that would otherwise catch it — that is #1639.
//
// On a pull request it is CI's fe-quality job, which runs `make fe-drift`. That
// only holds while the change classifier still ROUTES a contract change to the
// frontend lane: `backend/api/**` sits in the `frontend` filter for exactly this
// reason, and a PR touching only the contract is classified frontend-affecting
// because of that one line. Delete it and the frontend jobs skip, fe-drift never
// runs, and a stranded schema reaches main — which is #1573, the outage this
// whole family is about.
//
// Nothing else notices that deletion. The classifier is a data file, the jobs it
// gates report "skipped" rather than "failed", and a skipped job reads green on
// the pull request. So the routing is asserted here, from the workflow itself.
//
// This is the CI half of the same obligation, and it is deliberately NOT spelled
// as "the backend lane must have pnpm". It must not: deterministic-gates installs
// Go and nothing else, and the local leg skips there — loudly — precisely because
// this test covers the pull-request path instead.

fe-quality is where CI runs `+"`make fe-drift`"+`, the leg that regenerates
frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts from the contract and fails when the committed copy
drifted. With the routing gone that leg never runs, the jobs report SKIPPED, and
skipped reads green — which is how a stranded schema reached main in #1573.
