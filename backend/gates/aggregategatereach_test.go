// Every job the `ci` aggregate depends on can actually RUN on the merge queue.
//
// `ci` is the single required status check, and scripts/ci-verdict.sh refuses any
// result other than `success` on `merge_group` — because GitHub counts a skipped
// required check as a passing one, which is how a lane that ran nothing reported
// green. The cost of that strictness is a coupling that is easy to break from the
// other side: a job whose `if:` requires `github.event_name == 'pull_request'` is
// SKIPPED on the queue, the aggregate refuses the skip, and every queue entry
// fails. The symptom is not a red test — it is merging stopping repository-wide,
// with the cause several files away from the edit that caused it.
//
// This is a fitness test rather than a fixed list because the mistake has already
// been made twice in one change: two lanes were both pull_request-only, and
// finding the second by hand after fixing the first is exactly the "fixed the
// case under review, missed the sibling copy" pattern the engineering rules
// name. Deriving the obligation from the workflow means the third one fails here
// instead of in production.
//
// WHAT THIS CATCHES: a job in the aggregate's `needs:` whose condition cannot be
// satisfied on `merge_group`.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, deliberately: whether a reachable job is CORRECTLY
// scoped there. Judging that means evaluating GitHub's expression language
// against a synthetic event payload, which is a second implementation of the
// thing under test. The failure this guards is total (nothing merges); the one it
// does not is a design question a reviewer can see.
