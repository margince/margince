// The SQL-scope gate's own test, driven with SYNTHETIC unit sources rather than
// the tree — the real units are supposed to pass, so a gate proven only by
// "extensions/ is currently clean" is one that keeps passing after it stops
// working. A fixture unit could not carry these either: a fixture naming a core
// table would have to fail the gate to prove anything.
//
// The gate has a second way to read green that a clean tree hides completely:
// seeing no SQL at all. Every case therefore pins how many table references were
// READ alongside the verdict, and each rule below was checked by breaking it —
// the case is here because the gate without that rule fails it.
