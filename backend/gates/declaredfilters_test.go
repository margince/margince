// A declared narrowing parameter is read by the handler it is declared on, or
// it is not declared.
//
// The defect this closes is the widest wrong answer there is. `GET
// /v1/people?tag=vip` whose handler never reads `tag` returns EVERY person the
// caller may see, with 200 OK and a well-formed page: the client cannot tell
// that from a workspace where everyone carries the tag. Three of these were
// live when the gate was written — `tag`, `organization.domain`,
// `activity.assignee_id` — plus one shadow, `deal.project_id`, that answered
// the whole incumbent mirror to a caller who named one project.
//
// It is derived rather than listed. The generated contract carries every list
// operation's query parameters as a `*Params` struct, so the census IS the
// contract: a parameter added upstream lands here as a failure until a handler
// reads it. That is the half a hand-maintained list cannot do, and the half
// that matters — every one of these defects was a parameter someone declared
// and nobody came back for.
//
// Two obligations, because a request in overlay mode meets two handlers:
//
//   - the NATIVE one must READ the dial (or hand the whole params value on to
//     something that does, or own the raw query string itself — the report
//     handlers parse it wholesale);
//   - the overlay SHADOW must name the dial in the branch that reads the
//     mirror: forward it, or refuse it with the 422 that says the mirror cannot
//     answer this. Delegating to the native handler is the OTHER branch, so a
//     reference inside that closure proves nothing about the mirror path. This
//     is the fitness function #579 asks for, and `occurred_from`/`occurred_to`
//     — forwarded by neither and refused by neither, so a whole mirrored
//     timeline came back as though it were the requested day — is the failure
//     it is derived from.
//
// READ, precisely — not "correctly bound". This walk proves a handler NAMES
// the parameter; it cannot prove the value then narrows the query, and a
// handler that mapped `tag` onto the wrong field would satisfy it. That is
// the honest limit of a static census and it is stated rather than papered
// over, because the pair is what covers the class: this gate is the half no
// test can be written for in advance — the parameter nobody came back for —
// and declaredfilters_http_integration_test.go is the half that proves the
// named ones actually narrow, over HTTP, against records created over HTTP.
// A new parameter therefore arrives with the census already failing, and its
// wire arm is what closes the finding.
//
// Paging and ordering are deliberately OUT of scope: `cursor`, `limit` and
// `sort` are the shared components a page's SHAPE is spelled with, not its
// membership, and a handler that ignores one answers a differently-shaped page
// rather than a different question. Six operations ignore one of the three
// today; that is its own obligation with its own fix, filed separately.
