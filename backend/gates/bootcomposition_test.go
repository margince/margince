// The fitness gate on the boot sequence: a process role that composes
// extensions also records what it composed.
//
// It is derived rather than listed. Naming cmd/api and cmd/worker here would
// leave the next role to be remembered, and the whole failure this guards is a
// role that quietly does not do something — nothing in a boot log says a
// transport went unregistered. Asking "which roles register extensions" of the
// tree means a new one arrives already covered.

// declares what this binary composed; RecordComposition is what writes the
// consequences down — the extension inventory, and the channel vocabulary those
// units declare. A role with the first and not the second boots with units
// installed and their transports unregistered, which is the state a captured
// message on such a transport fails on, several layers away from the cause.
