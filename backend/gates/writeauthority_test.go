package gates

// The read/write asymmetry of a manual record grant, as a fitness function:
// a path that CHANGES a shareable record probes for write authority, not for
// visibility.
//
// The class this closes is one column that nothing read. record_grant.access
// has always carried two levels and the schema has always said "write satisfies
// read", but the only consumer was the visibility arm in platform/auth, which
// matches any live grant by design — correctly, since a `read` share must let
// its holder open the record. Every mutation then gated on that same arm, so a
// `read` share was a licence to write, silently, while the sharing screen told
// the user it was not. It was not one call site: it was thirty-odd, in nine
// modules, each of them individually defensible.
//
// What the gate asks, in three derived steps:
//
//   - the VOCABULARY is platform/auth's own shareableTables — the closed set a
//     grant can name, and therefore the only tables where the two authorities
//     can differ at all. A table that becomes shareable widens this census
//     without anyone remembering to; a table that never was (a list, a saved
//     view) is out of scope because its visibility already IS its write
//     authority.
//   - the SITES are every row probe in internal/modules naming one of those
//     tables, from inside a function that MUTATES: it reaches the storekit write
//     shape, or it sits under an entry point that took auth.Require(update|
//     delete) on anything at all. Both are read out of the tree, so a new store
//     inherits the obligation.
//   - the OBLIGATION is that the probe is one of the write-authority spellings.
//     Object admission does not count and is not consulted: every site this gate
//     was written for already held auth.Require(…, ActionUpdate) and mutated on
//     a `read` share anyway — a gate that accepted it would read green over the
//     defect it exists for.
//
// One probe family is deliberately outside the census, and the absence is not
// an oversight: auth.EnsureLinkTarget. It asks whether the caller may REFERENCE
// a record — attach an activity, name a parent org, add a list member — and
// whether "add" needs write authority on the thing added TO is a product
// question UC-E11-08 E2 raises rather than settles PER CALL SITE — a security
// sweep is the wrong place to answer it for all of them at once, and members.go
// (collections) is the worked counterexample: list membership is not rendered
// as an attribute of the added record, so EnsureLinkTarget is the right gate
// there, not a gap.
//
// One instance IS decided: applying a tag DOES need write authority on the
// target (a tag steers a filter and an automation, so tagging changes the
// record), fixed by moving ApplyTag/RemoveTag/EnsureTaggable in
// internal/modules/collections/tags.go onto EnsureWritableLive — which is why
// tags.go earns no waiver here, having left the excluded spelling behind
// entirely. Every other EnsureLinkTarget site still carries the unresolved
// question and this exclusion still hides it from the census by construction;
// closing that per-site, or ruling the current behavior acceptable and saying
// so here instead of "tracked as its own issue", is tracked separately.
//
// The LIST predicates (auth.ScopeClauseFor, auth.VisiblePredicate) are IN the
// census, and that is a correction rather than a flourish. A first draft left
// them out on the reasoning that a mutation's row gate is a single-row probe
// and the write-path sites holding one are conflict reads about a rival row.
// Review found the counterexample inside this gate's own tier: the contracts
// module owns no owner_id, derives its whole row scope from its anchor through
// a rendered clause, and used that ONE clause as the gate in front of every
// patch, archive, status change, cancellation and renewal — so the list
// predicate WAS the mutation's row gate, and the exclusion read green over it.
//
// The tier is internal/modules, for the reason composerowscope_test.go gives
// for choosing the opposite one: a module store owns its table and is the last
// line in front of the write, which is a different question from a compose read
// model pointing at somebody else's record. Bringing compose under this gate is
// its own change with its own evidence.
//
// Exceptions are explicit, keyed by "package-dir:FuncName", each with the
// rationale that ratified it; a reasonless or stale waiver fails.
