// A credential reaches a log field only on the failure of the channel that was
// supposed to carry it.
//
// A log is not a secret store. It is read by a strictly larger set than the
// process's own filesystem — pods/log RBAC, any viewer role on the log store,
// any CI job scraping container output — and it persists in a searchable index
// long after the credential it names has served its purpose. A secret in a 0600
// file has an owner and a lifetime; the same secret in a log field has neither.
//
// So the rule is not "never". There is one defensible reason to accept a
// credential in a log: the channel that should have held it failed, and
// withholding it would lock an operator out of their own installation. That
// case is narrow and it is self-evidencing — the call sits inside the error
// branch and carries the error that forced it, so a reader sees why the
// credential is there. An UNGUARDED credential log has no such story and is a
// disclosure on every boot.
//
// Fix a violation by removing the value from the call — log the path, the id or
// a fingerprint — or by moving it under the failure it is the fallback for.
// Never by renaming the key: the key set below is what this gate sees, and a
// rename hides the value from the gate without hiding it from a log reader.
