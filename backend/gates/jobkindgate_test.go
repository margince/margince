//gate:kind falsification H2

package gates

// The registration gate's own falsification. Every shape the tree actually
// uses, proven accepted; the shape it exists to reject, proven rejected.
// Compiled with `go build` rather than asserted by eye, because the claim is
// specifically about what the COMPILER does — and a gate that blocks a
// legitimate author gets weakened by the person it stopped, which is the hole
// the next undeclared job walks back in through.
//
// Two halves, and the second is the one that binds. The scratch module below
// models the SHAPE of the mechanism — a closed union, a narrowed worker
// interface, one entry point constrained to the union — and holds the three
// authoring cases apart with nothing else in the way. But a miniature proves a
// property of itself, so the file then puts the same undeclared registration
// in front of the REAL generated union, through an overlay that writes nothing
// to the tree.
