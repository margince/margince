// Attestation-minting fitness function (ADR-0072 §1). The T1
// correspondence-positive gate spares an address from transactional
// suppression, and its whole safety rests on connector.Counterparty's
// outbound attestation being something a connector cannot state for itself.
//
// The field itself is unexported, so the compiler — not this test — refuses
// every route that sets it directly: a keyed or positional literal, an
// encoding/json unmarshal of a provider payload, reflection, a conversion from
// a look-alike struct, a pointer handed to a row scanner. What the compiler
// cannot refuse is the minting call, WithOwnerAttestation, which is exported
// because the mapper lives in another package. This test keeps that call in one
// place, so the set of code that can mint correspondence evidence stays a set of
// one and is reviewed as such.
//
// The honest boundary: the argument to that call is trusted by construction,
// not by this test. Today's mail connectors pass a bool derived from an
// authenticated provider handle — Gmail's SENT label, an IMAP \Sent special-use
// mailbox, Microsoft's SentItems folder. A future caller passing something
// shaped like `payload.Folder == "SentItems"` from an unauthenticated webhook
// body would satisfy both the compiler and this test while forging exactly what
// the field exists to prevent. Reviewing that argument is a human obligation,
// which is why this test exists to make the call sites few enough to review.
