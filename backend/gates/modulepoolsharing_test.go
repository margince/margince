package gates

// Pool-sharing discipline for the module suites, as a fitness function.
//
// internal/platform/testdb.Pool hands a test PROCESS one pool per DSN, and the
// connections are the cost: a package's tests run sequentially against one clone
// database, so a pool opened per test dials backends, uses them once and closes
// them — while the lane runs several packages at once against ONE server. Every
// module suite used to do that, which is half of what #1744 measures: pools the
// lane's per-pool ceiling never reaches, so the connection budget declared in
// scripts/lib-testdb.sh describes a limit nothing enforces for them.
//
// The gate exists because the shape copies itself. A new suite is written by
// reading the nearest sibling, and nothing else would notice a per-test pool
// coming back — it costs time and connections, never a failure.
//
// SCOPED to internal/modules, and the narrowing is recorded rather than assumed.
// The compose suites take the shared pool through their own harness; the ones
// that ALSO build a pool of their own do it for reasons that differ per file (a
// second pool object on purpose, a pool pinned to one connection, the pool
// machinery's own tests), and #1744 carries them. A tier this gate does not
// judge is a tier that issue names. A MODULE file it does not judge would be a
// hole, which is what the liveness floor below is for.
