// A contention probe that cannot see the backend it is waiting for.
//
// pg_stat_activity is not a live view. Its row set is materialized once per
// TRANSACTION and cached until that transaction ends, so a probe issued inside
// one is answering from a snapshot taken before the racer it is watching for
// existed. A racer whose pooled connection is dialled mid-race is then invisible
// FOREVER — at any budget, on any machine. That is #970, and it cost two issues
// (#548, #516) that read as timeouts and were not.
//
// The trap is that this is a property of the CALL SITE, never of the probe's own
// code, and the obvious reading of a call site is wrong. In approvals,
// waitForRowLockWaiter looked exempt because e.owner is a bare *pgx.Conn — but
// competingTx opens a transaction ON THAT SAME CONNECTION, so pgx ran every
// probe inside it. Nothing in the probe's file says so.
//
// So the obligation is derived rather than remembered: pg_stat_clear_snapshot()
// drops the cache, and any function that asks pg_blocking_pids must call it.
//
// THREE things are required, not one, because co-occurrence is not the
// invariant. The clear must run BEFORE the probe, on the SAME receiver, and that
// receiver must not be a pool:
//
//   - a clear issued after the probe, or in a branch the run never takes, leaves
//     the probe reading the snapshot it was meant to drop;
//   - a clear on a different connection drops a different connection's snapshot;
//   - a POOL is the case that looks right and is not. pool.Exec(clear) acquires a
//     connection, runs, and releases it, so the pool.QueryRow(probe) that follows
//     may be handed another one entirely and the clear provably cannot bind.
//     Acquire once and issue both on that connection.
//
// The first version of this gate required only that both strings appear
// somewhere in the same function, and it certified a pool call site as
// protected. A gate that reads green over the defect it names is the thing this
// file exists to prevent.
//
// Scoped to pg_blocking_pids rather than to pg_stat_activity generally: counting
// sessions by role or database is a census, not a race, and a stale answer there
// is not a blind one.

it ends, so a probe issued inside one cannot see a backend that dialled after the
snapshot was taken — at any budget, on any machine (#970). Whether a connection
is inside a transaction is a property of the CALL SITE and not of the probe: in
approvals it looked exempt because the field is a bare *pgx.Conn, and competingTx
opens a transaction on that same connection.
