// The settings-catalog fitness gates (ADR-0090/A135 §7). Moving a setting's
// validation out of Postgres and into Go is only sound if the obligations the
// CHECK constraints used to carry are DERIVED from the system rather than
// maintained as a list somebody remembers to update. These three tests are
// that derivation:
//
//  1. every registered key is unique and well-formed, and carries the
//     governance a setting needs to be writable at all;
//  2. a key's module prefix names the module that actually declares it —
//     the table-ownership obligation, in a second place;
//  3. no key exists in both the settings registry and margince.yaml's runtime
//     surface, which is ADR-0061 §2's "no key exists in both surfaces"
//     promise, enforced for the first time.
//
// The registry these read is compose's, reached through the exported test
// seam, so a setting that is declared but never registered fails here rather
// than being silently unreachable.
