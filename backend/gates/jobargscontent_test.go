// Job args carry REFERENCES, never content. The erasure engine neutralizes an
// in-flight job by scrubbing the row the job names — comms_outbound goes to
// `parked` and the waking job finds nothing to send. That only works while the
// job holds an id and not a copy: args carrying a body or an address would be a
// second store of subject data that Art. 17 never reaches, sitting in a table
// with no workspace column and no RLS.
//
// TWO arms, and they answer different questions. Neither subsumes the other,
// which is why the second was not dropped when the first was written.
//
// COVERAGE — every field of every COMPILED args struct this build registers
// must be declared in api/jobs.yaml, as an id or as a scalar with the reason it
// is safe. Nothing is inferred from a field's name here, so Snippet, Note and
// Domain are under the same rule as Body, which is the gap a word list cannot
// close. This is the positive assertion: it is total over the fields that
// exist, not over the names somebody thought of.
//
// SUSPICION — a field whose NAME reads like content must carry a rationale even
// when it is declared an id. Coverage alone would let `Body: id` through in
// silence, and that is exactly the line a reviewer should have to argue for. A
// word list is a poor detector and a fine prompt: it cannot decide whether a
// field is safe, and it can insist that somebody said so.
//
// A declared rationale is a WAIVER — a ratified exception to "an args field is
// an id" — so the reasons api/jobs.yaml carries are read as one, and held to
// what gatekit holds every other gate's exceptions to: a reason that states a
// cost, and an entry that still describes a field needing one.
//
// What holds the arms up underneath: gen-jobs refuses a declared field that is
// neither an id nor an argued-for scalar and refuses an empty mapping, and the
// census refuses a declaration and a struct that disagree.
