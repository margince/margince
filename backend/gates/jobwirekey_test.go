// One workspace arg, one spelling, and only where it means something. A kind
// that carries its tenant under a different wire key is invisible to
// `args->>'workspace_id'`; a dispatcher that carries one is counted as a
// tenant's pass it never made. Both directions have to hold, because the reads
// built on this treat a non-null workspace_id as "this job did tenant work" and
// a null as "a dispatcher" — and in each failure the wrong answer looks exactly
// like the reassuring one, which is why this is a gate and not a convention.
