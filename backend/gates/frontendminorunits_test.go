// The browser and the server must scale money by the SAME table, or the integer
// they exchange means two different amounts.
//
// This is not a hypothetical drift. The frontend module first read its digit
// count from Intl, on the reasonable-sounding grounds that the runtime already
// ships one. It ships a DIFFERENT one: Intl follows CLDR, which records how a
// currency is USED, and this table follows ISO 4217, which records what the
// standard ASSIGNS. They disagree on ten codes, two of them ordinary spendable
// money — CLDR gives MGA and IRR zero digits where ISO gives two, and IQD zero
// where ISO gives three. A browser scaling by CLDR against a server scaling by
// ISO is a hundredfold disagreement per affected currency: exactly the defect
// the money sweep removed, reintroduced one currency over, and invisible
// because every OTHER currency agrees.
//
// So the TypeScript table is a deliberate mirror rather than a second answer,
// and this is what makes "mirror" true. It compares both directions: a code
// added to one side and not the other fails, and so does a changed digit count.
