// A unit's SQL addresses the unit's own tables.
//
// The extension runtime hands a unit a workspace-pinned transaction on the
// SHARED application role, so its SQL can name any table that role can reach.
// pkg/extension/runtime.go says so in the open, under "WHAT IS NOT WALLED AT
// ALL": core's tables, another unit's tables, extension_secret. The fix for the
// wall itself is a per-unit database role (#628), and this is not it.
//
// WHAT THIS IS: defence against mistakes, and nothing else. It reads the SQL a
// unit's source spells out and refuses a table that is not the unit's own,
// which is worth doing BEFORE a unit grows the habit — no shipped unit names a
// core table today, so the narrowing costs nothing now and costs a rewrite
// later. A unit is trusted in-process code either way, and a table name the
// source does not spell out defeats a static reader by construction. Read it as
// a lint; the boundary is #628's.
//
// WHAT IT READS. Every .go file a unit ships, tests included: a unit's test that
// seeds a core table is the same mistake as its handler doing so, and it is
// where the habit would start. String CONSTANTS are folded first, because the
// one unit shipping SQL today spells every table through one — `"SELECT " +
// noteColumns + " FROM " + noteTable` is what a real statement looks like here,
// and a gate that cannot see through the concatenation would read green over
// the only SQL in the tree.
//
// A folded string is judged when it OPENS as a statement (`SELECT … FROM …`,
// `INSERT … INTO …`), so that prose which merely contains a keyword — "hello
// from the demo extension" — is not read as a query. Two consequences worth
// stating rather than discovering: a statement whose opening fragment is itself
// computed is not judged at all, and a table name that is computed IS a finding
// (name it with a string constant, and the gate can read it).
//
// The fold has no scopes, and the rules that make that safe are the two the
// gate would otherwise be wrong under. A name resolves only when every binding
// of it in the unit folds to the SAME text, so one function's `table :=
// "person"` is never answered by another function's `table := "ext.…"`; and a
// name bound even once to something unreadable resolves to nothing, so a value
// the fold could read does not stand in for one it could not. Under both rules
// the statement reads as computed — a finding — rather than as allowed.
//
// A CTE is the one name that is not a table, and the exemption for it is bounded
// twice: to the tokens AFTER the body that declares it (inside its own body the
// same name still reads the real table, unless the WITH is RECURSIVE), and to
// the positions a statement READS from. PostgreSQL has no such thing as writing
// a CTE — the target of an UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT or TRUNCATE always resolves to
// the real relation — so a write position takes no exemption at all.
//
// The allowlist is the unit's namespace, not a list of core tables: a table is
// the unit's own when it is `ext.<namespace>_…` — derived through the same
// extension.Name(…).Namespace() the migration gate and the unit's database role
// come from, so the three cannot drift. A bare, unqualified name is refused too,
// and for the reason notes' own constant gives: the ext schema is on no
// search_path the app connects with, so `ext_notes_note` unqualified is a public
// table the unit does not own.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, so that nobody reads more into a green run than it says: a
// statement built by anything other than `+` over constants (a Sprintf whose
// verb is the table, a strings.Builder, a query assembled in a loop) is read as
// far as its literals go and no further. That is the same bound as the header's
// first paragraph and the reason the wall is #628's, not this file's.
