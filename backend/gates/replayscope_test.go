// API-CC-8 as a fitness function: a replay is a read, so every operation
// the idempotency middleware can replay must either re-probe the row scope
// of the record its recorded body carries, or say in writing that the body
// carries no such record.
//
// The operation's 2xx response names its schema, so the route's obligation
// follows from the contract once the SHAPES are classified. Classifying them —
// rowScopedResponses below — is a human judgment this gate cannot make for
// itself; what it does is hold every route answering a given schema to the
// same answer, which is what makes a fix here a class fix rather than a
// one-route one. It catches four kinds of drift: a new replayable route
// landing in neither map, an exemption claimed for a body that does carry a
// record, a reasonless exemption, and a probe aimed at the wrong table or
// field.
