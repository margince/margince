// The attachment-per-message cap as a fitness function.
//
// The number appears in five places and NOTHING makes them agree: `maxItems` on
// three request schemas in the contract, prose in the channel directory's
// `max_files` description, the Go bound the send actually enforces
// (activities.maxAttachmentsPerSend), and the carriage each sending connector
// declares (gmail's and telegram's maxSendableFiles). The contract's is the
// authority; the others are checked against it here.
//
// It is worth a gate rather than a comment because the two failure directions are
// both silent and both wrong in a way a reader would not suspect. A Go bound
// LOWER than the contract refuses a request the published contract says is legal,
// at the door, with a 422 naming a limit no client was told about. A Go bound
// HIGHER is worse: nothing in this stack validates a body against its schema, so
// the contract's maxItems is documentation, and the Go number is the only thing
// standing between one request and thousands of per-file transactions.
