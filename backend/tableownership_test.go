// Table ownership as a fitness function: the import DAG is enforced three
// ways, but nothing in the import graph stops a package from writing SQL
// against a table it does not own. This test closes that gap — it walks the
// hand-written Go under internal/modules and internal/compose, extracts every
// INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE target from SQL string literals (plus the storekit
// applier and row-lock table arguments), and asserts each module only writes its own
// tables. Cross-store writes exist by design (merge relinks, GDPR erasure,
// ingest materialization); each one is ratified below with a self-contained
// rationale — an entry without a rationale is a finding, not a pass, and a
// waiver that matches no remaining write is stale and fails too. SELECTs are
// out of scope: reads are governed by each statement's own workspace predicate
// and the platform/auth row-scope clauses, not by ownership.
//
// That last sentence names two of the three halves of a read's admission and
// stops. The OBJECT half — may this caller read this KIND of record at all — is
// enforced at module store entry points by rbacgate_test.go and, in the compose
// tier, by no gate at all for any core object except `relationship`
// (backend/edgereaders_test.go). Nine compose reads of one table drifted inside
// that gap while a correct implementation sat one directory away, so it is
// written here rather than left to be re-derived: a sentence that lists the
// guards a read has is read as the list of guards a read needs.
