// Command gen-perfdoc renders docs/reference/performance-budgets.md from the
// records the benchmark lane leaves behind.
//
// docs/reference/rbac-matrix.md is the model for the SHAPE — a published page a
// reader who cannot run the lane can still consult — and deliberately not the
// model for the SEMANTICS. That page is derived from the seeded policy and so
// is drift-gated: render it twice, get the same bytes. A latency is measured,
// not derived, so rendering twice never gives the same bytes and a drift gate
// would fail every run for everybody. What this holds to instead is the rule
// aicert's records already follow: a measurement says what it ran on, and a
// budget nobody measured is printed as unmeasured rather than omitted.
//
// That last part is the point. #697 was filed because we publish budgets and
// measure most of them nowhere; a page that listed only what happens to have a
// harness would hide exactly the gap it was written to close.
