// The two rules that make "this file is the whole declaration" true, kept
// beside each other because they answer one question: can a second
// declaration of something reach the emitters without being seen?
//
// Duplicate keys are the third member of that question and need no code
// here: yaml.v3's decoder refuses them by default (uniqueKeys), independently
// of KnownFields, and that default survives into a custom UnmarshalYAML —
// node.Decode builds a fresh decoder which carries uniqueKeys even though it
// drops KnownFields.
//
// The one destination that default does NOT reach is a `yaml.Node`: yaml.v3
// assigns the raw node without going through the mapping decoder, so neither
// uniqueKeys nor KnownFields applies. Nothing in THIS generator decodes into a
// Node — every field it declares is a typed Go value — which is why the
// property holds here with no code. gen-composition's parseOverlay does decode
// into a Node (it must; `update:` holds arbitrary contract fragments) and pays
// for it with an explicit rejectDuplicateKeys walk. So this is a fact about
// this generator's destinations, not a blanket fact about the library.
//
// gen-jobs' rejectDuplicateKinds predates that knowledge and is belt-and-braces
// over the same property with a nicer message; adding a second copy of it here
// would be a third. TestAITasksRejectsDuplicateKey pins the behaviour so a
// yaml.v3 bump that changed the default could not land quietly.

// decodeMapping reads one mapping node into out with unknown keys refused.
//
// It exists because yaml.Node.Decode builds its own decoder and so does NOT
// carry the KnownFields setting parseContract put on the outer one: every
// type below with a custom UnmarshalYAML is a hole in that setting, and a
// typo inside one is dropped in silence. That is not a missing declaration
// but a DIFFERENT one — `kinds: agent_loop` on a site leaves Kind at the
// one_shot default, the opposite certification posture, and
// `conditionals: true` on a company-context policy leaves the caller never
// asked. Re-encoding the node and reading it back through a strict decoder
// is what restores the setting.
//
// This is gen-jobs' contract.go helper, ported deliberately rather than
// shared: the two generators are separate commands in one module with no
// common package between them, and a shared one would exist for this single
// function. If a third generator needs it, that is the moment to lift it.
//
// The destination is a POINTER by signature rather than by convention: yaml
// takes its own destination as an empty interface and reports a value passed
// by mistake at run time, on a document that may not be the one under test.
