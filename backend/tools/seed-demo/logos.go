// The company logos, so a seeded installation looks like a CRM someone uses
// rather than a wall of placeholder initials.
//
// The bytes come from the dataset (datasets/v1/logos/<domain>.png), already
// normalized to the product's own shape — imagenorm.SquarePNG at 300px, the
// edge compose/sitelogo.go uses. The dataset stores them because the crawl
// puts a logo straight into the crawling installation's object store and
// never writes it to disk: the URL survives in report.json, the picture does
// not.
//
// Two writes per logo, in the order the store requires. blobstore.Put lands
// the object, then people.SetOrganizationLogo records the reference; that
// store is deliberately blob-free, so a caller writes the object first and
// the row second. The key carries a fresh UUID per attempt, matching
// compose/sitelogo.go's organizationLogoKey, because a key derived from the
// organization alone would let two concurrent writers overwrite each other's
// bytes while the row named whichever committed last.
//
// A second seed writes nothing: the phase reads which organizations already
// carry a dataset-stamped logo_origin and skips them, so re-running neither
// re-uploads nor orphans objects.
//
// The phase is skipped, not failed, when no blobstore is configured: a seed
// against a stack with no object storage should still produce every other
// record. It goes through blobstore.FromEnv rather than an S3 client of its own,
// so a LOCAL store counts — MARGINCE_BLOBSTORE_PATH pointed at the same
// directory the api reads is a complete answer on a single machine.
