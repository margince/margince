// The company facts the site reader extracted — what each company sells, who
// it serves, what it runs on. About seventy per company, and the richest
// thing the crawl produces.
//
// These are written by calling the product's OWN writer in process, which is
// the only honest way to place them:
//
//   - There is no create endpoint. `POST /organizations/{id}/facts` does not
//     exist and the PATCH that does can only CORRECT a fact a deep read
//     already produced. A fact carries evidence, so the product lets a crawl
//     create one and nothing else.
//   - Going through a crawl would mean re-reading 21 sites on every seed:
//     real model spend, real outbound traffic, and the end of the
//     offline-and-free property the dataset's two caches exist for.
//   - Writing the rows by hand would mean hand-rolling the audit row and the
//     outbox envelope too — a validated structure with a stream router and a
//     trace — and an envelope subtly wrong is a row the fan-out silently
//     never delivers.
//
// So the seeder authenticates as its own session, borrows the store, and
// calls people.ApplyDeepRead. The facts land through the same fill-empty and
// human-precedence machinery a human accept uses, with the same audit and
// outbox pair, and they stay correct when that writer changes.
