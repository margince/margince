// Command seed-demo fills a running Margince installation with the demo
// dataset: the real companies read off their own websites, and the people
// those sites publish.
//
// It writes through the ordinary HTTP API, never into the database, so every
// row it creates carries the same audit and outbox trail a user's would.
// That is the point of seeding this way — a demo database assembled behind
// the API proves nothing about the API.
//
// The dataset lives OUTSIDE this repo (it holds real company names, cached
// third-party pages and synthesized addresses for identifiable people), so
// the path is given at run time and defaults to a sibling checkout:
//
//	go run ./tools/seed-demo -dataset ~/develop/margince-demo-database
//
// Converging, not replaying: every company and person is probed before it is
// created, so a second run adds only what the dataset gained since the first.
// Re-running after editing the dataset is the supported way to extend it.
