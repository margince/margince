// demo.json hand-writes the commercial story for five customers, which is
// right for them: their renewal chains and payment histories carry the demo's
// narrative and no generator would invent them well. It does not scale to the
// 200 companies behind them, and a demo where 195 accounts are identically
// empty is not test data.
//
// So every company that demo.json does NOT name gets a profile derived from
// its domain: a lifecycle, maybe a deal at some stage, maybe a contract,
// documents, a lead, a project. Two properties matter more than realism:
//
//   - STABLE. The assignment is a hash of the domain, so a company keeps its
//     profile across runs and across machines. A re-seed that reshuffled who
//     is a customer would make every screenshot and every bug report stale.
//   - COVERING. Weights alone leave rare states empty by luck. The planner
//     therefore fills the coverage matrix FIRST, promoting companies into
//     under-filled states, and only then applies realistic proportions.
//
// The order is what makes this useful for testing rather than only for demos.
