//
// includeExt selects between the gate's two questions. During validation the
// ext schema's contents are checked relation by relation and this call asks
// only "did anything land ANYWHERE ELSE" — a routine, a type, a schema, a
// default-privilege grant, a relation in another schema. After the revert it
// asks "is anything left at all", ext included.
//
// includeExt narrows the RELATION branch alone, and deliberately: relations in
// ext are the only kind validateCatalog inspects one by one. Every other branch
// reports its objects wherever they live, ext included, because nothing else
// looks at them — an operator or a collation the unit created inside ext is
// outside the allowlist in either phase, and a branch that filtered on schema
// like the relation branch does would let it pass validation AND pass the
// clean-down assertion.
//
// The kinds enumerated are the schema-scoped catalogs that carry an owner
// column, plus one that is not schema-scoped at all. Cluster-scoped objects
// (a foreign-data wrapper, a language, a tablespace) are absent because a role
// holding neither superuser nor CREATEDB cannot make one; if that premise ever
// changes, they belong here too.
//
// The exception is a USER MAPPING, which is here precisely because the role
// cannot create the thing it hangs off. A mapping needs USAGE on a foreign
// server, which an OPERATOR may have granted to PUBLIC on a cluster this gate
// knows nothing about — so it is a capability the unit did not have to mint to
// hold, it survives DROP OWNED BY's reach in the same way, and it is a live
// credential at a remote system. Nothing else in this gate would see it.
//
// Read through pg_user_mappings, the VIEW, and not pg_user_mapping, the table:
// the table holds the mapping options — which is where a password lives — and
// is readable by superusers alone, so querying it from the restricted role this
// inventory runs as fails with `permission denied` and takes every refusal in
// this gate down with it. The view answers the only question asked here (which
// server, mapped for whom) to any role, and hides the options.
