package main

// THE GATE'S PREMISE, HELD FOR ITS OWN TESTS.
//
// extmigrategate applies a unit's migrations as the unit's ext_<name> role and
// then asserts what schema ext holds — every object in it must be one the unit
// under test just created and owns ("the database is thrown away after one run
// and always starts empty", main.go). Everything downstream of that rests on
// it: an object the unit does not own is an object its own down-migration
// cannot revert, so the gate refuses it, by design.
//
// The integration lane hands every package a clone of the shared margince_test
// template, and since cmd/migrate began applying the composed set (Task 8) that
// template carries ext.ext_<name>_* for every enabled unit that ships a
// migrations layer — notes's ext_notes_note today. A clone of it is
// therefore precisely the database the gate is documented not to run on, and
// the tests saw it: the isolation acceptance test refused a correct migration,
// and the FOREIGN TABLE / MATERIALIZED VIEW refusals fired on notes's table
// instead of on the relation the test had planted, so they asserted a message
// about the wrong object. Task 8's review predicted exactly this ("the clone
// always starts empty invariant becomes violable once a unit ships migrations")
// and fixed the production caller, scripts/check-ext-migrations.sh, the same
// way this fixes the test one.
//
// The fix is the same reasoning, not a second mechanism: this package MIGRATES
// ITS OWN throwaway database rather than reverting the template clone's
// extension objects out of the way. Dropping them afterwards would re-implement
// what core's ext-schema migration establishes, and would need extending every
// time an extension namespace grows a kind of object; migrating a fresh
// database makes the premise structurally true instead of restored-after-the-
// fact, and it removes the shared template from the gate's dependencies
// entirely — so the result no longer depends on whether `make test-db-up` or
// the integration lane touched the template last, and the suite is green on a
// second consecutive run with no database reset in between.
//
// VANILLA BY CONSTRUCTION, not by configuration. check-ext-migrations.sh pins
// GOWORK to the root workspace so `go run ./cmd/migrate` resolves the vanilla
// composition stub. Here there is nothing to pin: the database is brought to
// head by testdb.EnsureSchema, the integration lane's one migrate-once
// mechanism, which reads migrations.Core and migrations.Custom and knows
// nothing of the composition — so no environment can put an extension's
// namespace into this database. River is not migrated either: the gate reads
// public.workspace and schema ext, and nothing here touches a job.
//
// The clone the harness gave us is still created and dropped by the harness,
// and is used here for one thing only: the credentials, host and connection
// parameters to reach the cluster. Its schema is never read.
