// Command extmigrategate applies one extension unit's migrations as its
// restricted ext_<name> role against a throwaway database and then asserts
// what the catalog actually holds (ADR-0069).
//
// It is the closing gate of the extension migration rules, and the only one
// that is not textual. gen-composition's pre-apply rule reads the SQL and
// therefore can only refuse the shapes a scanner can see; this one refuses
// what PostgreSQL ended up with. The two halves of that are deliberate:
//
//   - APPLYING AS THE ROLE turns most of the rules into refusals the database
//     issues for free. The role holds CREATE, USAGE on ext and nothing on
//     public, so a migration that writes a core relation, creates a table
//     outside ext, or reaches an unqualified name through search_path fails at
//     the statement rather than being detected afterwards. cmd/migrate opens a
//     single owner connection with no SET ROLE, and in dev and CI that owner is
//     a superuser — exactly the environment this gate runs in — so applying as
//     the owner and inspecting the result afterwards would be a strictly weaker
//     gate that also has to enumerate every way to escape.
//   - ASSERTING POSITIVELY, from an allowlist, is what makes the remainder
//     complete. A denylist of known-bad shapes is only ever as good as its
//     author's imagination; "these relkinds, these columns, this one policy,
//     these grants, nothing else" refuses the shapes nobody thought of.
//
// Usage:
//
//	extmigrategate -unit openchannel -dir extensions/openchannel/migrations -dsn <throwaway>
//
// The DSN must name a THROWAWAY database, migrated to head (the gate needs
// public.workspace and the ext schema) whose owner may create roles. The gate
// creates the ext_<name> role, applies, asserts, reverts, asserts the revert,
// and drops the role again; it never leaves the database or the cluster
// changed on a clean run.
