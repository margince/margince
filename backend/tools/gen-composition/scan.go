// never reaches the walk at all. The two uses are therefore one role — "not
// composed yet, refused on sight" — and stay a single list.
//
// A layer that HAS a composition is governed by that composition's own rule
// and leaves this list entirely. migrations/ was the first: collectUnitTables
// says what its subtree may hold, and it deliberately does NOT re-grant the
// walk exemption, so a Go package under migrations/ is refused exactly like
// one anywhere else in the unit — an init() there would run just as
// unchecked. api/ is the second, on identical terms: collectUnitFragments
// (contracts.go) says what it may hold, and it stays subject to the walk.
// frontend/ was the third and last: collectUnitFrontend (extfrontend.go) says
// what its package must be. Lifting a future layer means the same two edits:
// drop the string here, add the layer's own rule.
