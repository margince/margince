// publishes is read back OUT of build/composition/api/jobs.yaml — the merged
// document — rather than out of the fragment, so what the boot registers and
// what the file says cannot disagree. The result goes into extensions_gen.go as
// Go LITERALS, because the two boot refusals in compose/extjobs.go read Tier
// and RequestedScope and must keep refusing inside a bare role binary.
//
// A scheduled job is TWO kinds. gen-jobs' validateCadence forbids a cadence on
// a worker, so a unit declares a cadenced DISPATCHER and the
// workspace CHILD it fans out to, and this reader pairs them by name:
// ext_<ns>_<job> and ext_<ns>_<job>_ws.

// It is a NARROWER document than gen-jobs' kindDef, and every omission is

//
//   - go_type names a struct in package compose. An extension has none — one
//     shared args pair serves every composed kind — so declaring one would name
//     a Go type nothing could resolve.
//   - fans_out_to / fan_out_unit are DERIVED here: the pair is ext_<ns>_<job>
//     and ext_<ns>_<job>_ws, and a second spelling of an edge this reader
//     computes could only disagree with it.
//   - registration gates a kind on a JobRunnerConfig field. That struct is
//     core's, an extension cannot name a field of it, and a job whose
//     registration depended on core's model lanes would be a unit reaching into
//     the installation's wiring.
//   - opts_owner is fixed by the seam: a dispatcher's opts are its args' and a
//     child's are the fan-out helper's, in compose/extjobs.go.
//
// `job`, `tier` and `scope` are the extension spellings, and they carry what
// jobs.yaml has no core vocabulary for: which Jobs entry the kind joins to, and
// the governance the tick REQUESTS. Strictly decoded (KnownFields), for the
// reason every author-written document in this tier is: a typo'd `scope` on a
// unit that meant `send` would read as an omission and be refused, but a typo'd
// key that fell through would publish a request nobody reviewed.
