// express it. Declared longest-prefix-first, since a shorter entry would
// otherwise shadow a longer one.
//
// The list is deliberately short, and a container that is NOT on it is not

// is, because the two call for different things from the reader: a unit needing
// components.responses is asking for a container nobody has built the
// composition for, and the answer is a reviewed line here. The same posture
// composedWork takes toward go.work directives it does not compose yet.
//
// `queues` is the one omission with an argument BEHIND it rather than merely
// waiting for one, and it belongs here because gen-jobs requires every kind's
// queue: to name a queues: entry, so a reader adding job kinds arrives at this
// list immediately. A River queue is a bound on the process's worker pool,
// shared with core work — an extension declaring one would not be adding a
// capability beside a core node, it would be allocating a share of the
// installation's concurrency from a directory. Composition's own queue set
// (compose/jobqueues.go) would have to become composed too, and the census that
// holds declared bounds equal to built ones with it. So an extension job rides
// one of the pools the installation already declared, and the job composer
// checks that it does (tools/gen-composition/extjobs.go).

//     it looks like an extension node, and gen-recordfields and gen-agentpolicy
//     would compile it into core types the moment they read the composed lane.
//     $.kinds.<core_kind>.<new_key> and $.tasks.<core_task>.<new_key> are the
//     same hole in the other two contracts.
//   - Ordering decided validity: alpha adds $.components.schemas.Shared, then
//     beta targets $.components.schemas.Shared.properties, whose parent exists
//     only because alpha ran first. Deterministic, so never a flake — but
//     alpha→beta composed while beta→alpha errored, and the claimed map cannot
//     see this class at all because the two target STRINGS differ.
//

// leaf, and ownership is a question about the node the leaf lives in.
//
// A target outside every known container is refused outright, which covers both
