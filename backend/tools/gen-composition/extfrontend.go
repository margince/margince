//     mounted, so its first useQuery throws "No QueryClient set" on a page
//     where one is plainly set.

// unitCamel is the one place a unit name becomes a camel-case token, shared by

// about which unit a generated symbol belongs to.
//
// It must be INJECTIVE over the validated unit-name alphabet
// (`^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, extension.Name.Validate), and the obvious
// spelling — title-case every hyphen-separated segment and concatenate — is
// NOT. Upper-casing a DIGIT is a no-op, so `foo-1` and `foo1` both collapsed to
// `Foo1`: two legal, distinct units generating one `Foo1Screen` import and one
// `extFoo1.` copy namespace. That is either a duplicate-identifier failure in
// generated TypeScript nobody wrote, or — worse, in the copy overlay, whose
// keys are strings and cannot clash at compile time — one unit's strings
// silently claiming the other's namespace and mergeUnitLocales blaming the
// wrong directory.
//
// The rule here keeps the readable form and pays only where the ambiguity
// actually is:
//
//   - a segment starting with a LETTER is title-cased, exactly as before, so
//     crm-demo is still CrmDemo and a stack trace still names the unit;
//   - a segment starting with a DIGIT, where the case marker is invisible, is
//     preceded by `_`: foo-1 → Foo_1, which `foo1` → Foo1 cannot equal.
//
// The digit rule is applied to the FIRST segment too rather than skipped as
// redundant, which also keeps a name like `1foo` (legal per the grammar) from
// emitting `1fooScreen` — an identifier no JavaScript parser accepts.
//
// WHY IT IS INJECTIVE. The output is decodable back to the input, so no two
// inputs can share an output. A unit name contains no upper-case letter and no
// underscore, and this function introduces an upper-case letter only at a
// letter-initial segment's first character and an `_` only immediately before a
// digit-initial segment. So in the output, the segment starts are EXACTLY the
// position 0, every upper-case letter, and every `_` — no segment start goes
// unmarked, and no interior position is marked. Split there, drop the `_`s,
// lower-case the result, rejoin with `-`, and the original name is back. The
// inverse is spelled out and exercised in TestUnitCamelIsInjective.
