// rejectLiveInitializers refuses package-level init() and any package-level
// var whose initializer contains a call, in a unit's root package.
//
// Both run at IMPORT — before cmd/api/main.go's composition.Extensions()
// builds anything, before the runtime pool exists, and long before
// RegisterExtensions validates the composed set. Task 1's runtime-role
// assertion cannot reach that window because there is no runtime yet to
// assert about; this AST walk is the only gate that can. Without it, a unit
// could dial a connection, spawn a goroutine, or otherwise do live work
// merely by being imported, which defeats "a declaration is inert data"
// before New() is even called.
//
// This walk targets CALLS specifically, not "runs no code" in general: a
// var initializer that merely holds a composite or basic literal (a unit's
// static table of strings, say) is unaffected because it contains no
// call, and the New() literal-only reader already welcomes exactly that
// shape. containsCall does not claim to enumerate every way an initializer
// could do work at import — a channel receive (var v = <-ch) is a
// *ast.UnaryExpr, not a call, and would slip past this walk the same way a
// composite literal correctly does. That is accepted as out of scope: it
// needs a channel without make to reach, which nothing in this generator's
// literal-only declaration idiom can construct, so no case exercises it. A
// call-bearing initializer is refused even when it is syntactically a type
// conversion: the AST cannot tell a conversion from a call that dials out,
// so — the same reasoning as the Handle rule in astreader.go — the
// conservative rule is the only one that keeps the claim checkable.
