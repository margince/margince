// What comes back is a set of extension.Verb values, which then go two places:
//   - the unit manifest (unitmanifest.go), as the risk tiers an operator resolves;
//   - extensions_gen.go (emit.go), re-emitted as Go LITERALS, because the boot
//     refusals in compose/extensiontools.go read Tier, RequestedScope and
//     Description and must keep refusing inside a bare binary that ships no
//     repository. See extension.Verb.
