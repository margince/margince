// jobs.Config.TestOnly and compose.JobRunnerConfig.TestOnly carry River's flag
// of the same name, which disables machinery that is "useful in production, but
// which may be harmful to tests" — in the pinned river@v0.43.0, the maintenance
// services' staggered startup. A test harness that boots a runner per test pays
// that stagger per test, which is what the flag buys back.
//
// The risk it introduces is one-directional and quiet: a production role that
// set it would run its queue maintainer without the jitter River added on
// purpose, and nothing would fail. There is no failure to observe — the workers
// still work, the jobs still run, and the only difference is that every
// maintenance service in a fleet wakes at once. So the gate cannot be a
// behavioural test; it has to be a census of who sets it.
//
// The field is a bool with a production-safe zero value, so this gate reads
// SETTERS rather than types. It reads one kind of setter only: the one that
// ORIGINATES a value. `TestOnly: cfg.TestOnly` forwards whatever the caller
// chose and is how the flag reaches River through two config structs — flagging
// it would flag the plumbing and leave nowhere to put the field. `TestOnly:
// true`, or any other computed value, is a decision, and a decision belongs in
// a test file.
//
// The forward exemption is bound to the two files that do the forwarding, and
// that is the point: read as "any value ending in .TestOnly", it would admit
// `compose.JobRunnerConfig{TestOnly: appCfg.TestOnly}` — an operator-reachable
// flag threaded from configuration, which is precisely the production setter
// this gate exists to forbid, wearing the shape of plumbing.
