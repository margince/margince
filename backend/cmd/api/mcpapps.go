// RESOLUTION IS ITS OWN CONTRACT, spelled here rather than assumed by analogy.
// --api-base-url's documented fallback is implemented at USE time in
// compose/connectors.go, not by flag parsing, so copying "it falls back" from
// there would have been copying a sentence rather than a mechanism.
//
// The fallback is sound exactly where it matters. --public-base-url is optional
// in general, but the MCP connector gate is a boot error without one — and MCP
// Apps exist only where /mcp is served. So wherever a view could be wanted, the
// chain cannot be empty.
