// The worker role's operator surface: /healthz, /readyz and /metrics on a
// listener of their own (OPS-MET-8's "every service").
//
// The worker is where the dispatchers actually run, and until this file it
// published nothing at all. Every job-runtime gauge is served by cmd/api,
// derived from river_job at request time, and that stays true — a job-table
// projection is fleet-wide by construction and having two roles answer it
// would mean two sources for one number. But it also means a single wedged
// replica is indistinguishable from a healthy fleet: an operator could see
// that work was not being done and not which process was failing to do it.
//
// So this listener carries only what is PROCESS-LOCAL and therefore differs
// per target — the Go runtime, this process's own pool, this process's relay
// counter. It re-serves no job-table gauge, and passes a nil outbox backlog
// for the same reason: that read is the api's, and a second copy of a
// fleet-wide number is a worse operator surface than one copy. It carries no
// workspace id and no tenant data at all, which is what makes it a NARROWER
// surface than the api's /metrics rather than a second copy of it.

//     worker would report ready while the event lanes and the job runner were
//     still coming up, and a rollout could retire the last working replica in
//     favour of one that had not yet picked up a job.
//   - Draining. The probes keep serving through the whole shutdown, because
//     the listener is stopped last so the drain itself stays observable. A
//     terminating replica that still answered ready would keep being sent work
//     it is in the middle of putting down.
