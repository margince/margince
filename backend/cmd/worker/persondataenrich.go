// Wiring the automatic provider-enrichment consumer (ADR-0101/PI-EVT-1).
//
// A consumer rather than a call inside any writer, for the reason the
// auto-enrich lane beside it already argues: person.created reaches the outbox
// through the write shape, so one subscriber covers manual entry, capture,
// import and the site read at once, and covers any writer added later without
// that writer knowing it exists.
//
// It runs in the WORKER because that is where the run is executed. The api
// queues on a human's explicit request; this queues on the customer's standing
// instruction, and both land in the same table for the same worker to drain.
