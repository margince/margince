// The role's logger is the PROCESS DEFAULT, not only the value passed around.
//
// This is the worker, so every job in the installation fails here, and a job's
// failure reaches an operator through jobs.Fault — which logs through the
// package-level slog functions and therefore through slog.Default() and nothing
// else. A role that built a correlation-aware logger and left the default bare
// sent exactly those lines to the stdlib handler: text, on stderr, while every
// other line went to the operator's configured sink in the configured format. A
// collector parsing this role's JSON got an unstructured line for the events it
// most wants, and nothing anywhere said so.
//
// It is asserted from THIS role's own boot path rather than from a hand-built
// logger, because what is under test is the wiring: a test that installed its
// own default would prove slog works and nothing about whether the worker calls
// it.
