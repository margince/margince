// What this proves, precisely: startEventLanes' FAILURE path hands back a value
// join() can use, join() returns, and it closes neither the bus nor the pool it
// was given. run() depends on all three — it defers lanes.join() before it checks
// the error, and the deferred closeBus and pool.Close run after that join.
//
// It needs a real bus and pool because with nil dependencies the lanes
// short-circuit and never start, so the failure path has nothing behind it.
//
// It does NOT prove that join() cancels and waits: whether a lane goroutine is
// still alive at any instant here is a scheduling race, and a subscriber that
// dies on its first bus call is indistinguishable from a healthy one at the
// moment it is launched. That property is proved deterministically, with real
// channels and no clock, by TestJoinCancelsTheLanesAndWaitsForThem.
