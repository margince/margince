// once, below, and every other case here stops before that phase.

// client and no listener to clean up. A phase that moved below the pool would
// turn a typo into a half-built process.
//
// Both cases fail in the flag phase, ahead of the registration. The logger's
// own refusal — the one phase after it — is driven directly by
// TestAnUnknownLogLevelOrFormatFailsTheBoot instead.
