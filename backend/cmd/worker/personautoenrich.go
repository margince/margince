// Wiring the person auto-enrich consumer.
//
// It is a consumer rather than a call inside any writer, and the reason is the
// one linkedinmatchgen.go already argued: matching only at write time means
// every later arrival is a match nobody will ever make. person.created reaches
// the outbox through the write shape, so one subscriber covers manual entry,
// capture, site read, merge and import at once — and covers any writer added
// later without that writer knowing it exists.
