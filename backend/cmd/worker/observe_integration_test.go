// The worker's readiness probe against its REAL dependencies. It is here
// rather than in the unit lane because the probe's whole content is whether
// those dependencies answer: a stubbed pool and bus would prove the stub, and
// a readiness check that cannot fail is indistinguishable from one that always
// passes.
//
// So every check the probe declares is driven BOTH ways below — ready, and
// then broken one dependency at a time. A check nobody can break is one that
// could be deleted with every test still green, which is the same as not
// having it.
