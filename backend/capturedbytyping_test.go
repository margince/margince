// `captured_by` records the PRINCIPAL, and a principal is not a user row.
//
// The value every store stamps is prefixed by kind — "human:<id>" for a
// session, "agent:<id>" for a passport — because an agent acting under
// somebody's passport has no row in app_user. A column typed `uuid`, or one
// carrying a foreign key to app_user, therefore refuses every write the
// product makes, and the refusal reaches a caller as an internal error.
//
// This is a fitness function rather than a fix, because the defect it catches
// already shipped once: migration 0262 typed the contract table's column
// `uuid REFERENCES app_user(id)` and every contract insert 500'd, with the
// whole gate suite green. Nothing derived the obligation from the tree, so
// nothing noticed that one table disagreed with the other thirty.
//
// It reads the FINAL declaration of each column rather than every historical
// one, because a shipped migration is never edited: 0262 stays wrong forever
// and 0265 is what repairs it. What must hold is the shape an installation
// ends up with, which is the last statement to touch the column.
