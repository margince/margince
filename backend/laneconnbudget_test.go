// The integration lane's connection demand is a PRODUCT — concurrent packages
// times what one package may hold — and for most of this repo's life neither
// factor knew about the third number it had to fit inside. INTEGRATION_JOBS was
// raised to 16 in CI, database.NewPool's fallback ceiling was 16 per pool, and
// the compose Postgres never had max_connections set at all, so the lane ran
// against the stock 100 with a ceiling of 256 for its shared pools alone.
//
// Nothing failed reliably, which is the whole difficulty: MaxConns is a ceiling
// and not a reservation, so pgxpool dials lazily and whether a run fits is
// decided by how the bursts happen to overlap. #1109 is what that looks like
// from outside — connect-time failures naming a DIFFERENT package set every
// run, green in isolation, green at INTEGRATION_JOBS=3.
//
// So the obligation is derived from the three files that declare the factors,
// never restated here: a term this test hardcoded would be a fourth number free
// to drift from the other three, which is the defect rather than the gate. What
// IS asserted here is the relation between them.
//
// The mirror matters as much as the sum. A gate that only checks "the terms fit"
// reads green when a term goes missing — an INTEGRATION_JOBS the workflow no
// longer sets, or a max_connections dropped back out of the compose command,
// both leave a smaller number on the left-hand side and pass. Each term is
// therefore required to be PRESENT and non-zero before the arithmetic runs.
