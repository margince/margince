// The forbidigo rule that bans a direct River registration, held to River's
// own API rather than to a remembered list of its spellings.
//
// The closed type set makes an UNDECLARED kind unbuildable, but only along the
// sanctioned path; going straight to River escapes that, escapes jobs.Govern
// (so even a declared kind answers River's option methods for itself again),
// and never records a kind for jobs.MustBeTotal to refuse. The only thing
// holding that door is a regex in .golangci.yml — and a regex naming symbols
// is a hand-maintained list, which is precisely the artefact that goes stale
// on the upgrade nobody reads. It went stale once already, on a pattern
// anchored to AddWorker while AddWorkerArgs and AddWorkerSafely walked past.
//
// So the set is DERIVED, and structurally rather than by name: a function can
// only register a worker if it is handed the bundle to register into, so every
// exported function in package river whose first parameter is *Workers is an
// entry point, whatever it ends up being called. A fourth spelling in a future
// upgrade enrols itself.
//
// River's source is read out of the module cache via `go list -m`, not through
// go/packages: the gate lanes already run under a composed GOWORK workspace
// that `go list` resolves natively, and a parse of the declarations is all
// this needs — no type checking, no build of River itself.
