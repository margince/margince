# CLAUDE.md — operating this repo

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this
repository. It is the long form: the full operating detail lives here.
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is a deliberately shorter digest for other agent
harnesses that links back here. Most sections differ on purpose, so do not sync
them line by line. **Four sections are the exception** — *The write shape*,
*Reuse before you build*, *License headers*, and *Rules learned from the review
loop* — which both files carry in full because both are read in isolation. They
must stay byte-identical, and `TestSharedRulebookSectionsAreIdenticalInBothDocs`
in `backend/agentsdocparity_test.go` fails when they drift: edit one, edit both.

AGENTS.md is machine-read, so keep it accurate: `cli/craft` feeds the **whole**
nearest AGENTS.md into the gate prompt (`gate.Assembler.nearestAgents` walks up
from the touched directories; this root file is the only one in the tree today),
and `make check-craft-doc` separately asserts that **AGENTS.md** still carries a
`## Craftsmanship` heading. When a rule below changes, decide whether the digest
needs it too.

Margince CRM implementation PoC (WP0 foundation + WP1 core spine). This is the
repository the product is built in: the running Go software, its contract, its
tests, and its documentation. There is no separate specification that outranks
what is here.

## What decides a question here

When two sources disagree, this is the order. It replaces the older rule that a
separate specification won every argument.

1. **The explicit current request** from Lars or the team defines what to change.
2. **Code, tests, migrations and `backend/api/crm.yaml`** define what the product
   does today. They are the record of current behaviour, not a description of it.
3. **Guardrails** — security, privacy and lawful processing, agent authority,
   auditability, public contract compatibility, licensing, data durability.
   These are enforced by tests and fitness functions wherever that is possible,
   and the test is the thing to read: it states the obligation in a form that
   fails when the obligation stops holding.
4. **[docs/](docs/)** explains how the product is built and operated.
5. **Retired material** is history. It never blocks work on its own.

The reasoning behind a guardrail — why it was chosen and what it rules out — is
kept by the team and is not part of this repository. A public contributor never
needs it to work here: the rule that binds a change is enforced by a gate, and
when a gate refuses something it names what to do instead. If you cannot tell
why a rule exists and the answer would change your patch, ask in the issue
rather than guessing.

**Do not refuse or narrow ordinary product evolution because an older document
describes a different choice.** Name the conflict and say what it costs. If the
change touches a guardrail, say so in the pull request so the decision behind it
is updated with the code — do not stop. If the call is genuinely someone else's
to make, say whose and why, and open an issue labelled `status: needs-decision`.

Product name **Margince** is locked; older documents say "Gradion CRM" — same
product.

## This repository is public

Everything here is readable by anyone. Two obligations follow:

- **Never refer to a private repository, document, path or link** — not in code,
  comments, tests, docs, issues, commit messages or PR bodies. A public
  contributor must be able to follow every instruction this repository gives
  them. If a rule matters, write the rule out here rather than citing somewhere
  they cannot reach.
- **Never include local machine paths or secrets.**

`TestPublicTreeCitesNothingPrivate` in `backend/publicreferences_test.go` catches
the part of this a test can catch: a private repository name, a `specs/` path or
a `foundation#NNNN` reference in any tracked source or prose file. It does not
read commit messages or PR bodies, and it has no pattern for a secret or a
machine path — those stay your judgement, and the secret-scan gate is the only
other net under them.

A decision number (`ADR-0054`) may appear as a label, but never cite it as
though a reader could open it — the records are not in this tree. Write the rule
itself out here, where a public contributor can read it.

**[docs/principles/](docs/principles/README.md) explains these rules** — six
pages, one per principle, each naming the rulebook section it explains, the
method for checking the tree still holds it, and what it explicitly does not ask
for. That is the PUBLIC explanation and the audit method, which is a different
thing from the private decision rationale described above: a principle page
tells you how to check a rule, not why the team chose it.

The binding short form stays in the rulebooks, and specifically in `AGENTS.md`:
`cli/craft` feeds the whole nearest `AGENTS.md` into its gate prompt, so a rule
relocated to `docs/` stops reaching the gate. Read a principle when you need to
know *why* a rule is shaped the way it is, or when you are auditing a subsystem
against it rather than obeying it on one diff —
[one-source-of-truth.md](docs/principles/one-source-of-truth.md) carries the
six-probe scan for finding a capability that got built twice.

**Start at [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** — open work and the session-pickup point.
Read its *Open work, in one screen* index first and open only the sections that
bear on your change; the file is not meant to be read end to end. Update it at
the end of every working session, keeping it to open work: the narrative of what
you did belongs in the commit and the PR, which is the durable record.

Route findings as you work. Implementation decisions are recorded in the commit
and PR that makes the change — git history is the record. A decision that binds
future work is raised with the team, so the record lands where the reasoning is
kept. Anything found but **not** fixed in the current change — a bug, a gap, a
follow-up — becomes a GitHub issue in this repo. When to file is the engineer's
call.

### Label every issue you file (three axes, no exceptions)

An unlabeled issue is indistinguishable from an untriaged one, and that is the
invariant the labels exist to protect: **unlabeled means nobody has looked at it
yet.** File an issue without labels and you have quietly told the next reader a
falsehood about your own finding. Every issue you open carries **exactly one
`priority:` and exactly one `area:`**.

**Priority** is a claim about severity, never about your schedule. Do not demote
a real defect because it is not this week's work — the milestone carries the
schedule, the label carries the truth:

| Label | It qualifies when |
|---|---|
| `priority: critical` | Data loss, a reachable security or privacy breach, `main`/CI red, or the product unusable on a default install. Drop other work. |
| `priority: high` | A real user or operator hits it on a live path, or it blocks another workstream. |
| `priority: normal` | A genuine defect that is narrow, guarded, or unreachable today; hygiene; test-lane work; polish. |
| `priority: low` | A want, not a defect — or it needs a product decision before it is work at all. |

The honest test for `critical` is not "how bad would this be" but "does this stop
somebody else from working, or is somebody's data wrong right now". A flaky gate
earns it not because it is severe but because a red run nobody trusts makes every
other verdict unreadable.

**Area** is where the fix lives, one only, so a filter never double-counts:
`agents-mcp` · `ai-models` · `authz` · `capture` · `ci-tests` · `contract-api` ·
`deals` · `extensions` · `finance` · `frontend` · `overlay` · `platform` ·
`privacy` · `records` · `reports`. A doc that is wrong about a subsystem takes
that subsystem's area, not a documentation area — it belongs next to the code it
misleads about.

**Status**, when it applies — these mark an issue that is not yet workable, and
leaving them off puts unactionable work in somebody's queue:

- `status: needs-decision` — unactionable until a human rules ("decide or decline X").
- `status: needs-decision` also covers work that is blocked on a product ruling
  rather than a technical one. Say what the options are and which you recommend;
  an issue that only asks "what should we do?" gives the decider nothing to
  decide from.

**Provenance**, additive and independent of the three axes: `bug`,
`enhancement`, `security`, `capability-gap` (a missing capability, not a defect),
and `fast-track-debt` (shipped fast under time pressure with the gap recorded
deliberately). These record *why the issue exists*, which is the one thing
nobody can reconstruct later — prefer keeping them over tidying them away.

**`security` is not a way to report a vulnerability.** This repo is public, and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) is explicit that an exploitable weakness goes to a
private GitHub Security Advisory, never a public issue or pull request, because
a public report before a fix ships puts every deployment at risk. The label is
for hardening and defence-in-depth work that carries no live exploit. The test
is the one SECURITY.md itself implies: **if you can write the reproduction, it
belongs in an advisory** — a cross-tenant read, a row-scope or RBAC escape, an
agent-governance bypass, a forged or still-binding revoked credential, a
mutation that skips the audit or outbox row, injection, SSRF.

Before filing, check whether a **parent tracker** already covers the finding
(`gh issue list --label "area: <x>"`); if one does, attach yours as a sub-issue
rather than adding a sibling to the pile. A tracker carries the highest priority
among its children.

## Build / test / seed

All Go code lives under `backend/` (one Go module,
`github.com/gradionhq/margince/backend`); the root Makefile delegates there.

```
make install            # one-shot fresh-worktree setup: FE deps + gate tools + hooks
make db-up              # start PG16 + Redis 7 containers, create the app role
make migrate            # apply core + custom migrations (owner DSN)
make check              # the full merge gate = check-backend + check-fe
make check-backend      # backend half; this is what CI's deterministic-gates runs
make check-fe           # frontend half (biome + vitest + tsc + build)
make test-integration   # real-Postgres lane: RLS gates + HTTP end-to-end (needs db-up).
                        # Ends with `OK: integration passed with 0 skips` — it fails
                        # loudly without a database rather than skipping silently
make dev                # full local stack: the app on :8080, worker always on
make dev-stop           # stop the stack
make dev-logs           # follow the stack log, coloured per process
```

What each target actually runs, plus `check-q`, `check-go`, `fe-typecheck`,
`fe-uat`, `infra-up`/`infra-down`, and the `DEV_SLUG` flags:
[docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md).

### EXACTLY ONE dev stack at a time (non-negotiable)

**`make dev` enforces this itself — it sweeps before it starts.** A bare
`make dev` kills every margince api/worker/vite on the machine (recorded,
orphaned, or from another checkout), evicts whatever holds :8080, drops every
leftover `margince_dev_*` database, and only then boots ONE stack. So `make dev`
is always safe to run; you no longer stop the old stack by hand. Bare
`make dev-stop` is the mirror and stops EVERY stack; `DEV_SLUG=x` gives an
isolated stack that the sweep spares, until the next bare `make dev` takes it
down. Details and the other targets:
[docs/reference/make-targets.md](docs/reference/make-targets.md).

Two failures this prevents, both of which look exactly like a bug in your code:

- **A stale api still serving :8080.** A binary started from an earlier branch
  keeps answering happily while Vite hot-reloads the code you just wrote. The
  SPA then calls endpoints that binary has never heard of. An old server is
  indistinguishable from a broken feature.
- **A backend change that never reached the browser.** The api is compiled —
  Vite hot-reloads the frontend, the API does not. Every backend change (new
  endpoint, migration, handler fix) needs `make dev` again.

This working tree is often shared with parallel agent sessions that switch
branches under you. Before you trust ANY manual test, confirm both:
`git branch --show-current` is the branch you think it is, and the api on :8080
was started after your last backend change.

The CI pipeline that runs these gates as required checks — the change
classifier, the job graph, and the SonarCloud coverage flow — is documented in
[infra/ci-pipeline.md](infra/ci-pipeline.md).

Three process-role binaries, all wired through
`internal/compose`: `cmd/api` (HTTP; inline outbox relay behind
`--inline-relay`, default true), `cmd/worker` (standalone relay),
`cmd/migrate` (up|down).

MCP (Surface A2): the api serves the governed tool surface at `/mcp`, on the
same origin as `/oauth/*` and the discovery documents — A1 stdio and its
`cmd/mcp` binary are retired (SCR-9). A client needs only the URL:
`claude mcp add --transport http margince <base>/mcp` walks discovery, DCR,
consent and the token exchange itself. `tools/list` advertises only what the
presenting passport's scopes admit. A passport is also a REST Bearer
credential, governed exactly like MCP (ADR-0055, superseding the old
"read-only on REST" C1 rule) — 🟢 mutations auto-execute, 🟡 ones stage for
confirm-first approval, all still capped by the granting human's live
seat/RBAC. Every call re-authenticates: revocation binds mid-session.

Host requirements: Go ≥ 1.26, Docker, and `golangci-lint` (the codegen
tool chain is pure Go, in its own module `backend/tools/`).

One installation serves one organization (A107/ADR-0061): the server resolves
its singleton organization itself — no request selects a tenant. First boot
bootstraps the organization + admin from `margince.yaml`, which `make dev`
seeds from `config/margince.example.yaml` on first run and then **leaves
alone**, so your edits survive a restart; delete it to reset.

`/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` sit next to `/v1`. The config file, the
CLI flags and their env equivalents, and the operational endpoints are all
documented in [docs/reference/configuration.md](docs/reference/configuration.md).

## Shipping a change (branch → local gates → PR → green → merge)

Every commit lands through this loop — code, docs, and config alike.
Direct pushes to `main` are blocked by branch protection; there is no
other path to merge.

**Run repository publishing with host access.** In a sandboxed agent session,
`gh auth status` is not authoritative because the sandbox may not see the host
keychain even when the active host account is valid. Run the authentication
check again with host escalation before asking the user to re-authenticate.
Every repository or remote mutation must likewise run with host escalation,
including branch creation, commit, rebase, push, PR create/edit/merge, and PR
check monitoring. Read-only working-tree inspection (`git status`, `git diff`,
`git log`) may stay sandboxed.

1. **Branch off `main`**: `git switch -c <type>/<slug> origin/main`.
2. **Sign off every commit** (`git commit -s`) — the DCO gate rejects a
   PR containing any commit without a `Signed-off-by` trailer.
3. **Local gates BEFORE pushing**: `make check` (the merge gate — build,
   vet, lint, arch-lint, unit tests, contract drift); add
   `make frontend-check` when `frontend/` changed. The pre-push hook
   (installed once via `make hooks` — the **root** target, which sets
   `core.hooksPath`) runs `craft static --strict` diff-scoped on top — a
   BLOCKER or MAJOR finding stops the push; fix it, never bypass the hook.
   When a push does change hand-written backend Go, the hook then also runs the
   two sub-second whole-tree greps (`check-rls-store-path`,
   `check-no-jurisdiction`), so an RLS-bypassing store statement or a
   jurisdiction string in core fails locally rather than in CI. A push with no
   qualifying backend Go changes exits before all three — a docs-only push runs
   none of them.
4. **Push the branch and open a PR** (`gh pr create`).
5. **Watch the GitHub gates and fix red**: CI, DCO, CodeRabbit, and
   SonarCloud must all pass (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`). Fix failures
   locally, re-run the local gates, push again; address CodeRabbit
   findings rather than dismissing them.
6. **Merge only when everything is green** (squash is the house style:
   `gh pr merge <n> --squash`), then delete the branch. Never merge over
   a red or still-running check.

### Never commit machine or session debris

Only product — code, tests, docs, config templates — belongs in a commit.
Before you `git add`, check `git status` for anything that is a build cache,
a working note, or a screenshot, and leave it out:

- **Build caches** — `.pnpm-store/`, `node_modules/`, compiled binaries.
  Regenerable, machine-local, never tracked.
- **Session scratch** — put working notes, plans, and intermediate output in
  the session's scratchpad temp dir, **not** a `scratchpad/` at the repo root.
- **Screenshots / captures** — a `*.png`/`*.jpg` you took to look at something
  is debris unless the product or the repo docs intentionally reference it
  (e.g. imported from `frontend/src/assets/`, or embedded in a docs page).

`.gitignore` catches the known offenders (root-anchored images, `/.pnpm-store/`,
`/scratchpad/`), but the rule is yours to keep — a new debris path it doesn't
yet list must still stay out, and be added to `.gitignore` when you spot it.

## Layout (ADR-0054: the modules/platform/shared triad, three `cmd/<role>` binaries)

The `backend/internal/{modules,platform,shared}` triad — the DAG is
`shared → platform → modules → compose → cmd`, enforced three ways
(depguard, go-arch-lint, `backend/arch_test.go` fitness tests):

- `internal/shared/` — Tier-0 leaves, stdlib-only (test-enforced):
  `kernel/{ids,events,provenance,principal}`, `apperrors` (the fixed
  sentinel registry — extend it only alongside the error contract it
  implements, never for one call site), and
  `ports/{authz,datasource,mcp,connector,workflow,model,retrieval,extraction,fieldcatalog,jurisdiction}`
  (the frozen seam interfaces + additive provider mechanics).
- `internal/platform/` — technical plumbing, owns no domain:
  `database` (pg pool + the `WithWorkspaceTx` GUC contract that binds every
  tenant statement's workspace predicate) +
  `database/storekit` (the ONE spelling of the audit+outbox write shape,
  keyset cursors, version patches), `auth` (the ONE admission point:
  `Admit` (scope ∧ tier) + object RBAC + row-scope clauses incl. the
  activity link-walk), `events` (outbox relay/subscriber/dedupe),
  `dbmigrate`, `httperr` (RFC 7807 + wire helpers), `httpserver` (chassis).
- `internal/modules/` — twenty-one bounded capabilities, flat by default per
  ADR-0054 §3 (store + mapping + transport + provider in one package),
  growing subpackages only when a named trigger fires (split for a reason,
  never symmetry). **A module NEVER imports a sibling** — if capability A
  needs B, compose injects the edge. A module writes only the tables it
  owns, declared in its `doc.go` and gated by
  `backend/tableownership_test.go`.
  Which module owns what — purpose, spine shape, owned tables, and HTTP
  surface for all twenty-one, plus the compose-owned tables and the notable
  subpackages — is the table in
  [docs/reference/modules.md](docs/reference/modules.md). Read it to place a
  change; don't guess from the package name.

  Two sanctioned spine shapes, and ONLY two — don't invent a third:
  **Handlers→Store** for CRUD modules (people, deals, activities, …:
  the store owns the transactional write shape and the RBAC gate at its
  entry points) and **Handlers→Service** for engine modules (approvals,
  identity: a service owns the multi-step domain logic and drives the
  SQL inside it).
- `internal/compose/` — the composition layer every process role shares:
  the contract HTTP surface (`Server` embeds every module's handler set and
  asserts `crmcontracts.ServerInterface` itself — a contract operation with
  no real handler fails that assertion at compile time, not a 501 at
  runtime), the composite `datasource.SystemOfRecordProvider`, the MCP registry +
  approvals adapter, and the cross-module integration suites (in
  `compose/integration`, with the shared harness). Every cross-module
  edge is injected HERE (identity's workspace seed ← deals; agents'
  staging ← approvals). Cross-module ORCHESTRATION groups live in
  subpackages under the same named-trigger growth policy (`compose/briefs`
  is the pilot); a compose subpackage never durably owns a business
  entity.
- `internal/contracts/` — GENERATED from `backend/api/crm.yaml`. Never edit.
- `backend/api/crm.yaml` — the authoritative OpenAPI 3.1 contract.
- `backend/migrations/core|custom/` — the ADR-0017 namespaces.
  `modules/<name>/custom/` + `migrations/custom/` — the fork-owned seam:
  upstream never writes there (ADR-0054 §7).
- `backend/tools/` — the codegen tool chain (contract-overlay,
  gen-stubs, gen-agentpolicy); its own Go module so the generators'
  dependencies stay out of the product module's go.mod.
- `frontend/` — the Vite/React web UI: a standalone static build served
  separately from the API binary (which serves `/v1` only — no embedded
  SPA); `make frontend-check` / `make dev` exist at the repo root.
  **Working in here? Read [frontend/CLAUDE.md](frontend/CLAUDE.md) first**, and
  then the file it opens with:
  **[frontend/src/design-system/README.md](frontend/src/design-system/README.md)
  is the catalog of every control that already exists** — cards, buttons,
  inputs, fields, badges, tables, menus, dialogs, empty states. Open it BEFORE
  building anything visible. Every interactive control comes from
  `frontend/src/design-system/`; a native `<select>` fails
  `frontend/scripts/check-native-controls.sh`, but nothing automated can tell
  that the component you just wrote already existed under another name, which is
  how this tree has twice grown a second spelling of a card.
- `extensions/<name>/` — the stable extension tier (ADR-0120): each unit
  is its own Go module importing ONLY the marker-allowlisted
  `backend/pkg/**` surface; presence under `extensions/` is the
  enablement. The vanilla tree ships four first-party units: `de` (the
  German jurisdiction pack — GoBD calendar-year retention floors),
  `notes`, `relay-probe` (the provider-facing reference — capture, a
  merge-key declaration and a transport) and `yogi` (one served 🟢/read
  agent tool — the worked example of the governed-tool kind).
  Read `extensions/` for the live list rather than trusting this sentence — a
  count in prose goes stale the first time somebody adds a unit. `make composition` (run by every build lane)
  generates the ignored `build/composition/` wiring; `composition/` at
  the root is the committed vanilla stub so bare go commands resolve.

## DO NOT TOUCH

- `internal/contracts/api_gen.go`, `internal/compose/stubs_gen.go` —
  generated (`make gen`); the drift gate fails a hand edit.
- `migrations/core/*` that have shipped — additive migrations only. An applied
  version never re-runs, so editing one changes what FRESH installations get
  while every deployed database keeps the old behaviour: the two diverge
  silently. Editing history without a second, additive half that reaches
  already-deployed databases is how an installation ends up permanently missing
  a backfill nobody can see is missing.

  **Two authorized exceptions in this tree's history**, and both name the reason
  they were safe rather than the fact that they happened:

  1. The 2026-08 tenant-scope sweep edited applied migrations and shipped WITH
     additive repair migrations, so every already-deployed database was reached.
  2. The 2026-08-21 baseline consolidation replaced core's 318 migrations and
     custom's 24 with one baseline file each. It carries NO repair half and
     needs none, because at the time there was no production installation and
     every database was rebuildable — and rather than reach a stale database it
     STOPS one: the baseline reuses version `0001`, whose ledger row on such a
     database names a migration that no longer exists, so
     `dbmigrate.assertLedgerMatches` refuses and says `make dev-fresh`.

  Neither exception generalizes. The second is available only while no
  installation holds data somebody cannot rebuild, and it was checkable only
  because `scripts/migration-baseline.sh verify` could prove the baseline builds
  the schema the history built, byte for byte.
- The `database.WithWorkspaceTx` GUC contract — every tenant query goes through
  it; there is no raw-pool path for tenant data. Core tenant isolation is a
  per-statement predicate bound by that contract and held by
  `scripts/check-rls-store-path.sh`; core carries no row-level security at all
  (a migration retired it, and the baseline has never declared a policy).
  Extension tables still carry FORCE RLS.
- `internal/shared/apperrors` — the fixed sentinel registry; extend it only
  alongside the error contract it implements, never for one call site.

## The write shape (non-negotiable)

Every mutation commits domain row + `audit_log` row + `event_outbox` row
in ONE transaction — spelled once in `platform/database/storekit`
(`Audit` + `Emit`), called by every module store. `captured_by` is
stamped from the authenticated principal, never from the request body.
The outbox envelope is the `shared/kernel/events` contract (events.md
§2): the HTTP layer mints one `correlation_id` per request, `Audit()`
returns the audit row id, `Emit()` links both into the trace —
publishing is ALWAYS through the outbox (`platform/events.Relay` ships
it; no direct XADD from domain code) and consumers wrap handlers in
`events.Dedupe` because the bus is at-least-once. Every store entry
point is RBAC-gated (`auth.Require` + `auth.EnsureVisible` + the list
scope clauses in `platform/auth`): object denial →
`apperrors.ErrPermissionDenied` (403), row-scope miss →
`apperrors.ErrNotFound` (404, existence-hiding).

## Reuse before you build (non-negotiable)

A second implementation of one capability is not untidy — it is two answers to
one question, and the two drift until they disagree in front of a user. Four
rules, each of them here because this tree has already paid for it.

**1. Search the whole tree, not your directory.** Before adding a capability,
grep its nouns across `backend/`, `frontend/src/` and `extensions/`. The
duplicate is almost never in the package you are editing — that is precisely why
it gets missed. The agent tool `prep_for_meeting` was written beside a working
`compose/meetingbrief/` that a one-word grep would have found, and the two
answered one question with different grounding rules until a seam was written.

**2. The tool surface and the web surface share ONE engine.** An MCP tool never
re-derives what an HTTP handler already computes. The binding is a
`compose/*seam*.go` file, and the seams that exist each state the rule in their
own words — `briefseam.go`: "one queue rather than two readings of it";
`importseam.go`: "it delegates rather than reimplementing, and that is the whole
design". **If no seam exists for the capability you need, write the seam** — do
not write a second assembler. A module may not import a sibling or `compose`
(ADR-0054 §3), so rolling your own will always look like the cheaper path; it is
the wrong one, and this is the case where saying so out loud is the only thing
that helps.

**3. Never hand-type a SQL placeholder.** Derive `$N` from the argument slice —
`args = append(args, v)` then `fmt.Sprintf("%s = $%d", col, len(args))`, as
`deals/offer_lines.go` does — or use `storekit.InsertFragments`. Nothing in this
repo checks that a statement's column count, placeholder count and argument
count agree, so a hand-numbered statement is one careless sweep away from
binding every column to the wrong value. That is not hypothetical: it shipped in
`people/researchclaim.go`, and the accept path was dead for two days because no
test executed the statement.

The `%s` in that pattern is the COLUMN, and it carries its own rule: a compile-
time literal, or a catalog name quoted with `pgx.Identifier.Sanitize` — the one
spelling this repo uses (`storekit/customcolumns.go`). Never a string off a
request body. Values are always `$N`; only identifiers are ever formatted, and
an identifier a caller chose is an injection with a placeholder's manners.

**4. A comment may not claim to be the only implementation unless a test holds
it.** "the one spelling of X", "the only writer of Y", "the same anonymization
the eraser performs" — if no test fails when a second one appears, delete the
claim or write the test. Nine of the ten claims counted in this tree were
false. A false uniqueness claim is worse than silence: the next author greps,
finds it, and stops looking.

**Two writers of one invariant either share a helper or say why they do not.**
If you are adding the second, put the reason in the code beside it, not in the
pull request where the next reader will not see it.

Catalogs to read before building anything they might already list:
[docs/reference/modules.md](docs/reference/modules.md) for backend capabilities,
[frontend/src/design-system/README.md](frontend/src/design-system/README.md) for
every control that already exists.

## Craftsmanship

The anti-tell catalog T1–T11, in full below — this list is the rule, not a summary
of one kept elsewhere. The rule under every rule:
**code that reads best to a human reads best to the next agent that edits it** —
legibility is the product, not polish.

- Comments say *why*, not *what* (T1). Domain names, not `data/tmp/helper` (T4).
- **Never swallow an error** — no `_ = f()`, no empty `catch`, no ignored return;
  errors flow through the sentinels, and messages are actionable and never leak
  internals (no stack/SQL/table names to a client) (T2).
- No `any`/`as`/unchecked assertions (T6). No dead or speculative code, no
  abstraction without a second concrete caller today, no `TODO` without an issue
  ref (T3/T8).
- Handle the honest hard cases (empty page, version skew, cross-tenant, GUC-unset) (T7).
- **Tests prove behaviour or they are noise (T11):** no assertion-free test (it can
  only fail by panicking), no `time.Sleep` / real-clock / real-network flakiness, no
  over-mocking that asserts call-order; mock only true boundaries (DB/HTTP/clock/queue)
  and inject a `Clock`. Tests read as specs; the integration lane fails loudly without a
  database — a skipped security gate looks exactly like a passing one.
- **Pre-submit self-check:** would a senior write it this way? does it match the
  surrounding file? do the errors say what-went-wrong *and* what-to-do? would a stranger
  find where this change lives without a guide? is this the smallest diff that does the job?

**The gate runs before every push (diff-scoped), and it is STRICT.**
`.githooks/pre-push` runs the deterministic arm — `craft static --strict` (the repo's
`cli/craft` tool, ADR-0045) — over the Go files **this push changes vs
`origin/main`** in `backend/`, `extensions/`, `fixtures/` and `desktop/` alike (a
first-party extension unit and the desktop launcher both ship the same product). There is no pre-existing backlog to exempt: the whole tree was
cleared to zero findings before this bar was armed, so the rule is simply that
touched code is clean. Write it right the first time — a swallowed error, a sleep
in a test, a bare `any` in a signature, or an 81-line function you add will block
your push.
- Install the hook once after cloning: **`make hooks`** (sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`).
- Full manual sweep of every hand-written Go tree (`backend/`, `extensions/`,
  `fixtures/`, `desktop/`): **`make craft-static`** — green, and the
  CI `craftsmanship` job runs the same bar as a required check.
- `BLOCKER` and `MAJOR` findings both block; `MINOR` is advisory. The size ceilings
  are 80 CODE lines / 500 file lines for product code and 160 / 1000 for `*_test.go`
  — a long scenario test that sets up, acts and asserts once is not the
  god-function smell, but a suite still splits when it stops being navigable.
  A comment-only line is not length for the FUNCTION ceiling: it asks how much a
  reader must hold at once, and an explanation reduces that. The whole-tree file
  check in `scripts/check-go-file-length.sh` is a plain `wc -l` and counts every
  line, with a ratchet file freezing each pre-existing offender.
- A *genuine* false positive is waived **in-source with a reason**: `//craft:ignore <check> <reason>`
  (a reasonless waiver is itself a finding).

## License headers (every new hand-written Go file)

Every hand-written `*.go` file starts with the BUSL-1.1 SPDX header — the
two lines at the very top, above the `package` clause, followed by a blank
line:

```go
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Gradion
```

Exempt: generated files (`*_gen.go`) and the drift-frozen
`internal/contracts/` package — do NOT stamp those. The rule is enforced by
`TestEveryHandWrittenGoFileCarriesTheLicenseHeader` in
`backend/license_test.go` (part of `make check`), which derives the file
list from the tree — `backend/`, `extensions/` and `fixtures/`, since each
unit is its own module — so a new file that skips the header fails the gate.
Keep the copyright line as-is (`2026 Gradion`); it names the release year,
not the current year. This is the license model's "honest labeling / don't
strip notices" obligation (spec `business/12-license.md` §5, §8).

## Rules learned from the review loop (binding)

Full rationale in [README.md](README.md#engineering-rules-learned-from-the-review-loop);
the short form:

1. **Fix the invariant, not the call site** — grep every mutation/read
   site of the same column/constraint/record and fix them as one change
   (the recurring reviewer catch here was "fixed the case under review,
   missed the sibling copy").
2. **Prefer fitness functions over point fixes** — derive the obligation
   from the system (e.g. every tenant statement carries its workspace
   predicate; every CHECK violation maps to a 4xx; `backend/arch_test.go` derives
   its package lists from the tree), don't maintain it as a list.
3. **Anything that returns a record is a read** and carries the row-scope
   gate — including replay, conflict, and error paths.
4. **No build-process residue in comments** — no review-ticket numbers or
   fix narration; state the invariant so it stands alone. History belongs
   to git, not the source. Same for test names.
5. **Never rationalize a known gap in a comment** — restructure it away
   or gate it with a test.
6. **A test that supplies its own version of production proves nothing
   about production** — hand-inserted rows the real writer never writes,
   or a hand-copied adapter mirroring what compose wires. Seed through
   the real writer; if a test needs the wiring, reach for the wiring
   (integration tests live directly in `package compose` so unexported
   adapters are in scope). An unexpectedly uncovered new file usually
   means a test double stands where the real thing should.
